// Cases - progress store.
//
// A thin zustand store over the pure helpers in ./progress. It owns the
// per-run progress map plus the per-case sample-project selection, and persists
// both to localStorage so a half-finished case (and the project you were
// learning it on) survive reloads and a hop into a module and back. All real
// logic lives in ./progress (pure, tested); this layer only reads/writes and
// persists.
//
// It also owns two small pieces of view state for the Cases hub itself (not
// per-run progress): the "I work as..." company type the user picked, and
// which cases they pinned to which real project. The filters are plain
// localStorage, same pattern as the progress map above. The pins are not: they
// live on the server under `/v1/cases/pins/`, because the set of cases someone
// curated for a job belongs to their account and not to one browser. What is
// in localStorage under `oe_cases_pins` is a mirror of that list, kept so the
// hub has something to show before the first read lands and after one fails.
