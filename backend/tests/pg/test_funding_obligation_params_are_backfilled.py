"""``v41_funding_obligation_detail`` must fill NULL ``detail_params`` rows.

The revision is inspector-guarded so it can run on an installation whose
tables came from ``Base.metadata.create_all`` plus the boot heal rather than
from walking the chain. On that installation both columns already exist when
the revision runs, so both ``add_column`` calls are skipped - and before the
backfill was added, skipping them made the whole revision a no-op.

That mattered because the two columns do not arrive in the same state. The
heal renders a model default into DDL only when the value has a literal
spelling. ``detail_key`` carries ``default=""``, a scalar, and lands NOT NULL
DEFAULT ''. ``detail_params`` carries ``default=dict``, a callable the ORM
evaluates per row, which has no DDL spelling, so it lands nullable with no
default and every row written before the model grew the column keeps it NULL
for good. Measured on the local database: exactly that split.

``ObligationOut`` tolerates the NULL on the way out, and
``tests/modules/funding/test_funding_obligation_row_predating_columns.py``
holds that belt in place. This file is the other half: the stored value itself
has to be repaired, because a tolerant reader is not a repaired row and every
other consumer of the table - an export, a report, a query - reads the column
directly.

The trap this file is built to avoid is that a test running against a plain
``create_all`` schema proves nothing at all. There the column is NOT NULL, no
row is NULL, the UPDATE matches zero rows, and the test goes green having
executed none of the behaviour it names. So the healed shape is built here
first, and a negative control asserts the NULL is really there before the
revision runs.
