# DDC-CWICR-OE: DataDrivenConstruction - OpenConstructionERP
"""Coordination data has to reach every project, not the first few.

Both seeders took a prefix of the project list and said so in a comment, so
nothing read as broken: the code did exactly what it claimed. The screens it
leaves behind cannot show it either - a project with no federation and no clash
run renders the same empty coordination hub as a project whose seed crashed.

Two failures are pinned here rather than one, because lifting the cap alone
changes nothing on a database that has been seeded before. Both seeders also
read a marker off ``project_ids[0]`` and treated the whole seed as done when
that one project already had rows, so every project added or uncovered later
stayed empty however many times the seed re-ran. The per-project assertions
below are the ones that fail on that marker and pass without it.

Assertions go through each module's own project-scoped read, not through a row
count: coverage is what the screen asks for, and a count over the whole table
is satisfied by three well-fed projects and seven empty ones.
