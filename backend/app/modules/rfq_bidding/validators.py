"""Pure completeness and comparability checks for an RFQ and its bids.

Validation is first-class for this module (platform principle #4). An RFQ has
two moments that cannot be taken back. Publishing sends the package to vendors,
who then spend real estimating hours on it; a package that was unpriceable or
already closed wastes their time and returns nothing usable. Awarding turns one
of the returned numbers into the basis of a purchase order or a subcontract,
which means the comparison that picked it has to have been a comparison of like
with like.

The two moments ask different questions, so they are two rule sets:

``rfq_issue``
    Everything a vendor needs in order to bid at all, including whether the
    submission deadline is still in the future. Run from
    :meth:`RFQService.issue_rfq`.

``rfq_award``
    Everything the comparison between bids relies on. Run from
    :meth:`RFQService.award_bid`. The deadline-in-the-future check is
    deliberately absent here: by award time the deadline has passed on purpose,
    and a rule that failed for that reason would fail every award forever.

Splitting the sets rather than passing an ``operation`` flag into the payload is
deliberate. A rule whose behaviour depends on a string the caller supplies is
the same hazard as a rule registered into a set nobody calls: it is reachable on
paper and dormant in practice, and no reachability test can tell the difference.
Two named sets each have a named caller.

Like ``procurement/validators.py`` the checks themselves are deliberately
**dependency-free**: standard library plus :class:`~decimal.Decimal`, no ORM, no
FastAPI, no session. The rule classes at the end of the file import the core
validation engine, and the core money renderer they quote amounts with, and
nothing else.

The clock is data, never ``date.today()``
-----------------------------------------
:data:`AS_OF_KEY` carries the date the checks treat as today. The service fills
it; a test passes it explicitly.

Two layers, one rule set pair
----------------------------
The check functions below are pure and are wrapped by rule classes in
``app.core.validation.rules`` (the ten that shipped with the module). The rule
classes further down this file are the module's own, registered into the same
two sets by :func:`register_rfq_validation_rules` from the package startup
hook. They cover what the module learned to model afterwards: the scope lines,
the standing of each quote and the comparison that ranks them.

Those later rules read the comparison's own verdict out of the payload rather
than recomputing it. Two implementations of "could this quote be ranked?" would
eventually disagree, and the one nobody would re-check is the report.
