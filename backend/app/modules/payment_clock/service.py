"""Payment clock service - regimes, applications, notices and the register.

Stateless helpers over the four models. The statutory arithmetic itself is not
here: it lives in :mod:`app.modules.payment_clock.clock` as pure functions over
plain mappings, and this layer's job is to turn ORM rows into those mappings,
store what comes back, and keep the breach register in step with the findings.

Two decisions worth knowing before reading:

**The four dates are stored, not derived on read.** A statutory date is
evidence. It has to survive the regime catalogue being corrected next month,
and somebody asking what the deadline was wants the date the parties were
working to. :func:`recompute_schedule` is the only writer, and it refuses to
overwrite dates a person set by hand unless it is told to.

**The register mirrors the findings rather than reimplementing them.**
:func:`record_clock_events` takes the validation findings and files one row per
finding, keyed by rule and by what the finding was about, so the register and
the screen can never disagree about what the statute says happened.
