"""Construction-control deletion guards: evidence refuses to be deleted.

Every ``update_*`` in the module already refuses to edit a record the workflow has
locked. Not one ``delete_*`` refused anything, and because every cross-record link
in the module is a soft ``String(36)`` rather than a database foreign key,
PostgreSQL refused nothing either. A signed as-built, a released gate and an
issued completion certificate could all be removed outright, and an inspection
could be removed out from under the non-conformance report raised against it.

These tests pin both halves of the guard:

* **Locked by state** - a record acted on through the workflow refuses with 409.
* **Held by another record** - a record something still points at refuses with
  409 whose text names the holders by count and kind.

They also pin the negative: a draft nobody has touched still deletes cleanly, so
the guard does not turn the register read-only.
