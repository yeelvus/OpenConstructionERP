"""Resolving a seed row's party must fail to nothing, never to the wrong party.

Five registers link to a contact through ``_seeded_party_id``. The PG tests
prove the links reach the database; this pins the rule that decides what happens
when they cannot, which is the part a reader is most likely to 'tidy up'.

The registers seed more rows than there are firms with a contact. Falling back
to the first contact of the role would give every one of those rows a link, and
each would be wrong: a purchase order whose note names one company while its
vendor link points at another looks correct on every screen that shows it, and
nothing downstream can tell. An empty cell is visibly empty. So an index past
the end resolves to nothing on purpose, and this file is where that is written
down as a decision rather than an oversight.
