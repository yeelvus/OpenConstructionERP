"""A second home for modules, outside the source tree.

Modules that ship with the platform live in ``backend/app/modules``. Modules a
user installs at runtime must not, for two reasons that both bite in
production: a platform upgrade replaces the source tree and would take the
user's modules with it, and an operator running a packaged build has no source
tree to write into at all.

So installed modules live in the instance's own data directory, and this module
teaches the import system to look there as well.

The mechanism is the package ``__path__``. ``ModuleLoader`` imports modules by
package path (``importlib.import_module("app.modules.boq.manifest")``), so
appending the runtime directory to ``app.modules.__path__`` makes every
downstream consumer - the loader, the plugin manager, router mounting, Alembic
model discovery - find runtime modules with no change of their own.

Appended, never prepended. Import resolution walks ``__path__`` in order, so a
shipped module always wins a name collision and no installed package can
shadow ``app.modules.projects`` with its own. A collision is reported rather
than ignored, because the installed copy is then dead code that its author
believes is running.

Usage::

    from app.core.module_runtime_root import attach_runtime_root
    attach_runtime_root()          # once, at startup, before discover()
