"""Fail when an installed dependency carries copyleft we have not accepted.

Why this exists
---------------
The repository already had a licence gate, ``.github/workflows/dependency-review.yml``.
It never ran and would not have caught anything if it had. It triggers on
``pull_request``, and this project commits directly to ``main``, so the event
never occurs. Its denylist read ``GPL-2.0, GPL-3.0, LGPL-2.1, LGPL-3.0,
AGPL-1.0``: it denied AGPL-1.0, which nothing anywhere uses, and omitted
AGPL-3.0, which is the licence of the one genuinely AGPL package we ship. A
denylist that omits the licence it exists to catch is not a control.

That workflow has been corrected, but it still only runs on an event this
project does not produce, and it cannot be run locally at all: it needs the
GitHub dependency-review API and a pull-request diff. This script is the part
that can be run before a push, which is the only kind of check that catches
anything here.

What it inspects
----------------
The **Python environment it is executing in**, through ``importlib.metadata``.
For every installed distribution it reads the licence declared in that
distribution's own metadata: the PEP 639 ``License-Expression`` field, the
legacy ``License`` field, and the ``License :: ...`` trove classifiers. It
compares the result against the policy below.

Run it with the interpreter whose closure you care about::

    .venv-run/Scripts/python scripts/check_dependency_licences.py
    python scripts/check_dependency_licences.py --verbose

What it is blind to, stated so nobody over-reads a green run
------------------------------------------------------------
1. **Packages that are not installed here.** This measures one environment. A
   dependency reachable only through an extra that is not installed, or only on
   another platform, is invisible. ``--require`` asserts that a package we know
   ships in every artefact was actually seen, so a green run against an empty or
   half-built environment cannot pass silently.
2. **Native libraries compiled into a wheel.** A package declares a licence for
   its own source. The C libraries statically linked into its extension module
   arrive with the wheel and are described by no metadata anywhere. PyMuPDF is
   exactly this case: its entire in-wheel licence disclosure is one line, and
   MuPDF links further upstream code beneath it. ``NOTICE`` covers this layer by
   hand, under "Native Binaries Inside Python Wheels", because no scanner can.
3. **Metadata that disagrees with the shipped licence text.** We read the
   declaration, not the ``LICENSE`` file.
4. **The frontend and the Rust desktop shell.** Python only.

Exit codes
----------
0  every installed distribution is permissively licensed or explicitly accepted
1  a copyleft licence was found that is not on the accepted list
2  the environment could not be inspected, or a ``--require`` package is missing
