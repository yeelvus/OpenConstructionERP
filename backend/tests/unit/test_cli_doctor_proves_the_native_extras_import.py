"""The vector and encoder checks must import, not merely locate.

``find_spec`` resolves a module without executing it. That is the wrong
question for the two optional extras that are mostly compiled code: lancedb is
almost entirely one Rust library, and sentence-transformers imports torch, a
pile of native shared objects. Either can sit on disk, resolve perfectly, and
still fail to load.

This is not hypothetical. A frozen desktop build was measured reporting
"sentence-transformers installed" while carrying no torch at all, because the
check asked where the module was rather than whether it worked. The operator
reading that line has no way to tell a working install from a broken one, which
is the exact failure ``doctor`` exists to prevent.

The same lesson was already learned once in this file for the PDF readers. These
tests keep it from being unlearned for the other two.

Everything here runs with ``sys.frozen`` set, so the probe imports in-process
and no child interpreter is spawned. That keeps the tests hermetic and fast, and
it exercises the desktop branch, which is where the measured defect lived.
