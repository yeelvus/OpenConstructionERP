/**
 * PackEmblem — the mark that identifies a pack wherever a pack is shown.
 *
 * A country pack is identified by its country. It used to be identified by a
 * logo, and that logo was ours: we author these packs, so `us-texas` and
 * `brazil-sinapi` shipped a mark drawn in-house, which told a reader nothing
 * except that the pack existed. A flag answers the question the reader
 * actually has, which is "whose rules is this", and it answers it before the
 * name is read.
 *
 * The choice is made by the pack's own type rather than by a list kept here.
 * ``type === 'country'`` is inferred on the backend from country metadata and
 * already beats partner co-branding in that inference, so a partner pack
 * written for one country - a Canadian or a German one - is a country pack by
 * the system's own reckoning and gets its flag. A list in this file would be a
 * second register of the same fact and would drift from the first.
 *
 * A pack with no country to draw - an industry or cross-region pack, or a
 * country pack whose ISO code has no flag in the table - gets a monogram in
 * its own colours. It does not get its logo back. The packs ship wide wordmark
 * logos drawn for a co-brand strip, and one squeezed into a 48px square was an
 * illegible sliver that also flashed raw alt text on a slow first paint, so
 * the logo was never the better of the two even before the flags arrived.
 *
 * Sub-national packs are the case the flag alone cannot carry. California and
 * Texas both fly the same national flag, so the plate adds the subdivision
 * code beneath it. Drawing the state flags instead was the alternative and was
 * not taken: the Texas flag is two bands and a star, the California flag is a
 * bear, and a hand-reduced bear reads as a mistake rather than as a flag.
