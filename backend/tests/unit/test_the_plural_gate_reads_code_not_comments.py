"""The plural guard must take its call sites from code and not from prose.

``scripts/check_i18n_plural_forms.py`` excludes a key that is named literally
at a call site, on the sound reasoning that such a suffix belongs to the name
rather than to a plural. It found those names with a regex over
``frontend/src/**/*.ts*`` that did not know what a comment is, and a comment in
``pluralFormsAreChosenByI18nextNotByJavaScript.test.ts`` demonstrates the
anti-pattern that test forbids by writing two key names out in full. Both forms
of a complete key were therefore excluded from every locale at once, and the
guard reported 37 rows of a hole that does not exist. Each of the 37 was
checked against the locale file it named before this was written: every form
the guard called missing is present.

What makes that worth a test rather than a one-line fix is the direction the
repair can fail in. Blanking too little leaves today's noise, which is loud.
Blanking too much silently drops a real call site, the family disappears from
the counted population, and the guard stops asking about a key that genuinely
lacks a form. Nothing goes red in that case, and a guard that has gone quiet
looks exactly like a guard with nothing to report.

So the cases below come in opposed pairs. For every "a comment must not count"
there is a "code must still count", and the last pair is the one that catches
the obvious wrong implementation: a line comment stripped with a naive pattern
takes ``'https://example.test'`` for the start of a comment and swallows the
rest of the line, call site included.

The end to end pair does the same at the level of the verdict. One tree has a
real missing plural and must fail. The other has the complete key plus the
comment that used to break it and must pass. Before the repair the second tree
failed, which is the bug, and a repair that made the first tree pass would be
worse than the bug.
