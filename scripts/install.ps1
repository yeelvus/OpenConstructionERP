# OpenConstructionERP - One-Line Installer for Windows
#
# Usage:
#   irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datadrivenconstruction/OpenConstructionERP/main/scripts/install.ps1 | iex
#
# What it does:
#   1. If Docker Desktop is running → runs via docker compose
#   2. If Python 3.12+ is installed → installs via pip
#   3. Otherwise → installs uv → installs via uv

# Native commands (uv, python, docker) write progress to stderr by design.
# In Windows PowerShell 5.1, `$ErrorActionPreference = "Stop"` combined with
# `irm | iex` execution turns every stderr line into a NativeCommandError
# terminating exception — so a successful "Resolved 64 packages in 1.28s"
# from uv aborts the script before the install actually runs (issue #87).
# We rely on explicit `$LASTEXITCODE` checks after every native call instead.
$ErrorActionPreference = "Continue"

# Belt-and-braces for users on PowerShell 7.3+: also disable native-command
# error preference so `& uv ...` never escalates stderr to a terminating error.
