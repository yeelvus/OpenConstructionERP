// Cases <-> module route index.
//
// The project-journey map places every major module on the lifecycle line as a
// chip. This helper answers "which guided cases touch this module?" so the map
// can hang a small "N cases" affordance on a module chip and link into the case
// library. It is READ-ONLY over PLAYBOOKS: it never mutates the case registry,
// it only buckets playbooks by the app routes their steps visit.
//
// A case "touches" a module when one of its steps navigates to that module's
// route. Step routes may carry a `/projects/:projectId` prefix and/or a
// `?query`; both are normalised away with the SAME convention the runner uses
// (`resolveStepRoute` for the project prefix, then the query is dropped) so a
// step route and a journey module route compare as plain, unscoped bases such
// as `/boq` or `/portfolio`.

import { resolveStepRoute } from './progress';
import type { Playbook } from './types';

 * Normalise a route to the unscoped, query-less base used for matching.
 *
 * `/projects/:projectId/rfi` -> `/rfi`, `/takeoff?tab=measurements` ->
 * `/takeoff`, `/boq` -> `/boq`. Mirrors `resolveStepRoute(to, null)` (the
 * unscoped runner behaviour) and then strips any query so the base lines up
 * with a journey module route.

 * The distinct modules one case walks through, in the order its steps reach

 * Identity is the ROUTE, not the label, and that choice is load-bearing.
 * `types.ts` spends thirty lines on why `moduleLabel` and `moduleLabelKey` can
 * disagree and why a half-corrected pair reads in review as the fix working.
 * Deduplicating on the label inherits that: two steps that visit `/files` with
 * the labels "Files" and "Documents" would count as two modules and draw two
 * cells for one place. Two steps that visit different routes under a
 * copy-pasted label would collapse into one. Routes cannot drift that way -
 * they are what the runner navigates to.
 *
 * The label pair still comes from the first step at that route, so a cell says
 * the same word its step chip says, in every language.
