# DDC-CWICR-OE: DataDrivenConstruction - OpenConstructionERP
"""Documents demo seed - a project document register backed by real files.

What the file manager calls a folder
------------------------------------
``/files`` builds its left pane from one node per *file kind* - documents,
photos, sheets, BIM models, DWG drawings, takeoffs, reports, markups - and the
documents table tracks no sub-folder path of its own (``kind_and_path_for_document``
in ``folder_permissions_service`` states this outright). Inside the document
kind the folder is therefore the ``category`` column, and that column has a
fixed vocabulary: drawing, contract, specification, photo, correspondence,
reality_capture, other. So "a folder structure a construction project would
actually have" means coverage across those categories, plus the ISO 19650
revision chain the columns already carry - not a nested tree, which the storage
layer cannot express.

Real bytes, real sizes
----------------------
The file manager reports ``Document.file_size`` when it is non-zero and only
falls back to ``os.stat``. A row with an invented size and a path pointing at
nothing therefore shows a plausible size next to a download that 404s. Every
document written here is a file that exists: the committed reference PDFs are
copied into the same store an upload writes to, the narrative documents are
authored as real PDFs, and ``file_size`` is read back off the file on disk.
A document whose bytes cannot be produced is not written at all.

``photo`` and ``reality_capture`` are deliberately left empty. Photos are their
own file kind (and the documents service already cross-links a photo row to a
document row by shared path, so a seeded photo-category document would double up
in the tree); reality capture means scan data, and there is no scan asset to
stand behind such a row.

Idempotent per project on this seeder's own marker. A plain "the project has no
documents" test would never fire, because the demo install already writes a
handful of document rows before this ever runs.

    revision that changed nothing. The top-up therefore removes it instead of
    leaving it beside a chain that does the same job honestly.

    Deliberately narrow. Only rows this seeder wrote are touched, matched on
    its own marker and on the sheet number, never on a name a user could have
    typed. Only called once the German chain is confirmed on the project, so a
    register can never end up with neither chain. And a row some takeoff
    document was opened from is left alone: takeoff keeps its source as a plain
    id column with no foreign key behind it, so deleting underneath one would
    strand the measurements filed against it with nothing failing to say so.

    The files stay on disk. Each project is seeded inside a SAVEPOINT that can
    still roll back after this runs, and a surviving row whose bytes were
    deleted is a broken register, while two orphaned demo PDFs cost nothing.
