"""Removal verbs for a purchase order: cancel (void) and delete.

A purchase order is a commercial document, so "get rid of it" is three
different operations depending on what the document has already done:

* a ``draft`` PO that never left ``draft`` and that nothing points at may be
  deleted outright - budget commits at ``approved``, so a PO that was never
  approved has no finance marker to compensate and no number a supplier has
  seen;
* a PO that has been approved or issued must be CANCELLED, which keeps the
  row and its ``po_number`` and flips the status to ``cancelled``;
* a PO that goods receipts, retainage releases, payable invoices or
  requisitions point at is refused with 409, naming every holder by kind and
  count, because destroying it would take an audit trail with it.

The same holder guard has to sit behind every door into ``cancelled``. There
are two: the dedicated ``cancel_po`` verb and a PATCH that sets
``status="cancelled"``. A guard on only one of them is bypassable, which is
the failure mode the module already documented for the two doors into
``approved``.

Repositories are stubbed, mirroring ``test_procurement_data_integrity.py``.
