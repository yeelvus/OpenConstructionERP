// Case: "Value the month and certify the progress payment" (CN).
//
// The monthly cycle on a Chinese project: the work is inspected and accepted,
// the period is valued against the contract's schedule of values, retention is
// held, the supervising side certifies, and the certified amount becomes a
// payable. The engine underneath is country-neutral - nothing on this screen is
// an American or a British form - so the case is about running the Chinese
// ritual through it rather than about a national layout.
//
// The last step is the one with real statutory content. The payment clock
// carries two Chinese regimes from the SME payment regulation: thirty calendar
// days where the buyer is a government organ or a public institution, sixty
// where it is a large enterprise, both owed to a small or medium-sized supplier.
// For a progress claim the clock runs from the date the parties confirmed the
// settlement amount, so that is the date to put on the application. Content
// strings are key plus inline English default and live only here.

    "The monthly application is where a construction business either has cash or does not, and it fails in two ordinary ways: the percentages are typed from memory rather than taken from the site, and certification is a formality performed by the same person who prepared the claim. This case closes both. The valuation is pulled from progress that was recorded against accepted work, so the number answers to something; certification is a separate act under a separate permission, which is the structural half of the supervising engineer's signature; and the certified amount reaches finance as a payable without being re-entered. It ends on the payment clock because a due date nobody computed is a due date nobody can enforce, and because the Chinese regime that applies depends on who the buyer is rather than on what the contract says.",
