"""Every rule set a module asks the engine for must resolve to real rules.

A rule set is a name, and nothing checks that the name means anything. Rules
register into the set named by their ``standard`` unless the registration
passes an explicit list, so renaming a constant, or writing a rule whose
``standard`` does not match the set its module requests, leaves the module
calling ``validate(rule_sets=["something"])`` against an empty set. The call
succeeds. The report comes back clean. Nothing ran.

That is not hypothetical: three ``ai_takeoff`` rules shipped with full i18n
messages in three languages and never executed once, because no caller ever
passed that set name. The rules were eventually deleted, but the shape that
hid them is still here, and it is invisible to every other kind of test. A
behaviour test for a dormant rule passes by asserting the absence of a
finding, which is exactly what a dormant rule produces.

Registration happens along two routes and the check has to know both, or it
reports its own blind spot as a defect. Core rules land in the registry when
``register_builtin_rules`` runs. Module rules land when the module loader
awaits that package's ``on_startup`` hook, which no test process does. So the
first route is checked by asking the live registry and the second by reading
the source: a set counts as reachable if some module registers into it and the
package exposes the startup hook that performs the registration.

These tests live in the PG lane because that lane is a merge gate and the
default unit lane is not. The check itself needs no database.

# That population is green and it excludes the place this defect actually
# shipped from. A demo template declares its rule sets as a plain list literal
# in ``app/core``, never touches the constant convention, and is what the
# product reads when it seeds a project: ``demo_projects.py`` writes
# ``template.validation_rule_sets`` onto the project row and seeds the first
# validation report from the same list. So the name a demo carries is the name
# a user's dashboard runs, and nothing checked it.
#
# It was wrong. Both Hungarian demos asked for ``tetelrend``, which is the
# classification standard, not a rule set; the Hungarian rules register under
# ``hungary``. The engine logs an unimplemented rule set and continues, so two
# country demos ran the generic quality rules and none of their country's own,
# including the material and fee split that is the one thing every Hungarian
# bill is quoted in. Nothing was red anywhere.
#
# The reader below takes both syntactic forms on purpose. Eight of the forty
# nine declaration sites write the dict form, ``"validation_rule_sets": [...]``,
# rather than the keyword form, and a reader shaped like one of them is blind
# to the other. That is the same mistake this file already records against
# itself higher up, and repeating it here would have hidden the seed scripts.
