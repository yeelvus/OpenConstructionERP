"""Pure computation core for the construction interface register.

On any multi-package or multi-contractor job the real risk is not inside a work
package but between them: the handshakes where one party's work meets another's -
a duct that must pass through a structural opening, a power supply another trade
depends on, a contractual scope boundary, a shared piece of ground. Each such
handshake is an "interface": it has an owner (the party responsible for getting
it agreed), an accepter (the party that depends on it), a date it must be agreed
by, and a status running from identified to closed (with disputed and on_hold as
side states). The actions needed to close each interface are tracked alongside.

This module turns a flat list of interfaces (each with a status, a priority, a
type, an owning and accepting party, the originating work package, key dates and
its actions) into the numbers a coordinator needs: how the register splits by
status, priority and type; which interfaces are overdue (past their need-by date
and not yet settled) or in dispute; how much of the register is agreed; the open
action load; a per-work-package health view; and a single overall health score.

Everything here is a plain value object plus a set of functions. It is
``Decimal``-exact for every percentage it reports and carries no ORM, database,
FastAPI or Pydantic dependency, exactly like
:mod:`app.modules.temporary_works.register` and
:mod:`app.modules.site_prep.readiness`, so the whole core is trivially
constructed and asserted from plain values. The DB loaders that build
:class:`InterfaceRow` lists live in
:mod:`app.modules.interface_management.service`.

Guard convention: every percentage is guarded and returns ``None`` (never raises,
never a silent zero) when the base is zero - an empty register reads "undefined"
rather than "0 percent agreed" or "0 percent healthy".

Vocabulary convention: an unknown status, priority or type value never raises
here; it simply fails to match a bucket or a settled-state check, so a stray row
can never poison a whole-register rollup or make an interface look agreed.
