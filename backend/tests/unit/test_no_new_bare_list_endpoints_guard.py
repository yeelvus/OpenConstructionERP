"""The guard that stops the tree adding bare-list endpoints faster than waves remove them.

The pagination programme had a metering problem rather than an effort problem.
Each wave migrated a batch of registers from ``list[...]`` to ``{items, total,
offset, limit}`` and counted them, and nothing counted the routes arriving in
new modules meanwhile. The census fell from 516 to 496 across one wave, which
looks like progress and would look identical if forty had been migrated and
twenty added. ``scripts/check_no_new_bare_list_endpoints.py`` closes that by
naming every bare-list route that existed when it was written, so the count is
a fact rather than a claim.

What is worth testing here is not that it finds a list annotation. It is the
four shapes around the edge that decide whether the guard is usable at all.

A writer that returns rows is not a truncated read. ``POST /things/`` answering
with the created rows tells nobody anything about a register, and a guard that
flagged it would push authors into wrapping creates in an envelope for no
reason. Only ``get`` is examined.

A single-item read is not a list. ``GET /things/{id}`` returning one row shares
a router and a file with the register beside it, and both are matched by any
scan looking for routes rather than for shapes.

An entry that no longer names a live route is a failure, not a leftover. This
is the one deliberate piece of friction: the allowlist is also the census, and
a census that keeps entries it has outgrown stops counting anything. Worse, the
freed name silently re-permits whatever route later takes it, which is the
failure mode the guard exists to prevent, arriving through the guard's own
front door.

The scanner is asserted against the live tree at the end, because a guard whose
own self-test passes while its scan reads nothing is the exact shape of a
gate that has quietly stopped working.
