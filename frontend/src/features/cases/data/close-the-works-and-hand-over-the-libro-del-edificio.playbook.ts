// Case: "Close the works and hand over the libro del edificio" (ES).
//
// The Spanish end of a building job is one chain of dated acts: the direccion
// facultativa signs the certificado final de obra, the acta de recepcion is
// signed with or without reservas, the guarantee periods of the Ley de
// Ordenacion de la Edificacion run from that date, and the libro del edificio
// is handed to the owner with the instructions they will actually operate from.
//
// The warranty register ships two statutory limitation regimes and both are
// German, so there is no Spanish preset to pick. The module is built for that:
// an entry with no regime derives nothing and rewrites nothing, and the agreed
// period is entered by hand. The case says so rather than implying a preset.
// Content strings are key plus inline English default and live only here.

    "Everything at the Spanish end of a job hangs off one date. The certificado final de obra is signed by both members of the direccion facultativa, the acta de recepcion follows it, and from the recepcion the guarantee periods run: one year for defects in the finishes, three for those affecting habitability, ten for those touching structure. The libro del edificio is delivered to the owner and it is not a formality, because it is the document the community will still be reading in fifteen years when a facade repair has to be justified. Two things are worth doing deliberately. Write the reservas into the acta instead of agreeing them in the room, because an acta with reservas suspends nothing except the parts it names. And enter the guarantee periods as dated entries rather than trusting anybody to remember which of the three applies, since the register ships no Spanish regime and will not invent one for you.",
