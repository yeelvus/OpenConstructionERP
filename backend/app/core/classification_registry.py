"""The one place that turns a project's region into a classification standard.

Before this module the tree carried six hand-kept copies of the same
mapping: two tables plus a fallback table in the match pipeline, one in
the validation rules, one declared per row on the shipped CWICR
catalogues, and one keyed by region inside the BOQ rule-set builder. The
copies had drifted, and the drift was not academic. Australia, India and
South Africa were ranked against NRM by the match pipeline and against
MasterFormat by the catalogue the product ships for them; Brazil,
Morocco and Tunisia disagreed the other way round.

Worse, resolution depended on the *shape* of the region string rather
than its meaning. ``PL`` resolved to DIN 276 and ``PL_WARSAW`` to
MasterFormat, because the catalogue loop pre-loaded every catalogue
region id into the lookup with a default standard, which meant the
city-suffix safety net (``if head is None and "_" in region``) could
never fire for the very ids that needed it. Sixteen countries answered
two different ways depending on whether a city happened to be appended.

The shape of the fix:

* :data:`COUNTRY_TO_STANDARD` is the only table. It is keyed by ISO
  3166-1 alpha-2 and nothing else, so a country cannot be listed twice
  under two spellings.
* :func:`normalise_region` reduces any region string to that alpha-2
  code once, before any lookup happens. A catalogue region id resolves
  through the ``country_iso`` the catalogue *declares*, not through
  string surgery on the id - ``SV_STOCKHOLM`` is Sweden, ``ZH_CHINA``
  is China and ``VI_HANOI`` is Vietnam, none of which survive splitting
  on the underscore.
* Resolution is total. It never raises, because it runs on the BOQ
  section-path render path where an exception would trade a wrong
  standard for a broken page. It reports instead: every answer carries
  the country it matched and whether it matched at all.

When a region resolves to nothing the answer is
:data:`DEFAULT_CLASSIFICATION_STANDARD` with ``source="default"``, and
the fall-through is logged rather than swallowed. A blank region is the
schema default for ``ProjectCreate`` and is expected, so it logs at info;
a region that was filled in and still did not resolve is a data problem
and logs at warning. Both are deduplicated per process so a per-row
render path cannot flood the log.

Rule packs are a different axis and keep their own table. A country
picks one classification standard but can pull several validation rule
packs (Spain reads BC3 and MasterFormat, Germany reads GAEB and DIN
276), so folding the two together would lose information. What they
share is this module's normaliser, which is the part that was wrong.
