"""The gate that keeps the registered sign on a CAD tool named in a UI string.

The founder ruling of 2026-08-14 allows the authoring tool the converter reads
from to be named in UI strings, on the condition that the first mention in each
string carries the registered sign. ``scripts/check_no_brand_tokens.py`` grew a
second, hash-free check for that, and the interesting part is not that it finds
an unmarked name. It is the three shapes it must not get wrong.

A second mention inside the same string stays bare. "Revit templates read Revit
parameters" is correct trademark usage, so a check written per occurrence would
reject the exact wording the ruling produced and push an author into marking
every repetition.

A following hyphen is not an exemption. German, Dutch and the Nordic locales
compound the name into the next word, so the string reads Revit-Modelle, and the
sign belongs on the name itself: Revit(R)-Modelle. The earlier marketing script
skipped hyphenated forms because it was avoiding a repository slug, and carrying
that rule over here would decline to check roughly a third of the locales while
reporting green on them. Those are the locales where the mention is most likely
to be reintroduced by a translation pass, so the blind spot would sit exactly
where the risk is.

The repository slug is genuinely exempt. ``cad2data-Revit-IFC-DWG-DGN`` is part
of a URL that has to stay byte-exact, and marking it would break the link. The
exemption is anchored on that prefix rather than on looking slug-shaped, so a
new slug is reported rather than quietly permitted.

Locale files are not the whole UI. English also ships as i18n defaults written
into components, and ``guide.eac.selectors.body`` has no entry in any of the
forty locales, so its default is the only English that string will ever render.
A gate scoped to locale files reports green over exactly that. The second scan
therefore reads default-shaped lines anywhere under ``frontend/src``, and its
own risk is the opposite one: shouting at an identifier or a comment would get
the gate switched off, so those shapes are tested as hard as the findings are.

The live tree is asserted here on purpose, unlike the version-sync gate, which
leaves that to its CI job. The brand script runs in ``Brand Token Check``, a job
whose own workflow file carries the chronically red frontend build, whereas this
file runs under ``CI (PostgreSQL)``. Asserting the tree here is what makes the
ruling enforced rather than merely reported.
