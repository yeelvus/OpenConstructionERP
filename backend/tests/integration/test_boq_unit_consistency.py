"""Integration test: BOQUnitSystemConsistencyRule fires WARNING for mismatched units.

Wave 24 (#167) — task: seed an imperial project, create a BOQ position with a
metric unit, assert the validation rule fires a WARNING.

Repointed at the shipped mechanism. The first test used to create a project
with ``unit_system='imperial'`` and assert the API echoed it back. No such
field was ever implemented — not on the model, not in the schema — so the
assertion could not pass, and the test then went on to validate a hand-built
context that ignored the project and BOQ it had just created. It proved the
rule could be called, not that anything reaches it.

The unit system now comes from the project's regional pack: the project
carries ``country_code``, ``app.core.regional_packs`` resolves that to the
pack claiming the country, and the pack's declared ``measurement_system``
becomes ``project_unit_system`` for the run. So the imperial project below is
created by setting ``country_code='US'`` — us_pack declares imperial — and the
assertion runs through ``POST /validation/run/`` against the stored BOQ rather
than against a dict written in the test. The behaviour being asserted is
unchanged: a metric unit in an imperial project is exactly one WARNING, not an
ERROR and not a pass.

Open question, deliberately not settled here: whether a project should also be
able to override its pack's measurement system directly. The abandoned
``unit_system`` field was that design. Repointing these tests at the pack is
not a decision against the override — it is only a statement of what ships
today. If a per-project override lands later, this file is where its
precedence over the pack belongs.

Pattern mirrors test_boq_bim_qty_source_roundtrip.py: register + promote +
login + project + BOQ + position + validate.
