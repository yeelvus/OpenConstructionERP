"""DB-backed tests for which bill an approved change order is written into.

The target used to be "the project's oldest unlocked BOQ", picked by
``created_at`` and recorded only in a log line. No caller passes ``boq_id``,
so that guess was the live default rather than a rare fallback: on a project
holding two unlocked bills it wrote real money into a bill nobody named, and
the read-only preview ran its own copy of the same query, so it agreed with
the wrong answer instead of exposing it.

The rule is now about ambiguity: one candidate is an answer, several
candidates are a question, and a question is refused. The refusal belongs to
the approval, not only to the writeback - ``approve_order`` returns early on
an order that is already approved and ``_apply_to_boq`` has exactly one call
site inside it, so an approval that lands without placing its scope can never
place it afterwards. Refusing costs a retry; reporting would cost a permanent
gap between the budget and the bills.

These tests run against a real PostgreSQL database rather than a stubbed
session, because the claim under test is that the *query* is right - a stub
would only re-state the service's own branching back at it. The last section
drives the HTTP endpoint instead, because the claim there is that the refusal
is visible from outside the module.

Every case seeds ``ChangeOrderItem`` rows unless it says otherwise:
``_apply_to_boq`` returns ``no_items`` before it ever consults the resolver,
so an item-less change order would "refuse" for a reason that has nothing to
do with the target. The one case that seeds none asserts exactly that.
