"""Email service facade - the public seam the rest of the app talks to.

Responsibilities:

* Pick the right backend based on ``Settings.email_backend``.
* Provide high-level, typed helpers (``send_password_reset``, …) so
  call sites never assemble raw ``EmailMessage`` objects or worry about
  template subjects.
* Log every attempt at INFO with structured fields for observability.
* Memoise the backend per ``Settings`` instance so production workloads
  do not re-create SMTP clients on every send.

Testing hook: ``get_email_service(backend=...)`` accepts an explicit
backend instance, letting tests inject a ``MemoryEmailBackend`` without
monkey-patching settings.

Why a facade instead of passing the backend directly?  Call sites
outnumber backends roughly 20:1 - keeping a single ``get_email_service``
entry point means adding a new provider (SES, SendGrid) is a two-file
change (``base.py`` + the new backend) rather than a sweep across
modules/users, modules/integrations, and any future consumer.
