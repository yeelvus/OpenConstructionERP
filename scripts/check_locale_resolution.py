"""LOCK: a catalogue must answer a regional locale the same way it answers its base language.

THIS IS A REGRESSION LOCK, NOT A BUG REPORT, and the distinction is the first
thing a reader deserves. It was written after measuring whether the defect it
guards is live today. It is not. Everything below is what that measurement
found, so that the next person can re-run it rather than re-trust it.

THE DEFECT. A catalogue keyed by base language (``de``, ``ru``, ``es``) that
looks a locale up by exact string match does not fail when handed ``de-AT``.
It misses the dict and silently answers in English, which on screen is
indistinguishable from a language nobody has translated yet. ``341d37ca7``
fixed three catalogues carrying it: ``modules/requirements/intl.py``,
``modules/risk/intl.py``, and ``modules/bcf/messages/``.

WHY IT IS NOT LIVE, measured rather than assumed. A regional code cannot reach
a catalogue through any production path that exists today:

  * The context path is clamped twice. ``AcceptLanguageMiddleware._resolve_locale``
    matches an incoming tag against ``SUPPORTED_LOCALES``, which holds base
    codes only, by exact-or-prefix match; and ``set_locale`` then stores
    ``resolve_locale(locale) or "en"`` rather than the code it was handed. So
    ``get_locale()`` cannot return a regional code, and every catalogue fed
    from it - which includes all seven ``MessageBundle`` catalogues and bcf's
    ``_locale_of`` - receives a base language or English.
  * The document path strips explicitly. ``resolve_document_locale`` takes the
    client-controlled ``?locale=`` value and the raw ``Accept-Language``
    header and reduces both with ``.split("-")[0]`` before matching.
  * The lookups that DO still resolve by exact match are all defended, but in
    two different ways, and the second is the one that makes this lock worth
    having. The baseline holds them; they fall into:

    - UNREACHABLE. Twelve of the sixteen have no production reference at
      all: their defining module and their own unit test, nothing else. No
      router, no service, no sibling module, so no request can reach them.
      ``reporting.intl.label`` has no reference anywhere, test included.
      Resolved by IMPORT rather than by name, over all 4307 files under
      ``backend/app`` and ``backend/tests``: collect what each file imports
      from a baseline module, both plain ``from M import name`` and ``from P
      import M`` followed by ``M.name``, then match references against that.
      A name grep was tried first and rejected as unusable, which is worth
      recording because it is the more obvious method: ``label`` alone
      returned 241 hits, nearly all SQLAlchemy ``func.count().label(...)``,
      and ``changeorders/intl.py`` defines its own ``status_label``, which a
      name grep happily attributes to ``daily_diary``. Both errors inflate
      the reachable set, so a grep cannot support a claim of UNreachability.
    - REACHED, BUT ONLY EVER WITH A STRIPPED CODE. The other four. ``report_translations``'s
      ``field_label`` and ``section_title`` and ``daily_diary``'s
      ``pdf_translations`` lookups are called from real export paths
      (``reporting/exporters.py``, ``reporting/renderer.py``,
      ``daily_diary/pdf_export.py``). They are safe only because every route
      that reaches them resolves the locale through ``resolve_report_locale``
      or ``resolve_pdf_locale`` first, both thin wrappers over
      ``resolve_document_locale``, which strips. The catalogue does not defend
      itself; its callers defend it.

So the failure mode is real, the code that carries it is real, and nothing can
currently trigger it. That second class is exactly why this is a lock and not
a curiosity: the invariant rests on a discipline at every call site, and one
new call site that forwards a raw ``?locale=`` value into ``field_label``
makes it live with no other change. The lock fires when someone does that,
when a regional code is added to ``SUPPORTED_LOCALES``, or when a new
catalogue resolves by exact match.

BEHAVIOURAL, NOT STRUCTURAL, and this was a deliberate choice. Five different
spellings of "strip the region" are already in the tree - ``_norm_lang``,
``_normalize_locale``, ``_lang_key``, ``lang.lower().startswith(...)``, and
``locale_candidates`` - so a source scan looking for a recognised idiom would
report a catalogue as broken for using a sixth. This asks the catalogue
instead: call the same function twice, once as ``de`` and once as ``de-AT``,
and require the same answer. A catalogue cannot pass that by accident and
cannot fail it for a spelling nobody anticipated.

WHAT IT DOES NOT COVER, since a lock that overstates its reach is worse than
none. Only catalogues it can import and demonstrate are counted, and the
report prints that number rather than the number scanned, because the count
that can narrow silently is the one worth printing. A module whose table holds
no non-English string different from its English one cannot demonstrate the
defect either way and is reported as not-demonstrable rather than as a pass;
``compliance_ai`` is such a case today, legitimately - its catalogue is two
keys, ``OK`` and a product name, which are the same in both languages. This
lock also says nothing about whether a translation is complete or correct;
``scripts/check_validation_message_locale_coverage.py`` counts breadth and is
equally blind to depth.
