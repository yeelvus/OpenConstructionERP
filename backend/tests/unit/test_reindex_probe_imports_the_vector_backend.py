"""The reindex probe must import the backend, not merely locate it.

``find_spec`` resolves a module without executing it. lancedb is almost
entirely one Rust extension, so it can sit on disk, resolve perfectly, and
still fail to load. A build in that state passed the old probe and then failed
inside the reindex, which turns a clean 503 naming the fault into a 500 that
names nothing.

The same blind spot was closed in ``doctor`` first. This is the copy that
answers a user rather than an operator, which is the reason it matters more
here: the operator can read a stack trace, and the user gets whatever this
message says.
