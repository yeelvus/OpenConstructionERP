 * check-case-coverage.mjs
 *
 * Finds case strings that were never translated, and stops that number
 * growing without anyone saying so.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 *
 * A playbook under src/features/cases/data names every string it renders
 * by key and carries the English inline as a *Default field, so a key no
 * locale answers renders English in that locale, in that locale only, and
 * nothing looks wrong to the person who added the case. No other gate can
 * see it. check_i18n_orphan_keys.py reads literal t('...') calls, and at
 * these call sites the key is a variable off a data row.
 * check-case-translation-drift.mjs reports a translation whose English
 * moved and deliberately skips a key that was never translated, because
 * a translation that does not exist cannot have gone stale.
 * check_case_playbook_catalogue_locales.py holds the finished languages to
 * the catalogue text, which is the title, the one-line description and
 * the long description. Nobody owned the step text, and that is where the
 * gap lives: measured on 2026-09-06, 220 playbooks name 7037 keys and most
 * offered locales lack about 3000 of them, a number that grew with every
 * new case because nothing could see it grow.
 *
 * HOW IT WORKS
 *
 * Every playbook is read for the keys it names (titleKey, descKey,
 * longDescKey, whatKey, whyKey, labelKey, inputsHintKey, outputsHintKey),
 * every locale file for the cases.* keys it defines, and each offered
 * locale gets a count of what it does not answer. A manifest records
 * those counts, per locale and per playbook, and the check fails when any
 * count is HIGHER than recorded: a key a locale had and lost, or a case
 * that shipped without its strings. Lower is always fine, and --update
 * records the lower numbers. It will not record a higher one, so the
 * manifest is a floor that only moves down, and taking on new debt has to
 * be a hand edit that shows in the diff.
 *
 * Per playbook and not per locale, because a total nets out. A locale that
 * gained 30 keys on one case and lost 30 on another shows the same total,
 * and the case that lost them renders English with nothing to say so. Per
 * key would be exact and is not affordable, roughly 120,000 entries today.
 * A playbook is the unit a translator works in and the unit a case ships
 * in, so it is the grain at which a regression has a name.
 *
 * THE FLOOR IS MEASURED FROM A COMMIT, NEVER FROM THE WORKING TREE
 *
 * The first floor was written from a checkout that also held Russian and
 * Chinese case translations nobody had committed, about 626 lines in each
 * file. It recorded fifteen playbooks as answered in ru and zh while the
 * committed files answered none of them, and the gate then failed every
 * push on main for a regression that had never happened: the tree it
 * measured and the tree it guards were two different things. So --update
 * reads the playbooks, the locale files and SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES out of a
 * commit (HEAD unless --from-git names another) and writes that commit's
 * hash into the manifest as measured_at. What is on disk cannot reach the
 * floor, there is no flag that lets it, and anyone can re-derive the
 * numbers from the hash. The check itself still reads the working tree,
 * because that is what a developer wants to know before committing and
 * because in CI the working tree is the commit; when the two differ it
 * says so and names the files.
 *
 * Regional variants are counted through their base language. es-MX,
 * es-CL, es-CO and pt-BR fall back to es and pt before English
 * (fallbackLng in src/app/i18n.ts), and the chip and orphan guards apply
 * the same rule, so a key those files do not carry renders the base
 * translation and is not a gap. The file-only figure is printed beside it
 * for anyone measuring what the regional file itself holds.
 *
 * en is the source, its English lives in the playbooks and not in en.ts,
 * so it is not counted; en-GB and en-US are overlays over en and are not
 * counted either; a locale file that is not in SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES is reported
 * and not gated, because nothing loads it.
 *
 * card_complete is the list of base locales whose catalogue text is
 * complete for every playbook: title, description, and long description
 * where the English has one. --update promotes a locale into it the day
 * it gets there and never takes one out.
 * check_case_playbook_catalogue_locales.py reads that list, so the
 * finished languages are named in one place.
 *
 * What it cannot see: a key whose value is a copy of the English. That
 * renders exactly like a missing one and belongs to
 * check_locale_english_placeholder.py and check-locale-render.mjs.
 * Presence is what is measured here. The gate this extends is described
 * in docs/strategy/I18N_NAMESPACE_GAP_CENSUS.md under "Suggested gates".
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node frontend/scripts/check-case-coverage.mjs
 *   node frontend/scripts/check-case-coverage.mjs --update
 *   node frontend/scripts/check-case-coverage.mjs --selftest
 *
 *   --update              measure HEAD, record the current, lower numbers
 *                         and promote a locale that reached full catalogue
 *                         coverage. Refuses to raise a number or demote a
 *                         locale. Never reads the working tree.
 *   --from-git <ref>      measure that commit instead of HEAD (--update) or
 *                         instead of the working tree (check, --json)
 *   --selftest            prove the check can fail, on data built to fail,
 *                         and that --update cannot see the working tree
 *   --json                print the measurement as JSON instead of a table
 *   --data-dir <dir>      check only: read playbooks from here
 *   --locales-dir <dir>   check only: read locale files from here
 *   --manifest <file>     read and write this manifest instead of the tree's
 *   The directory overrides exist so a regression can be staged in a
 *   scratch copy and shown to fail without touching the tree. They are
 *   refused with --update, which measures a commit and nothing else.
