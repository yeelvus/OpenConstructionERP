/**
 * #200 — nine keys whose value was assembled by a JS template literal before
 * i18next ever saw it.
 *
 * `t('gaeb.import_btn', { defaultValue: `Import ${n} positions` })` hands
 * i18next one finished English sentence. There is no variable for a translator
 * to move, so no locale file can put the number where its own grammar puts it,
 * and a language that inflects the noun after a numeral cannot be written at
 * all. The count has to arrive as an interpolation variable and the default has
 * to keep a literal `{{count}}` for the locale files to mirror.
 *
 * This is asserted against the OPTIONS OBJECT, not against rendered output.
 * Rendering cannot tell the two apart: "Import 5 positions" is what you get
 * whether the 5 was substituted by i18next or baked in by the template literal
 * before the call. The source is the only place the difference is visible.
 *
 * Scoped to the four files #200 covers. A tree-wide version is not possible
 * yet — 23 further call sites across 14 other files still build a defaultValue
 * from a template literal, and they need the same treatment before this can be
 * turned on everywhere.
