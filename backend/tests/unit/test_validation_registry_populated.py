"""The validation registry must be populated before a test runs, not after it.

``register_builtin_rules()`` is called by the application lifespan, which no test
process starts. The autouse guard in ``conftest`` used to repopulate the registry
only in its teardown, so the *first* test in a process to ask for a rule set found
an empty registry. The engine answers that by marking the set unsupported and
returning a clean report, which reads exactly like "my rule passed" and is really
"nothing ran at all".

This file is the reachability gate for that. Run it on its own and it is the first
test in the process, which is the condition the bug needed:
