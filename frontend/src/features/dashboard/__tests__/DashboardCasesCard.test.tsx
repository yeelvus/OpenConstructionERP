/**
 * The cases block on the dashboard: the size it comes at, the way back out of
 * it, and the one contract it used to break.
 *
 * WHY A WAY OUT IS TESTED AT ALL. The block was made several times larger on
 * purpose. A block that grows and cannot be put back is worse than the small
 * one it replaced, so the controls that shrink and hide it are part of the
 * feature, not decoration on it - and they are only worth anything if they
 * write the preference the DASHBOARD already keeps. A private flag would look
 * identical on screen and be invisible to Customize, which is where a user who
 * hid the card goes looking for it. So these assert the store, not the click.
 *
 * WHY THE COUNTS ARE TESTED. The block is two rows: eleven cases and the tile
 * that opens the rest of the library, six across on a wide screen. Two rows is
 * a joint property of the count and the column class, and neither half is
 * visible from the other, so both are asserted together. The ladder across the
 * four widths is asserted as well, because the failure a count fixed at full
 * width alone would ship is a card that GROWS when you press "smaller".
 *
 * WHY THE FACES ARE TESTED. `dealCaseFaces` documents that it must be dealt
 * over the WHOLE catalogue: the person a case wears is a property of where the
 * case sits among all cases, so a narrowed or windowed list must not re-cast
 * it. This card dealt over its own ranked window, which is exactly the thing
 * the helper warns against - the ranking reorders, so a case wore one person
 * here and a different one on the hub. The last test pins the fix with the
 * ranking deliberately reordered, because in catalogue order the bug and the
 * fix agree.
 *
 * Run: npx vitest run src/features/dashboard/__tests__/DashboardCasesCard.test.tsx
