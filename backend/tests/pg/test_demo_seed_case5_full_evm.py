"""The seeded baseline must be a plan the earned-value screen can measure against.

Two steps of the cost-control walkthrough land on this screen, the one that
freezes the plan and the one that reads the forecast, and the module shipped
with no seeder, so both opened on "this project has no baseline".

Filling the table is the easy half. The half that matters is that the numbers
close: a curve that is cumulative rather than per-period, a budget that is the
cost side of the bill rather than the bill itself, indices that follow from the
observations rather than being asserted next to them, and an actual cost that
is the same money the reconciliation screen shows one click earlier. Each of
those is a way to fill the screen and still be wrong.

Against a real PostgreSQL schema: the baseline carries a unique constraint on
(project_id, name) and the measures one on (baseline_id, data_date), so the
guard that stops a re-run doubling the register is what a version upgrade
would otherwise turn into a failed transaction.
