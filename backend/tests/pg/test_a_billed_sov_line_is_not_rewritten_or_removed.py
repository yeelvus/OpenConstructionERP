"""A schedule of values line a claim has billed on stays as it was billed.

``ProgressClaimLine.contract_line_id`` is declared ``ondelete="CASCADE"`` and
has no ORM relationship, so the database is the only actor when a schedule
line goes: every claim line that billed against it is deleted with it. The
claim keeps its gross, retention and net due, and the breakdown that explains
them is gone, including on a claim that was certified and paid.

The guard in front of this used to be about the contract only. Line edits are
refused once the contract is signed, and a draft contract edits its schedule
freely, which is right while nothing has been billed. Nothing ties a claim to
the contract's status, though, so a draft contract can carry claims, and then
a delete destroyed their lines and a rate edit restated the value under a
certificate already issued. Whether a line may change is a fact about the
line, so the second guard asks the line.

This lives in the PG lane on purpose. The cascade is a PostgreSQL fact; SQLite
without its foreign key pragma leaves the claim line behind as an orphan
instead, and a test there would pass for the wrong reason.

Every read-back below is a fresh SELECT rather than ``session.get``. The
identity map would hand back the claim line still cached in memory after the
database had already cascaded it away, and the assertion would pass on the
very defect it is here to catch.
