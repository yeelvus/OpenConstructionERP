"""The set of rate lines the supersede repair will rewrite is pinned, not merely derived.

Why this file exists at all
---------------------------
``tax_window_supersede`` derives its population from
``tax_configurations.json`` rather than naming a country, which is the whole
argument for it being general: the next time a legislature changes a rate, the
window goes in the seed file and the repair carries every upgraded install
forward without anybody writing a second module.

That is also the risk. Derived means a seed edit changes what a boot-path
repair rewrites on customer data, with nobody necessarily aware that it did. So
the derivation is pinned here. Adding a second window to a rate line is meant
to fail this test and make somebody look at what the repair is now going to do
to every install in the field.

The gap this closes is measured rather than assumed
---------------------------------------------------
Nothing else in the tree notices a new window.
``test_tax_seed_reconcile_covers_the_seed_file`` pins ``anchor_lines()``, which
is a set of ``(country_code, tax_code)`` pairs - giving an existing line a
second window leaves both its count and its digest untouched, and
``test_tax_tables_do_not_drift`` reads rates rather than window structure. That
is exactly how Nova Scotia's cut reached new installs, skipped every old one,
and went a year without a red test.

#: Every rate line the shipped file carries more than one window of, less the
#: lines another repair owns. Written out rather than counted: a count would
#: pass if one line were swapped for another, and the new one is precisely the
#: one nobody has looked at.
#:
#: ``IL/VAT`` was added on 2026-09-02, and this test failing is what it was
#: supposed to do. What was looked at before updating it, since that is the
#: whole purpose of the pin:
#:
#: * Israel raised standard VAT from 17 % to 18 % on 2025-01-01 (Israel Tax
#:   Authority; legislated in the 2025 Economic Arrangements Law). The seed
#:   file had gone on shipping 17 with no ``effective_to``, so the platform
#:   stated 17 as the rate in force while its own methodology catalogue said
#:   18. The 17 % window is closed at 2024-12-31 and the 18 % one added beside
#:   it, so a bill priced before 2025 still prices at 17.
#: * What the repair will therefore do to installs in the field: close the
#:   open 17 % row and insert the 18 % one. That is the intended reading of
#:   the change to the seed file, on the same argument as Nova Scotia's.
#: * The flag stays still. Both Israeli windows ship ``is_default`` true,
#:   which the module docstring covers at length: ``_country_wide_standard``
#:   reads the flag only among rows in force on the date asked about, and two
#:   windows of one line never overlap. So the repair's predicate matches
#:   without ``also_updates`` gaining anything, and the assertion below that
#:   it stays empty still holds.
#:
#: The population growing also moved ``EARLIEST_SUPERSEDED_FROM`` from
#: 2025-04-01 to 2025-01-01, because Israel's rise predates Nova Scotia's cut.
