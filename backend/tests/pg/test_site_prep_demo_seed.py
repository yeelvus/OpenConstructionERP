# DDC-CWICR-OE: DataDrivenConstruction - OpenConstructionERP
"""The site prep demo seed must fill the register, attach it, and fill it once.

Site prep shipped complete and unseeded, so the readiness rollup, the category
breakdown and the commencement gate all opened empty on every project. The
seeder that fixes that has four ways to be wrong that a green exit code cannot
show, so each is pinned here against a real database:

* it writes rows the module itself would refuse. Every row goes through
  ``SitePrepService`` with a real ``SitePrepItemCreate``, but the seeder holds
  each project in its own SAVEPOINT and logs the failure rather than raising -
  which is right for a boot-time seeder and means a rejected row shows up here
  as an empty register, not as an exception. So the counts are asserted, not
  just the absence of an error.
* it writes items that belong to no plan. An unattached item still renders in
  the list and still counts in the rollup, so nothing looks broken; what breaks
  is the countdown, because the target start date lives on the plan.
* it doubles the register on the second boot, because idempotency in this
  codebase is per loop rather than per seeder.
* it produces a register the readiness engine cannot say anything interesting
  about - every project identical, no gate ever blocking, nothing ever overdue.

The last one is asserted through ``get_readiness`` and ``get_gate_status``
themselves rather than by restating their rules, so a change to what counts as
ready, blocked or overdue fails here.
