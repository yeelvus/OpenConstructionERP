"""The version the banner names and the notes it shows must be one release.

``GET /api/system/version-check`` reads two sources. The number comes from
PyPI, which is the source of truth precisely because a hotfix can publish a
wheel without a GitHub release object being created; the notes, the link and
the date come from the newest GitHub release. In exactly the case that
motivates the preference, those two are a release apart, and the endpoint used
to publish them together: "15.1.0 is available", under it the notes for
15.0.0, and a link to the 15.0.0 release page.

For a desktop build that is not a cosmetic mismatch. The frozen bundle carries
no pip, so the only remedy it can offer is "download the installer from the
release page", and the page it was linking to is one that does not carry the
build the reader was just told to install.

These tests need no database and no authentication - the route touches
neither - but they live in the PG lane because that is the lane the real gate
runs. ``tests/unit`` is reached only by the files ci-postgres.yml names one by
one, and a test nobody runs is not a gate.
