# DDC-CWICR-OE: DataDrivenConstruction · OpenConstructionERP
"""A market DDC ships must not read as unpublished in the v3 registry.

``_HF_PUBLISHED`` in :mod:`app.modules.costs.cwicr_v3_catalogue` is the hand
kept record of which regions DDC has actually published a v3 BGE-M3 snapshot
for. A region missing from it stays ``available=False``, so the setup grid
renders a "coming soon" card with the Install CTA disabled and the install
endpoint answers 409, while the file sits on the CDN. Nothing in the module
notices, because every other check in the registry's own test file reads that
same mapping and therefore agrees with it by construction.

The check here reads a second structure that knows nothing about publication
status: :mod:`app.modules.costs.base_registry`, whose global markets are
derived from its own family tables and which names the market by the id the
published file carries (``ZH_SHANGHAI``, ``TR_ISTANBUL``) rather than by the
platform id the region was later renamed to (``ZH_CHINA``, ``TR_NATIONAL``).
Two tables written at different times for different jobs, so agreement between
them is evidence rather than a tautology.

That is not a hypothetical. Both Chinese and Turkish snapshots were published
on 2026-05-11, in the same batch as the forty rows that work, and were left out
of the mapping.
