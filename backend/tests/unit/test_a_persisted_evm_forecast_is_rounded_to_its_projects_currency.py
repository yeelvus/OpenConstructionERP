"""EAC / VAC / ETC are written to the row in the project currency's own units.

These three are not a view. ``FinanceService.create_evm_snapshot`` computes
them and persists them on ``oe_finance_evm_snapshot``, whose model declares
``eac``, ``vac``, ``etc`` and ``tcpi`` as stored columns. They were quantised
to ``Decimal("0.01")`` for every project on earth, so a Kuwaiti dinar's third
digit was gone before the INSERT and no reader downstream could put it back,
while a yen was stored carrying two decimals nothing in Japan can settle.

That is the difference between this file and its sibling for the schedule
rollup: a response-only rounding defect changes what one reader sees on one
request, and a persisted one has been writing wrong values into rows that are
still there.

The project's currency is the one in scope here (``Project.currency``, the
project base currency the same method already resolves for its FX blending),
and the quantum comes from ``app.core.money.money_quantum``, the platform's
single value-layer resolver. These tests assert against that resolver rather
than against a table of their own, so a currency whose count changes tomorrow
is covered without anybody editing this file.
