"""i18n plural guard: block a counted key missing a form its language needs.

The orphan guard answers "can this key be reached at all", and says so in
its own comments: a Russian file carrying only `_other` counts as reachable
there, because "reachable" and "complete" are different questions. This
guard asks the second one.

Why it matters, and it is not theoretical. i18next resolves a counted key
through the CLDR category its language returns for that number. When the
form is absent, it does NOT quietly fall back to `_other` in the same
language - it walks the fallback chain and prints the English. So a Turkish
file holding `_other` but no `_one` shows an English sentence on a Turkish
screen for every count of one, and every other gate we own reports green:
the key is reachable, the value is not byte-identical to English, no escape
was dropped, tsc and the build never look at locale content at all.

Three things worth knowing about how it counts.

  * Categories come from the language, never from English. English has two
    and would let Arabic ship four holes and Polish two. The table below is
    generated from the same source i18next consults, `Intl.PluralRules`.
    Six languages here have a single category, `other`, and for those an
    absent `_one` is the correct answer rather than a gap.

  * A suffix is not always a plural, and this is the whole difficulty.
    `assembly.params.err_div_by_zero` is division by zero and
    `agents.pick_one` is an instruction to pick one; neither is a form of
    anything. Grouping by suffix alone cannot tell those from a real
    plural, so this guard does not try. It asks the call sites instead: a
    key is counted only where the source calls `t(key, {... count ...})`,
    which is precisely the condition under which i18next consults CLDR at
    all. Keys nothing calls with a count are left alone, and a key named
    literally with its suffix is excluded outright.

    That makes the guard deliberately narrow. A count passed through a
    spread or a variable is invisible here and such a key goes unchecked.
    A gate that misses a case is repairable; one that cries wolf on 500
    ordinary keys gets switched off, and then it catches nothing at all.

  * A group is only judged where the language already answers it. A key
    absent from a locale entirely is the orphan guard's business, not this
    one, and reporting it here would fail two gates for one cause and make
    both messages less trustworthy.

Regenerating the category table, when a locale is added:

    node -e "const l=['ar','bg',...];const o={};for(const x of l)
      o[x]=new Intl.PluralRules(x).resolvedOptions().pluralCategories;
      console.log(JSON.stringify(o,null,1))"

Known debt lives in scripts/i18n_plural_baseline.json and may only shrink.
