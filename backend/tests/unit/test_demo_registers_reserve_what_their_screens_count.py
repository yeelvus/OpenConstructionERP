"""A demo register must reserve, by construction, the row its screen counts.

This is the general form of a defect that was found in the interface register
and fixed there: demo content is drawn at random, a screen exists to show a
particular thing, and nothing guarantees the draw produces that thing. A
register that merely *usually* carries an overdue row is a lottery played once
per install, and the lane assertion that reads the tile is a lottery played once
per run.

The registers checked here are already built the safe way: the size of a
project's register and the status at each position come from the project's
ordinal, not from its RNG, so the reserved row exists by construction. What was
never checked is the precondition that construction rests on - that the reserved
position is still inside the shortest register the seeder can produce, and that
the value sitting there is still one the report counts. Both are one edit away
from being false, and neither edit fails anything today: shortening a count
tuple or reordering a plan would leave every existing test green until a
merge-blocking PostgreSQL lane went red on a machine nobody could reproduce.

So each check below is a property of the plan rather than an observation about
one run, and each one is paired with a control that points the same predicate at
a deliberately broken plan. A predicate that has never been shown to fail says
nothing when it passes.
