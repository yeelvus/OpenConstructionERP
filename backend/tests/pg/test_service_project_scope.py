"""A project-scoped service listing must filter in the query, not after it.

The Service module is mounted twice: flat at ``/service``, which is the
tenant-wide dispatcher view, and under ``/projects/:projectId/service``. The
second mount used to be a lie - the page loaded the same tenant-wide lists
and printed them under a project's name.

Contracts and tickets could already be scoped server-side. Work orders could
not: they carry no ``project_id``, the project is two joins away through the
ticket and the contract. The tempting fix is to narrow the loaded page in the
browser, and that is the case pinned here: the listing is paginated, so a
client-side narrowing takes the newest N work orders across the whole tenant
and only then drops the foreign ones. A quiet project then shows an empty tab
while its own work orders sit just past the page boundary.

Against real PostgreSQL because the filter is a two-hop join and because the
ordering it pages by is the thing under test.
