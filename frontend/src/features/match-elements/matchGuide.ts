// "How it works" guide content for the CAD-BIM Match to Cost module
// (/match-elements). Concept-first cards for a construction professional:
// what matching a model against a cost catalogue means, what the match
// score is, how to fill in each step, and how confirmed matches become a
// real priced bill of quantities.
//
// i18n: every string carries its inline English default and is consumed
// via t(key, { defaultValue }). The keys are not in en.ts, the inline
// defaults are the English source; their translations live in the other
// locale files, so a changed default needs its translations redone too.
