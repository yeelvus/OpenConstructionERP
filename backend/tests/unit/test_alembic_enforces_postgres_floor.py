# DDC-CWICR-OE: DataDrivenConstruction - OpenConstructionERP
"""The version floor, on the path an operator takes without booting the app.

``alembic upgrade head`` reaches a database on its own, and on a blank server
``alembic/env.py`` does not walk the revision chain at all - it builds the whole
current schema with ``Base.metadata.create_all`` and stamps head. So the one
command an operator is most likely to run against a freshly provisioned cluster
is also the one that creates every table on it. If it does not ask the server
what it is first, an unsupported or unidentifiable server gets a schema built on
it and the first symptom arrives much later as a broken query somewhere
unrelated, which is the exact failure ``app.core.postgres_version`` exists to
prevent on the application's own path.

What these tests drive is the real thing: ``alembic.command.upgrade`` executes
``env.py``, which builds its engine through ``sqlalchemy.create_engine``. That
one call is replaced with an engine that answers the two version statements
however the test wants, so the path is genuinely walked rather than the guard
being called directly. A test that only called the guard would prove it works
and prove nothing about whether migrations reach it, and a guard that is
imported but never executed produces exactly the clean result of one that
passed.

Nothing here asserts an absence. Every test asserts something that only
happened: a refusal, or - for the supported server - that ``env.py`` got past
the guard and opened a third connection to start schema work.

Before the fix these fail because ``env.py`` never consulted the version at all,
so the first connection it opens is the schema probe and the run dies in
``sa.inspect`` on a connection that is not a real one.
