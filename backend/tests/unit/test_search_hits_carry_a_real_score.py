"""Unified search hits carry a relevance score, and it ranks them.

Every result the global search returned scored 0%. The query path was
fine - results came back - but ``_hit_from_row`` in the search service
took ``rank_score: float = 0.0`` and nothing ever filled it in, so every
SQL-track hit reached the frontend at exactly zero and the modal drew
``Math.round(0 * 100)`` for all of them. On a stock install the SQL
track is the only track (``lancedb`` and ``fastembed`` live in the
optional ``[vector]`` extra), so that was every result a reader saw.

The response schema was never at fault: ``score`` is declared, and
``ge=0.0`` makes 0.0 valid, so serialisation had nothing to catch.

Two things are pinned here, because a score that is merely non-zero is
no better than the zero was:

* a matching hit scores above zero, and
* the better of two matches scores strictly higher, so the number
  carries relevance rather than a rank position or a constant.

The vector track is stubbed out rather than skipped, so these tests
describe the configuration the defect was reported in: no embedding
model installed, SQL recall only.
