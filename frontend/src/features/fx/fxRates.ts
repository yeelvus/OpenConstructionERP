/**
 * The pure decisions the FX screen makes for itself.
 *
 * They live apart from the panel deliberately. Importing the panel pulls in the
 * shared UI barrel, which transitively boots i18next with the whole English
 * resource, and a vitest worker that does that never answers. The type import
 * below is erased at compile time, so this module has no runtime dependency on
 * anything at all.
 *
 * Two rules govern everything here.
 *
 * **Nothing converts money.** When the backend has already priced something it
 * is rendered as it arrived. The only arithmetic below is on *rates* — asking
 * which direction a pair reads in, and how far apart two dates are — because
 * those are questions the screen has to answer about figures it was given, not
 * a second opinion on the figures themselves.
 *
 * **The screen must not vouch for more than the server will do.** Where a
 * helper looks stricter than it needs to be, that is why: `cross_rate` in the
 * service raises for a currency the applied set does not quote, including when
 * both sides of the pair are that same currency, so a screen that quietly
 * answered 1 would be promising a conversion the API refuses with a 422.
