"""Wires scripts/check_locale_resolution.py into the pytest run.

That script is a regression LOCK, not a bug report: the defect it guards is
not live today and its own docstring says so and shows the measurement. This
file makes it fire on every ordinary backend test run. ci.yml's "Run unit
tests with pytest" step runs ``pytest tests/unit`` directory-scoped, so a new
file here is collected with no workflow change.

The red proof is the reason to believe any of it. Rather than a synthetic
fixture, it loads the three catalogues that actually carried this defect as
they stood before 341d37ca7 fixed them, and requires the lock to flag all
three and to clear all three post-fix versions. Those are the exact defects it
exists to catch, so passing against them is evidence and not decoration. Both
backend lanes check out with fetch-depth 0, so the history is present in CI.

Every one of these red proofs failed at least once while being written, which
is the only reason they are trusted: the ownership filter compared against a
dotted label and silently skipped every function in a file-loaded module, the
argument filler could not reach risk.localize's table, and the bundle probe
duck-typed on an attribute the pre-fix bcf copy did not have. Each of those
made the lock report a known defect as clean.
