"""A calendar naming no working day must not silently zero the count.

``work_days`` is the weekly pattern, so a row with an empty one states no
working week at all. Counted with, it makes every date in every range a
non-working day, and the caller gets ``working_days: 0`` with a 200 and no
warning anywhere. That is the shape of failure this module keeps producing: not
an error, a plausible number.

The branch that made it dangerous is the out-of-range lookup. It builds a
mapping of year to week and then asks only whether the mapping is non-empty, so
a single empty week put a key in the mapping while putting nothing in the week.
The year then reported ``carried``, naming a real calendar as its source, and
counted nothing. A caller reading the disclosure would have been told the answer
came from a declared calendar, which was true, and would still have had a zero.

No shipped calendar has an empty week - all thirty seeded rows declare five
days - so nothing else will ever exercise this. These tests are the only thing
that will.
