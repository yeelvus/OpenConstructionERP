"""A package raised over part of a bill is compared against that part.

Both comparison screens - the leveling matrix and the budget comparison - load
the package's BOQ, which is the whole bill. A package covering a quarter of it
therefore used to put the other three quarters on the reference side, where
every bidder read as having omitted them: each out-of-scope line was imputed at
the bidder's own mean rate, so a bid of 812,400 levelled to roughly four times
that and was measured against a budget four times its own.

Two writers declare a scope and they say it differently. ``create_from_boq``
freezes the lines it chose into ``line_item_template``; the demo installer
records a plain ``scope_position_ids`` list. The reader accepts either, because
the question they answer is the same one.

Pure filtering over stub positions, so it needs no database.
