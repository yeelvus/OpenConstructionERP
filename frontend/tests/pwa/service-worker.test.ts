/**
 * PWA service-worker test — verifies the generated ``dist/sw.js``
 * registers the three runtime cache lanes declared in vite.config.ts:
 *   * oce-static-assets   (CacheFirst, fonts/images/asset chunks)
 *   * oce-i18n-locales    (StaleWhileRevalidate, per-locale chunks)
 *   * oce-api             (NetworkFirst, /api/v1/* GETs)
 *
 * AN ABSENT BUILD IS A FAILURE HERE, NOT A SKIP, and that is the whole
 * point of this file's shape. It used to open with
 * ``describe.skipIf(!hasBuild)``, so on any tree that had not been built
 * the file reported green having read nothing at all. ``dist/`` is
 * gitignored and nothing in this suite builds it, so that was the normal
 * state rather than an edge case. A reader who sees green takes it to
 * mean "the lanes are there"; what it really meant was "the file was
 * never opened", and those two answers must not be able to look alike.
 *
 * The artifact is deliberately NOT generated here on the fly from the
 * config. What is being asked about is the file a visitor's browser
 * downloads, and ``public/sw.js`` is copied verbatim onto this same path
 * during a build - so a test that generated its own copy out of
 * vite.config.ts would go green over precisely the collision that would
 * hurt, while proving only that workbox-build still works.
 *
 * Cost, and who pays it: reading build output means these tests need a
 * build in front of them. ci.yml's macOS runner skips the build on
 * purpose (a 9 GB heap does not fit a 7 GB runner), so that lane excludes
 * this directory by name. The exclusion is written where a reader can see
 * it instead of being hidden inside a test that reports green with
 * nothing to read.
