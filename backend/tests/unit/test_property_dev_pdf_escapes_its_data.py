"""Names go into a property_dev PDF as text, not as markup.

A reportlab ``Paragraph`` takes a small HTML-like markup, so anything
interpolated into one is parsed rather than printed. A developer called
"Meyer & Sohn" is not an unusual name and the ampersand is not an unusual
character, but it is markup here, and the generator handed it straight to the
parser.

Every way this goes wrong is silent. Nothing raises, the file still opens, it
still looks plausible and it still goes to a regulator. Measured against the
unfixed renderer, the parser does four different things:

* ``<`` starts a tag, so "Baufeld <Nord>" draws as "Baufeld" and the rest of
  the name is gone.
* ``&`` followed by a letter reads as an unterminated entity and a semicolon
  is injected after the next word: "R&D Tower" draws as "R&D; Tower" and
  "AT&T Plaza" draws as "AT&T; Plaza".
* ``&amp;`` in the data decodes, so a name stored as "Haus &amp; Hof" draws as
  "Haus & Hof".
* ``&`` followed by a space is left alone, which is the only reason the
  shipped clause headings have never shown the fault.

That last case is why "Meyer & Sohn" alone is a weak test. It passes against
the unfixed renderer, not because the path is safe but because the input
happens to dodge the parser. The cases that carry the finding are the ones
where an ordinary name is corrupted.

These tests assert on the produced document rather than on the escaping
helper, since the property being defended is that the characters reach the
page.
