# time (so rates persist with their true currency) AND lazily on read for
# legacy rows that landed with ``currency = ''`` before this map existed.
#

# from the base registry the importer itself reads, so every base that can
# be loaded can be priced. See that module for why: a currency table that
# covered fewer regions than the loader accepted is what let one import

# regionally - so their work items import with a zero rate. These endpoints hold
# one editable unit price per resource per region, seed it from whatever prices a
# base already carries, and re-price every work item from the sheet
# (rate = sum(component.quantity x price)). The same path re-prices a priced base
# after a local price edit, so it is uniform for coded and codeless bases.

# naming files that no longer existed, while the parquet map, already derived,
# went on working. Deriving it also reaches the nineteen markets the hand table
# never listed.
#
# The two aliases below are not the same kind of thing, whatever the line they

# put it in the same folder as ENG_TORONTO. ZH_CHINA is the China Dinge
# national base, whose own work items are Asia-China-Dinge/ZH_CHINA…parquet at
# 10486 positions, and this hands it the global base's Shanghai snapshot, built
# from a different catalogue of 55719. It arrived with the first national bases
# and the six that followed got nothing, so TR_NATIONAL and the other six
# answer 404 here.
#
# Do not make that symmetric by adding them. No national base has a published
# vector snapshot, which is exactly what github_snapshot_files() leaves out and
# what test_every_downloadable_base_has_a_snapshot_and_no_other_one_does
# guards; a second alias would walk another one past it. Whether ZH_CHINA
# should keep this line or join the other seven is open, because what a

    Accepts a multipart file upload. The file must be .xlsx or .csv.

    Expected columns (flexible auto-detection):
    - **Code / Item Code / Nr.** -- unique cost item code (auto-generated when missing)
    - **Description / Beschreibung / Text** -- description (required)
    - **Unit / Einheit / ME** -- unit of measurement
    - **Rate / Price / Cost / EP** -- unit rate or price (required)
    - **Currency / Wahrung** -- currency code (defaults to the catalog currency)
    - **Classification / DIN 276 / KG** -- classification code

    The mapping (auto-detection + user ``column_map``) MUST cover
    ``description`` and ``rate`` - otherwise the import is rejected with
    422 instead of silently importing rows with empty text or zero rates.

    Catalog targeting: pass ``catalog_id`` to import into an existing

    no currency column) to create one inline. Rows without a currency
    inherit the catalog currency; rows carrying a DIFFERENT currency are

    Uses PostgreSQL's native ``COPY`` into a staging table cloned from the target
    (no indexes), then a single ``INSERT ... SELECT ... ON CONFLICT (code, region)
    DO NOTHING`` into the live table. A 55K-row regional database loads in a few
    seconds, matching the SQLite ``INSERT OR IGNORE`` fast path.

    The previous implementation issued one 1000-row multi-VALUES ``INSERT`` per
    batch. Each statement paid a large SQLAlchemy Core compile (≈16K bind
    parameters) plus a server-side parse of the same, so a single regional import
    took roughly three minutes on embedded PostgreSQL versus ~5 seconds on
    SQLite. The synchronous HTTP request then timed out and the client saw no
    response -- the user-visible "crash" in issue #171. ``COPY`` skips per-row SQL
    parsing entirely and closes that gap.

    Duplicate ``(code, region)`` pairs are silently skipped via the
    ``uq_costs_code_region`` constraint, exactly like the SQLite path. Runs on a
    short-lived sync engine built from ``database_sync_url`` (falling back to the
    live ``DATABASE_SYNC_URL`` env var, which embedded PG wires in after the
    Settings cache is built) so the load always reaches the real cluster.

        sync_url: Sync SQLAlchemy URL (e.g. ``postgresql+psycopg2://...``).
        rows: Positional tuples in the SQLite column order

            classification, tags, components, descriptions, is_active,
            region, metadata)``. The five JSON columns carry pre-serialized JSON
            text and stream straight into the ``json`` columns -- no decode /
            re-encode round-trip.

    * The classic CIS parquets split ONE sentence across the columns, a parent

      them prints the item twice ("Demolition of the Catalan vault, including
      manual loading Demolition of the vault to the flat arch, including manual
      loading"), so those keep a single copy.
