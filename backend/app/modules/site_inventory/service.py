"""Site-inventory service layer.

Async data access on top of the module's own tables, plus the read-side loaders
that build :class:`app.modules.site_inventory.ledger.Movement` lists and the
per-position BoQ budgets fed to the pure computation core. Every referenced id
(item, location, BoQ position, procurement goods receipt) is confirmed to belong
to the same project before a movement is written, so a movement can never be
attached to another project's resource even when the caller is authorised on
