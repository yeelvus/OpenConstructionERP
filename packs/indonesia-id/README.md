# Indonesia Construction Pack

Configures OpenConstructionERP for the Indonesian construction market. Estimating
in Indonesia follows the AHSP (Analisa Harga Satuan Pekerjaan) unit rate analysis
method, where every work item is built up from its material, labour and equipment
components against SNI standards. Currency is IDR with 11% PPN on construction
services.

## What makes an Indonesian estimate Indonesian

A RAB (Rencana Anggaran Biaya, project cost plan) in Indonesia is structured as a
detailed unit rate analysis. Each work item carries an AHSP breakdown showing the
material quantities, labour coefficients and equipment hours that make up its unit
rate, referenced against SNI (Standar Nasional Indonesia) standards. The unit rate
analysis is not just documentation - it is how the price is built, and a RAB
without AHSP breakdowns is not a RAB a government client can evaluate.

Public procurement follows Perpres 16/2018 (Presidential Regulation on Government
Procurement of Goods and Services) administered through the LKPP (Lembaga Kebijakan
Pengadaan Barang/Jasa Pemerintah). Construction services are regulated under UU
No. 2/2017 (Jasa Konstruksi). The Kementerian PUPR (Ministry of Public Works and
Housing) publishes the AHSP reference coefficients and regional price indices.

PPN (Pajak Pertambahan Nilai, VAT) on construction services is 11 percent. The
pack sets the `id_ppn_11` tax template.
