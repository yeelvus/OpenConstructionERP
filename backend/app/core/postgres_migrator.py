"""PostgreSQL auto-migrator (embedded and external PostgreSQL).

On startup, compares the live PostgreSQL schema against the SQLAlchemy models
and adds any missing columns via ``ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS``
plus any missing model-declared plain-column indexes via
``CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS`` (upgraded installs are alembic-STAMPED, not
alembic-run, so an index added in a later release - e.g.
``ix_oe_costs_item_catalog_id`` - would otherwise never materialise and the
largest table would seq-scan forever).

This is the PostgreSQL counterpart to :func:`app.core.sqlite_migrator.sqlite_auto_migrate`.
The embedded-PostgreSQL default runtime (v6.0.0+, no Docker) builds its schema
with ``Base.metadata.create_all``, which only ever creates *missing tables* and
never alters an existing one. So when the app is upgraded across versions, any
column added to an existing table (for example ``oe_boq_position.cost_line_id``
from the v6.4.0 cost spine) is absent from a database created under the older
version, and every ORM read of that table fails with ``UndefinedColumnError``.

This runs for the embedded server AND for external PostgreSQL. External
deployments are still expected to manage their schema with Alembic
(``alembic upgrade head``), but in practice many run the image without that
step, so an upgrade that added a column leaves the live table missing it and
every ORM read 500s. Because every statement here is ``ADD COLUMN`` /
``CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS`` - idempotent and non-destructive - it is safe
to run as a belt-and-braces heal regardless of who owns the schema. The call
site wraps it non-fatally so a DB role without DDL rights simply skips it.

Concurrency- and traffic-safe on shared external databases: the heal takes a
transaction-scoped advisory lock (only one worker heals at a time), bounds each
DDL with ``SET LOCAL lock_timeout`` so it never blocks live queries behind an
open transaction, and wraps every statement in its own SAVEPOINT so a single
failure cannot poison the rest of the heal.

    ``oe_progress_entry.seq`` is a BIGINT whose server default is
    ``nextval('oe_progress_entry_seq_seq')``. On a database created before that
    column existed, the column heal below emits
    ``ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN ... DEFAULT nextval(...)`` - and PostgreSQL
    rejects that statement outright when the sequence is absent, taking the two
    indexes over the column and its unique constraint down with it, all at
    WARNING level while the boot carries on.

    **Do not assume ``create_all`` has this covered - it never will.** That
    assumption is what produced the bug. ``SchemaGenerator.visit_metadata``
    builds its standalone sequence list as
    ``[s for s in metadata._sequences.values() if s.column is None and ...]``,
    and a sequence passed to ``mapped_column`` has ``s.column`` set, so it is
    filtered out. Its only other route is ``CREATE TABLE``, which does not run
    for a table that already exists - precisely the databases that need healing.
    So the ordering of the two calls was never the issue: moving the heal after
    ``create_all`` would fix nothing. After this function, the heal is the only
    thing in the whole app-managed upgrade path that will ever create such a
    sequence. Verified against a live cluster in
    ``tests/pg/test_postgres_migrator_sequence_heal.py``.

    Deliberately no ``OWNED BY``. ``create_all`` does not emit it either, and
    this runs immediately before ``create_all`` against the same database, so
    matching it keeps one install from having two different sequence shapes
    depending on which statement got there first. (The Alembic path *does* set
    ``OWNED BY``, so the two schema-building routes already disagree - a
    divergence to settle deliberately, not to paper over here.)

    Do not compare ``constraint.name`` against what the database reports. The
    metadata naming convention in ``app.database`` re-wraps an already-prefixed
    name, so several model-declared constraints resolve to more than 63 bytes.
    ``create_all`` did not store those chopped at 63, it stored them
    **hash-mangled**: 64 characters of
    ``ck_oe_erp_chat_turn_feedback_ck_oe_erp_chat_turn_feedback_rating`` live in
    PostgreSQL as ``ck_oe_erp_chat_turn_feedback_ck_oe_erp_chat_turn_feedba_b8d8``.
    Neither the full name nor a plain ``[:63]`` slice matches that, so a name
    comparison decides the constraint is missing, and re-adding it under a raw
    ``ALTER TABLE`` produces a *second* constraint enforcing the same rule under a
    differently mangled name, on every upgrade.

    Comparing the expression instead does not work either: PostgreSQL rewrites
    what it stores, so ``rating IN (-1, 1)`` comes back as
    ``rating = ANY (ARRAY['-1'::integer, 1])``.

    So ask the component that produced the name in the first place. This is the
    same preparer ``create_all`` used, and it returns the identical string.

    """Add unique, check and foreign-key constraints the live table is missing.

    ``create_all`` builds a brand-new table with every constraint it declares, so
    a fresh install is never short of one. The gap is a constraint *added to a
    table that already exists*: alembic knows how to do that, this path did not,
    and an install upgraded through ``create_all`` lost it silently.

    The unique constraints are the ones that carry weight. Six tables generate
    their document number as ``MAX(suffix) + 1``, flush inside a savepoint, and
    catch ``IntegrityError`` to retry. The constraint is not a backstop sitting
    behind an application check, it **is** the check. Without it two people
    raising an NCR in the same moment both commit NCR-001, with no error, no
    warning and no log line, on an instrument that gets quoted by number in
    contractual claims.

    Two rules keep this from turning a broken install into an install that will
    not boot, which is the real hazard: the databases missing a constraint are
    exactly the ones that may hold rows violating it.

    * A unique is pre-flighted with ``GROUP BY ... HAVING count(*) > 1``. If the
      table already holds duplicates the constraint cannot be added at all, so we
      log loudly, name the columns, and leave the table alone rather than raise.
    * Check and foreign-key constraints go on as ``NOT VALID``. PostgreSQL then
      enforces them for every new row without scanning the rows already there, so
      an install with bad history keeps running and can be cleaned up later with
      ``VALIDATE CONSTRAINT``.

    ``NOT NULL`` is deliberately not healed. It needs a backfill decision per
    column and it is the one that can destroy data.

    Every statement gets its own SAVEPOINT for the same reason the rest of this
    module does, and nothing here raises to the caller.

    **Names must be compared truncated, and this is not a detail.** The metadata
    naming convention in ``app.database`` re-wraps an already-prefixed constraint
    name, so a handful of model-declared names come out longer than PostgreSQL's
    63-byte identifier limit. ``create_all`` stored those truncated. Comparing the
    full model-side name against what the database reports therefore never
    matches, and the heal concludes a constraint is missing when it is sitting
    right there. Re-adding it does not collide either, because a raw ``ALTER
    TABLE`` truncates by a plain byte chop while SQLAlchemy's own compiler
    hash-mangles, so the result is a second constraint enforcing the same rule
    under a different name, added on every upgrade. Measured on
    ``oe_erp_chat_turn_feedback`` and ``oe_takeoff_measurement``. The index loop
    above has carried the same guard for the same reason since it was written.

    Uniques get a column-tuple fallback on top of the name check, since that is
    what actually identifies the constraint when its name cannot be trusted.

    Args:
        conn: The open async connection running inside the heal transaction.
        table: The SQLAlchemy table to heal.
        existing_names: Constraint and index names already live on the table.
        existing_col_tuples: Column tuples already covered by a live index or
            unique constraint, used to recognise a constraint whose name was
            truncated or mangled.

        Number of constraints added.
