// The approval boundary's own arithmetic (Issue #435). The rendered flow is
// tested in commercialBoundaryPayloads.test.tsx; what is pinned here is the
// part a screen test cannot show clearly: the exact wire keys, and the two
// edges of "does this amount depart from what was submitted".
//
// The keys matter on their own because the approve route accepts unknown ones.
// `decided_amount` is what it reads; `agreed_cost_impact` is what it serves
// back, and posting the figure under that name returns 200 and records the
// bill total instead. Nothing downstream would report the difference.
