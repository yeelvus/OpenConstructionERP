"""The boot-path data-repair runner, against a real database with rows in it.

Why this suite is shaped the way it is
--------------------------------------
The defect underneath ``app.core.data_repairs`` is that a data rewrite never
happens while every signal reports success. "Does nothing" is the bug, and
"does nothing" passes a happy-path test that only checks for the absence of an
error. So the controls here are not decoration:

* :func:`test_an_empty_registry_leaves_the_same_database_branded` runs the same
  fixture through the same entry point with the registry emptied, and requires
  the rows to come out UNREPAIRED. If that ever passes while the registry is
  full, the positive test above it was measuring nothing.
* :func:`test_a_catalogue_with_nothing_to_repair_is_left_alone` is the other
  direction: a database that should not be rewritten has to come out
  byte-identical, compared row by row rather than by the absence of an
  exception.
* :func:`test_the_ledger_does_not_gate_the_repair` states the design rule in a
  form that can fail. A ledger row claiming the repair already ran must not
  stop it running, because a table allowed to answer "already done" over data
  that was never rewritten is ``alembic_version``, and that is the defect this
  module exists because of.

Isolation
---------
``pg_session`` hands out one session. The runner takes a *factory* and opens a
session per repair plus one per ledger write, so this file builds its own
factory over a single connection inside one outer transaction: every session it
hands out joins that transaction as a savepoint, the runner's ``commit()`` calls
become savepoint releases, and the rollback at teardown takes the whole thing
back out of the shared cluster.

The trademarked strings are never written here. They are read from
``LEGACY_BRANDED_SYSTEMS``, which is the single shipped copy and exists as a
search key; see the docstring of ``app.modules.formwork.debrand``.
