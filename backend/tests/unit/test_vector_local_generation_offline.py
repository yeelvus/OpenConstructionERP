"""The offline fallback of the vector loader has to survive its own first line.

When the pre-built embeddings cannot be fetched, this endpoint falls back to
generating them locally from the cost items already in the database. That branch
unpacked ``CostItemRepository.search`` into two names while the method returns
three, so it raised ``ValueError`` before doing anything. The surrounding
``except`` turned that into "vector generation failed", which named the
embedding model - so the message pointed at everything except the line above it.

Only an installation that cannot reach the download takes this branch, which is
why it could stay broken: the machines that never see it are the ones that would
have reported it.

The second test is the control. The first one runs against a stand-in
repository, and a stand-in is only evidence while it still matches the real
signature, so this pins the arity the stand-in was built from. If the repository
ever returns a different number of values, this fails and says so instead of
letting the first test keep passing against a contract that moved.
