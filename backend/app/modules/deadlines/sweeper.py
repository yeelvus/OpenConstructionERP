"""Cross-module overdue sweep - background push + escalation + digest.

The thin, impure glue that turns the read-only register (:mod:`service`) into a
proactive push. Modeled on ``approval_routes/sla_monitor.py``: a single
forever-loop wakes every :data:`POLL_INTERVAL_SECONDS`, never raises out, and is
started once from the application lifespan. No Celery, single process.

Per sweep, for every currently-overdue item across every project:

* notify the owner (or, when the owner is not a real user, the project
  managers) with an in-app ``deadline_overdue`` notification,
* fan the same event into the notification digest so users on an hourly/daily
  cadence get one rolled-up email instead of a stream,
* publish a ``deadlines.<module>.overdue`` timeline event, and
* once the item has sat past a grace window, escalate it to the project
  managers exactly once (``deadline_escalated``, metadata ``level=1``).

De-duplication is migration-free, exactly like ``sla_monitor``: before
notifying, the sweep reads the notification store for a recent
``deadline_overdue`` row on the same entity within :data:`RENOTIFY_WINDOW_HOURS`.
The escalation tier reconstructs from the ``deadline_escalated`` notifications'
``metadata.level`` so a target is escalated at most once. This reuses the
*technique* of ``escalation_service`` (notification-store tier dedup), not the
service itself, which is bound to approval Instance/Route/Step and not reusable.
