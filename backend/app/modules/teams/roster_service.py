"""Project roster service - who is on this job, and in what capacity.

Authorisation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Reads and writes both need project access, which is one gate lower than the
rest of this module. That is deliberate and it rests on a single property: a
roster line grants nothing. It cannot let anyone reach a project, a team or a
record. Maintaining the roster is daily site work - people arrive, tickets
expire, a subcontractor swaps a foreman - and putting it behind project
ownership would guarantee it goes stale, which is the failure mode that makes
the whole feature worthless.

The one thing that does change access, ``grant_project_access`` on an add, is
not handled here. It is delegated to :meth:`TeamService.add_member`, which
keeps the owner-or-admin gate and the elevated-role check in the single place
that has always owned them.

Where the people come from
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
:meth:`RosterService.list_candidates` searches platform users and address-book
contacts together, so a team is assembled from what the platform already knows
rather than retyped. Contacts are reached through a late import guarded by
``ImportError``: a module has to keep working when an optional module is not
installed, so a deployment without the contacts module simply offers users.
