// Case: "Turn a document into a tracked action".
//
// A letter, an RFI or a captured message becomes a task that carries its
// source with it, so the work is owned and the origin stays readable months
// later. Content strings are key plus inline English default and live only
// here.

Creating the task from the source keeps both, and the task then carries a badge showing which document it grew from, which is what makes the question asked six months later a one-click answer.",
