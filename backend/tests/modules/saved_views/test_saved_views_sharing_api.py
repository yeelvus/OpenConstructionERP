"""End-to-end behaviour of the saved-views API against a real database.

Three things only show up once rows and identities exist:

* sharing a view with a team hands the DEFINITION to that team and to nobody
  else, and never widens what the reader is allowed to see;
* saving a second view under a name the owner already used is a 409 that names
  the collision, not the 500 an ``IntegrityError`` produces on its way out;
* a view whose entity has drifted is marked before anyone clicks it, and its
  validation report says which field moved.

Three users share one project: its owner, a member of the team the view is
shared with, and a member of a different team on the same project. The third
one is the whole point - team membership grants project access, so a project
member who is not in the named team is exactly the reader a team share has to
exclude.

The app is built once per module (booting it is the expensive part).
