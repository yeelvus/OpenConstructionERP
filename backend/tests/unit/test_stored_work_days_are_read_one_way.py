"""Every reader of a stored working week reads it the same way, or refuses it.

Four readers used to wrap the whole conversion in ``except (TypeError,
ValueError)`` and fall back to Monday through Friday. That guard is ornamental
against the malformation that actually happens: a bare digit string does not
raise, it iterates one character at a time.

That makes this worse than the holiday defect one level up rather than merely
parallel to it. Ten junk date strings produce no holidays, which is at least a
calendar somebody might question. ``"12345"`` produces a clean five day week
nobody would look at twice, and ``"0123456"`` produces a seven day week in
which no date is ever non-working, so every duration computes short and every
finish date lands early. The wrong answer is indistinguishable from the right
one, which is why the guard has to be a type check before the iteration rather
than an except around it.
