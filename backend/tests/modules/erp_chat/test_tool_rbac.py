"""RBAC gate around the erp_chat tool registry.

The floating-chat tools split into READ (anyone authenticated) and WRITE
(manager+ on the referenced project). The dispatcher in
``ERPChatService._tool_loop`` enforces the split BEFORE invoking the
handler so a member cannot mutate via the AI chat what they could not
mutate via the regular HTTP endpoints.

Coverage in this module:

* manager calling ``create_boq_item`` succeeds (handler runs).
* member calling ``create_boq_item`` is refused with the
  ``manager_permission_required`` card — the BOQ position is NOT created.
* member calling ``get_boq_items`` succeeds (reads are open).
* cross-tenant manager calling ``create_boq_item`` for someone else's
  project gets the 404-style "project not found" card — never the role
  card, never a leak of project existence.

Tests run against a throwaway PostgreSQL database (cloned from a
schema-loaded template by ``tests._pg.isolated_engine``) — no FastAPI app
boot, no migrations.
