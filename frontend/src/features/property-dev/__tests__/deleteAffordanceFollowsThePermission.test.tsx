/**
 * The delete affordance has to follow the permission, not a role list that
 * was true once.
 *
 * `property_dev.owner_scoped_delete` sits at EDITOR level because on those
 * routes the wall is ownership rather than role. The drawer used to gate its
 * delete button on four role strings that predate that change, so the button
 * was shown to roles the ownership check rejects and hidden from the role the
 * change was made for. A UI that hides the button reads as a fix that did not
 * land, which is worse than one that shows a button the server refuses.
 *
 * This mounts the real drawer and asks the rendered document. It deliberately
 * does not assert on the constant, on a class name, or on a test id: a class
 * assertion has gone green over broken UI here before, and asserting on the
 * constant would only restate the source line it is supposed to check. The
 * query is by accessible role and name, which is what a person clicking has.
 *
 * The other half of the invariant, that the constant equals what the backend
 * admits, is enforced by scripts/check_role_mirrors_match_the_backend.py. This
 * file proves the constant reaches the screen; that one proves it is right.
