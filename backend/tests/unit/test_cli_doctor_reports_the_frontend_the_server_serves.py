"""The frontend check must answer from the server's lookup, not its own copy of it.

The check used to repeat the expression ``cli_static.get_frontend_dir()`` uses,
on the reasoning that two copies of one expression cannot disagree. In the
frozen desktop build they disagree, because the expression is identical and the
anchor is not: ``cli`` is the PyInstaller entry script and runs as ``__main__``
with ``__file__`` at the root of the unpacked bundle, while ``cli_static`` is a
module inside the ``app`` package with ``__file__`` one level down, which is
where the UI is unpacked. The copy looked one directory too high and reported
"no frontend" on a sidecar that was serving the UI.

That is not reproducible in a source checkout, where both anchors land in the
same place, so these tests pin the property that makes the bug impossible rather
than the symptom: the check reports whatever the lookup reports, including when
the lookup names somewhere the check would never have looked by itself.

        Status alone does not carry it. The old implementation also answered ok
        on a developer machine, because its second branch finds the repo's own
        frontend/dist and that exists in a checkout: the test would have passed
        against the code it was written to catch, for a reason having nothing to
        do with the fix. Measured, not supposed - it did exactly that.

        Naming the directory is what discriminates. The path below is reachable
        from nowhere this module would look, so a check still computing its own
        answer cannot put it in the message no matter which branch it takes.

        cli_static imports fastapi and starlette at module level, while this

        CLI diagnose an install whose dependencies did not resolve. run_preflight
        builds its list as a plain literal with no per-check guard, so an
        ImportError escaping this one check does not degrade a line, it aborts
        the report before anything prints.

        Asserting on the returned Check alone would not catch that, since a
        version that takes the whole run down never gets far enough to be asked.
