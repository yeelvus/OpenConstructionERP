"""Installing a module end to end, on the database it will run against.

Everything up to here checks a part: the spec refuses what cannot work, the
generator renders files that import, the table gets created. This checks the
one claim a user actually makes, which is that pressing install leaves them
with a module that is there.

It runs in the PostgreSQL lane because installing calls the module's own
startup hook, and that hook creates its table against the real engine.
