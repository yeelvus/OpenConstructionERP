# them, ``list_all_for_boq`` on a 6 k-position BOQ fires the main SELECT plus
# two extra ``selectin`` round trips (one ``parent_id IN (...)`` and one

    Issue #133 matches a resource code as ``str(code).strip().casefold()`` in
    Python, which no SQL expression reproduces, so this never decides a match.
    It only has to keep every row the Python match would accept, and drop most
    of the rest before their metadata crosses the wire and gets decoded.

    It holds that promise under three conditions, and answers ``None`` (no
    narrowing, scan everything) whenever one is missing:

    * PostgreSQL. ``jsonb`` renders a string value verbatim apart from ``"``,
      ``\\`` and control characters, and ``translate()`` lower-cases A-Z by a
      fixed table. ``lower()`` and ``ILIKE`` would not do: they fold by the
      database locale, and under a Turkish one ``I`` does not become ``i``.
    * Every code is printable ASCII without ``"`` or ``\\``, so it appears
      unescaped in the rendered JSON.
    * A stored code the Python match accepts is then ASCII too, apart from the
      handful of letters in ``_NON_ASCII_FOLDING_TO_ASCII``; a row carrying any
      of those is always kept.

    Every pattern is matched against the one folded text in a single
    ``LIKE ANY (ARRAY[...])``, which PostgreSQL evaluates once per row. One
    ``OR`` branch per pattern rendered and translated the whole metadata again
    for each of them, 25 times a row for a three-code resource: 2.7 s for a
    2160-position project on the E2E server, 7 s on a busy machine.
