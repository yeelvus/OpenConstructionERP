"""Closeout business logic (stateless service).

Drives the per-project handover package: seeding the checklist from a
template, recomputing completeness on every mutation, binding / verifying
evidence, AI-suggesting (never auto-applying) bindings, kicking off an
idempotent background build, and assembling the structured ZIP.

The ZIP assembler reuses the canonical zip+manifest+index.json+sha256
pattern from ``projects/bundle_export.py`` and the path-traversal-safe
local-upload copy logic from ``property_dev/service.py``.
