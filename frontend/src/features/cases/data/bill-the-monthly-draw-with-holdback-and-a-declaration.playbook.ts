// Case: "Bill the monthly draw with holdback and a declaration" (CA).
//
// The objection here is the strongest one a Canadian office manager has, and it
// is largely correct: their spreadsheet does compute the draw. What it does not
// do is survive a release, because a percentage recomputed each month and a
// balance with a history stop agreeing the moment money comes back. So the case
// spends its effort on the three facts a net figure has already lost, and on
// the sworn declaration being drawn from the payment record it declares.
// Content strings are key plus inline English default and live only here.

    "The 10 percent statutory holdback in the common-law provinces is not a discount on the cheque and is not negotiable downward. It is money you have earned that somebody else is holding and that has to come back, which makes it an account rather than a percentage. A draw package built as one net figure has already thrown away the three facts you need to chase it: what was certified, what was held this period, and what is held in total. Ontario went further from 1 January 2026 and made annual release mandatory whatever the contract says and whatever the length of the completion schedule, with notice published on prescribed Form 6 within 14 days of each contract anniversary and payment falling between 60 and 74 days after the date of publication. A balance nobody can reconcile before the anniversary is a release nobody can claim after it.",
