"""Regional configuration for the State of California.

Ownership note, so the tree carries one number per rule rather than two.
The national US layer lives in ``app.modules.us_pack.config`` and owns the
things that are federal or nationwide: the specification division numbering,
the elemental classification, the owner-contractor contract families, the
progress payment application, imperial units, the federal holiday list and the
national ``US_SALES_TAX`` / ``US_USE_TAX`` reference entries. This pack does
NOT re-declare any of them, and it declares ``vat_rates`` empty for the same
reason ``us_pack`` does: there is no federal VAT, so the empty dict is the
explicit opt-out signal the cross-pack completeness check reads.

The national pack carries an indicative ``7.250`` for California under
``tax_rules.examples`` and labels it the state minimum, which it is. The
authoritative treatment - that a contractor is the consumer of what it installs
as *materials* but the retailer of what it installs as a *fixture* - lives
here, because the rate does not answer the question a California bid asks.

Every rule below carries a ``statute_reference``. That field is mandatory and
the test suite fails a rule without one: an unsourced number in a tax or
retainage field is worse than silence, because a user will price work on it.

``effective_date`` follows the convention the payment-clock table already uses
for its null deadlines - the field is always present, and ``None`` is a
statement rather than an omission. A value is an ISO date (``2026-01-01``), an
ISO year-month, or a bare year where only the year of commencement is
established. ``None`` means the provision is long-standing and its commencement
was not established when this pack was written; it never means "today".

Money and rates are strings, in line with the platform money convention.
