"""The starter rate library must survive the layers that read it silently.

Three readers take the seed data without complaining about it, so a bad row
here shows up as a wrong number on screen rather than as a failure:

* ``rate_math._normalize_kind`` treats every kind that is not exactly
  ``percentage`` as a flat amount, so a component written ``percent`` or
  ``pct`` becomes a currency amount per hour and the rate is quietly wrong;
* the ORM columns are bounded (``name`` and ``label`` at 255, ``currency`` at
  3), and an over-long literal is a database error at first boot inside a
  fail-soft seeder, which logs a warning nobody reads;
* the seeder's idempotency key is the template name, so two rows sharing a
  name would leave the second one permanently unseeded.

None of this needs a database: both the seed data and the build-up arithmetic
are module-level and pure.
