// One route, one module chip.
//
// Every playbook step carries a chip: a visible label, the i18n key that label
// is translated through, and the route the chip walks to. The chip is a
// breadcrumb into the sidebar, so two cases sending a reader to the same screen
// have to name that screen the same way. They frequently do not, and the two
// ways that fails are not the same defect:
//
//   * Two different KEYS on one route. Invisible in English whenever both keys
//     happen to render the same word, and visible in every locale where they
//     do not. This is the one that reaches a user, and no English-language
//     review can see it, which is why it needs a machine.
//   * One key under two spellings of the LABEL ('Field Time' / 'Field time').
//     No locale effect at all, because the label is only a fallback for the
//     key. Untidy source, nothing more.
//
// They are reported separately on purpose. Printing an untidy capital letter
// next to a word that comes out wrong in forty-two languages teaches the reader
// to skim both.
//
// Where the right key is disputed, the tie-break is the LIVE NAVIGATION, not
// the playbook majority: the key the sidebar itself puts on that route wins,
// because that is the word the reader sees on arrival. A majority of playbooks
// is a count of authors, not a fact about the destination.
//
// What this file checks is narrower than that tie-break, and the difference
// matters. It enforces that the chips agree with EACH OTHER. It does not
// compare them against `navCatalog.ts`, so a route where every case unanimously
// uses a key the navigation never puts there passes cleanly. Measured
// 2026-08-17 against both live surfaces: 75 routes unanimous and matching, 16
// unanimous and contradicting, 23 split, 7 on routes neither surface carries.
// Those 16 are a separate piece of work with an owner; do not read a green run
// here as "the chips agree with the sidebar".
//
// A third way it fails was invisible to this file until 2026-08-18: a chip
// whose label is not the English value of the key beside it. The three checks
// compared chips with EACH OTHER, so nothing held a label to the thing it
// actually renders, and 170 of 645 chips drifted under a green suite. That one
// reaches a reader too, on the public case pages, which take `moduleLabel` raw.
//
// The baselines below are a shrink list, not an allowlist. They record the
// splits that predate this gate so the suite is not red on arrival, and they
// are compared by exact key set: a baselined route that grows a new variant
// goes red, and so does one that gets fixed, because a fixed route has to leave
// the list. Nothing may be added to any of the three.
//
// LABEL_VALUE_BASELINE goes further and demands a reason on every line, because
// the other two record accidents while that one records decisions, and a
// decision nobody wrote down becomes permission.

 * accumulated under a green suite.
 *
 * Why it matters that the label is not dead code: every one of these keys
 * exists in `en.ts`, so `defaultValue` never fires and the label never reaches
 * the app. It reaches the public case pages, which take `moduleLabel` raw from
 * `playbookModules`. So each entry here is one screen that the site and the
 * product call by different words, and a reader clicking through from one to the
 * other has to recognise where they landed.
 *
 * The key's value wins by default: it is what the product shows, and the site
 * describes the product rather than the other way round. An entry here is a
 * claim that this pair is the exception, so it carries its reason on the line.
 * A pair with no reason fails the suite rather than passing quietly, because a
 * baseline of opaque keys hardens into permission while a baseline of reasons
 * stays a worklist.
 *
 * 139 chips across 49 pairs moved onto their key's value on 2026-08-18, and
 * those rows left this list. What remains is five rows of three kinds, and the
 * kinds matter more than the count: one deferral, two approved exceptions where
 * the literal really is the better chip text, and two entries that are not
 * label defects at all.
 *
 * That last kind is here to stay visible, not to be fixed. Each one is a
 * finding about the chip's key or its route, and moving the label would settle
 * the wording while leaving the actual defect in place and no longer reported.
 * A defect that has been made to look tidy stops being counted.
