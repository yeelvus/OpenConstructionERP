"""One country, one markup stack, whichever engine you ask.

The platform has two markup engines with two different jobs.
:func:`app.modules.boq.service._calculate_markup_amounts` prices a bill's own
markup lines; :func:`app.modules.methodology.cascade.compute_cascade` prices a
company or project methodology. Two engines with different jobs is the intended
arrangement. Two engines that answer the same question differently is not, and
that is what this file exists to prevent.

It was not hypothetical. On a million of American direct cost the bill engine
returned 1,308,150 and the methodology engine returned 1,210,000, a gap of 7.5
percent, because the methodology catalogue shipped a three-step flat method
under the name "United States" while the regional table stated the seven-line
stack an American estimator would recognise. The fix was to derive one from the
other. This file is the part that keeps it derived: it recomputes every covered
country through both paths and fails on any disagreement the two rounding
conventions do not fully explain.

What this file proves is narrower than "the two engines agree", and the gap
between those two statements is where a real defect lived. Every country here
is priced with the template's own VAT on both sides. That is one branch, the
one every project travels that never set a rate of its own, and on it the
engines agree to a rounding tail. A project that states a ``default_vat_rate``
takes the other branch: the bill has honoured that rate since issue #89 and the
methodology did not, so one bill asked two ways cost two amounts, by as much as
315,632 on a million. That half of the claim now lives in
``tests/pg/test_methodology_takes_the_projects_vat.py``, which needs stored
rows and so cannot run here. Neither file is the guarantee on its own.

Two assertions, and they catch different regressions:

* Line for line. Same count, same order, same category, same rate, same base,
  and the base is checked against the translation rule stated independently
  here rather than against whatever the producer emitted. This is the assertion
  that makes a silent divergence structurally impossible: a rate edited on one
  side alone cannot survive it.
* Total against total, within a tolerance derived from the rounding conventions
  and asserted to be orders of magnitude below the defect it must catch.

These tests touch ``BOQMarkup`` and therefore SQLAlchemy, so they live here and
not under ``tests/unit/methodology/``, which is the standalone Python 3.11 lane.
