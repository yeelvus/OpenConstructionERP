"""Unified search service - fan-out + RRF over every vector collection.

Architecture
------------

The unified search is a two-track recall system:

1. Vector track - :func:`search_collection` from :mod:`app.core.vector_index`
   embeds the query once and runs ANN over every selected collection.
   Best at semantic recall ("reinforced concrete walls" matches "RC
   wall 240mm") but requires LanceDB / Qdrant to be installed AND for
   the collections to have been indexed.

2. SQL track - :func:`_sql_search_collection` runs ILIKE substring
   matches against the canonical text columns of each collection's
   backing table. Lower recall but ALWAYS available - it's the
   fallback when LanceDB is missing (fresh ``pip install`` without
   ``[vector]`` extras) or when a collection has zero vectors.

The two tracks are merged via Reciprocal Rank Fusion. SQL hits ride
the same fusion path as vector hits, so the response shape is
identical regardless of which track produced the result. This is
IMP-016: SQL fallback is unconditional, vector adds re-rank quality
when available.
