    R7 audit (2026-05-24):
        Three new permission keys split off from the generic
        ``finance.update`` so financial commitments require MANAGER:

        * ``finance.approve`` - invoice approval (draft → sent). The
          legacy route used ``finance.update`` (EDITOR), which let any
          estimator move an invoice to a payable state.
        * ``finance.pay`` - mark invoice paid. Same rationale: paying
          an invoice is a binding financial action, not a CRUD edit.
        * ``finance.record_payment`` - recording a payment row against
          an invoice. EDITOR can no longer fabricate ledger entries.
