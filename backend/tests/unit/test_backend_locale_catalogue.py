"""Catalogue guard for backend/locales: the list and the files must agree.

Two lists decide what a backend locale is. ``SUPPORTED_LOCALES`` in
app/core/i18n.py is what every caller gates on - the Accept-Language
middleware matches against it, the /i18n routes 404 outside it - and
``LOCALE_NAMES`` is what get_available_locales() offers a user. The
translations themselves are the JSON files. Nothing kept the three in step,
and they drifted in both directions at once: bg, hr, id, ro, th and vi were
translated files no request could ever select, while mn was offered in the
language picker with no file behind it, so choosing it served English.

Neither direction is visible from a passing test suite, an HTTP 200 or a
green build, which is why it is asserted here rather than reviewed.

Three checks:

  * The two lists and the set of files on disk are the same set. Measured
    through ``LOCALES_DIR``, the same path the runtime loads from, so a move
    of the directory fails here instead of silently emptying the catalogue.

  * No locale is mostly English. A file can carry every key, parse, load and
    still be the English source text under a foreign name: bg was exactly
    that, 372 of 372 shared values byte-identical to en.json. This is the
    backend twin of scripts/check_i18n_leak_baseline.py, which only ever
    looked at the frontend. The threshold is deliberately loose - a real
    translation lands far below it, since only product names, unit symbols
    and the odd international loanword legitimately match English - so it
    accuses nothing that is merely incomplete.

  * Key coverage against en.json may not get worse. Most locales are still
    short of the full key set and are being filled, so this is declared debt
    rather than a hard equality, recorded per locale in
    scripts/i18n_backend_coverage_baseline.json. That file may only shrink.
    Alongside the count each locale carries a digest of its missing keys,
    compared only when the count is unchanged: without it a locale could
    drop one key and fill another and stay green on an unmoved number.

  * No locale answers a question en.json did not ask. The coverage check above
    runs one way only, and is blind in the other by construction: asking
    whether every English key is present can never notice a locale carrying
    keys English does not have. ar.json held twelve such keys and ru.json four,
    for months, through every gate we had. The two directions get separate
    assertions and separate messages on purpose, because a locale short of a
    key and a locale carrying a spare one are opposite faults with opposite
    fixes, and one symmetric message for both would obscure which had happened.

  * Placeholders survive translation. ``t()`` runs str.format over the value,
    so the braces are code and not text. It catches KeyError and ValueError,
    which makes a renamed field degrade to the untouched string, but it does
    not catch IndexError, so a stray ``{}`` or ``{0}`` anywhere in a locale is
    a 500 on the route that renders it.

    to keep only until someone reads the file and concludes the platform
    supports something it does not.

    Two kinds turned up when this was first measured. Plural variants (_few,
    _many, _two, _zero), and keys copied in from the frontend catalogue, which
    is a separate and much larger key set that this side never renders.

    The plural case needs stating carefully, because the obvious argument is
    too strong. Backend t() is a flat dictionary lookup with no plural
    resolution, so t() itself can never select a _few. But t() is not the only
    reader: app/core/i18n_router.py serves this catalogue over GET
    /i18n/{locale}, shaped for an i18next-style client, and i18next does
    resolve plurals. So the forms are unreachable because no such consumer
    exists - this product's frontend carries its own boq.mvp keys and does not
    fetch that route - and not because the shape is meaningless. If an external
    i18next client ever becomes a real consumer, the deleted Arabic and Russian
