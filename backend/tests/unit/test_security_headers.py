"""Tests for SecurityHeadersMiddleware.

We pin two things:
  1. The middleware actually emits the headers we claim it does (the
     headline defensive set: X-Frame-Options, CSP, HSTS-on-https, etc.).
  2. The CSP includes the key directives we depend on — frame-ancestors
     'none', no third-party script-src besides the analytics whitelist,
     etc. — so a future "let's relax CSP" change is a deliberate edit
     to this test, not a silent regression.

The middleware is the SOURCE OF TRUTH for CSP — nginx no longer adds
its own CSP header (see deploy/docker/nginx.conf), so this test is
the only enforcement point.
