"""Pin every column that points at a document without the database enforcing it.

Thirty-four columns across twenty-one modules hold a document id that no
foreign key constrains. Six other document columns do carry one, so the
unconstrained ones are a choice made repeatedly rather than a convention the
codebase lacks: the usual reason given in the comments is portability, a
``String(36)`` being safe across PostgreSQL and SQLite without a FK.

What makes the set worth pinning is the delete path. ``delete_document``
(``documents/service.py``) removes the row unconditionally. It looks up the
document, records an activity row, calls ``repo.delete`` and unlinks the file.
It never asks whether anything still points at the id, and there is no
in_use/referenced/reference-count check anywhere in the module. Afterwards it
publishes ``documents.document.deleted`` detached, and exactly three
subscribers exist for that name: the documents module's own handler, the
file_search indexer and the file_references purger. None of those three owns
any of the thirty-four columns below.

One consumer is handled, and how it is handled is the strongest evidence that
the gap is real. ``takeoff`` has its blobs preserved by a direct call placed
inline in the delete path, and the comment there says why it is not driven off
the event: the publish is detached, so a subscriber would race the unlink and
lose nondeterministically, passing on a developer's box and failing on a
loaded one. That reasoning applies to all thirty-three other referrers equally.
They just have nobody calling for them.

So deleting a document leaves dangling ids in up to thirty-three places, and
the user is asked to confirm with a dialog whose entire text is "Delete?".

This gate does not fix that. Adding a reference-count endpoint spanning these
tables and a warning dialog naming what would break is a scoped piece of work,
and the decision about how hard to block a delete is a product one. What the
gate does is stop the set growing silently, and give that work a census to
start from. It fails in both directions: a new unconstrained document
reference fails here, and one that gains a foreign key or is removed fails
here too, so the list can never outlive what it describes.
