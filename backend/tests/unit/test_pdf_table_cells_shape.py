"""A bare table cell prints complex script correctly, not merely visibly.

``pdf_table_font_commands`` gives a cell the right face. It cannot give it the
right shape, because reportlab draws a cell that is not a flowable through
``canvas.drawString``, and that call discards its shaping argument unless
``rlbidi`` is installed. So a Thai tone mark in a plain cell drew at the height
of the vowel it belongs above and merged with it, and a Devanagari i-matra drew
after its consonant instead of before: the right characters in the wrong
arrangement, which looks like output and is not.

``pdf_table_shaped_rows`` shapes the text before the table ever sees it, so the
cell holds the glyphs the shaper chose and the draw call has nothing left to do.

Two properties pull against each other here and both are asserted below. The
shaped cells have to actually change what lands on the page, and every other
cell has to be untouched, by identity rather than by comparison. The second is
not a formality: handing Latin to the shaper applies its ligatures, so a version
of this that shaped every cell would rewrite English documents and move their
column widths while appearing to be a Thai fix.
