/**
 * The one place that answers "in what order does this reader expect names".
 *
 * Sorting text is language-dependent and JavaScript's defaults are not.
 * `['Zebra', 'Ärger'].sort()` puts the umlaut last because it compares UTF-16
 * code units, and a German reader looks for that word under A. Swedish, Danish
 * and Norwegian want the opposite: there Ä and Ö are their own letters at the
 * END of the alphabet, so the German answer is wrong for them and theirs is
 * wrong for German. Czech sorts `ch` as one letter after `h`. Turkish has a
 * dotless i with its own casing. For Chinese a code-unit order is not an order
 * a reader can scan at all.
 *
 * `String.prototype.localeCompare(other)` with no locale argument is only
 * half a fix. It sorts in the RUNTIME's default locale, which in a browser
 * comes from the browser and OS, not from the language this app is set to.
 * A reader who picked Swedish in our language picker while running an English
 * browser gets English collation on Swedish names. This module closes that
 * gap by always naming the locale, and it takes that locale from the same
 * place the rest of the UI does, so there is one answer to audit.
 *
 * Why a cache. `new Intl.Collator(...)` is expensive to construct and a
 * comparator runs O(n log n) times per sort, so building one per comparison
 * (which is what a bare `localeCompare` call inside a sort does) is a real
 * cost on a long list. The collators here are built once per locale and
 * reused, which is both the fast path and the correct one.
