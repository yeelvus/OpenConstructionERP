"""Field Diary event publishers - feed diary labour into cost / payroll.

When a diary entry is submitted, the work activities it carries (each with
an ``hours`` figure) are a labour signal just like a field report's
workforce log. We publish the *same* canonical
``fieldreports.labour.logged`` event so the cost model and payroll
subscribers have a single code path to roll labour hours up against the
budget and into a draft pay batch.

Auto-imported by the module loader when ``oe_field_diary`` loads.
