"""A pid file left by a killed postmaster used to protect its data dir forever.

The reaper removed a throwaway cluster only when its directory had no
``postmaster.pid`` at all, on the reasoning that a pid file means somebody is
serving out of that directory. That covers a live session and a session whose
postmaster is still up, and both of those do have a live postmaster. It does
not cover the third case, which is the one that accumulates: a postmaster that
was force-killed leaves its pid file behind and nothing comes back to remove
it, so the directory is excluded from reaping for good.

Measured on this machine at the time of writing, eleven directories were being
held out of reach by pid files naming processes that no longer existed, and
the suite's own warning was reporting them as clusters still running.

What these tests pin is narrow and deliberate. The reaper must ask
``embedded_pg._pidfile_owner_is_live`` rather than test liveness itself: that
function answers yes when it cannot tell and treats a pid that is alive but
belongs to something else as gone, and a bare ``pid in os.listdir('/proc')``
style check gets the second one wrong on Windows often enough to matter. So
one test asserts the answer is acted on and another asserts the question is
asked of that function, about the directory the pid file is actually in.
