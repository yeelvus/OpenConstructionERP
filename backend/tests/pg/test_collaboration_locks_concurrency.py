"""PG contract tests for ``collaboration_locks``: races, expiry, and ownership.

The module had zero coverage. Its whole purpose is arbitrating between two
people who reach for the same row at the same moment, so the interesting
behaviour only exists under real concurrency: the ``acquire`` fast path, the
``IntegrityError`` recovery after losing the unique constraint, takeover of an
expired lock, and the holder-only gate on heartbeat / release.

Why this lane
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
``uq_collab_lock_entity`` is what makes ``acquire`` safe, and only a real
PostgreSQL cluster raises on it the way production does. ``tests/pg`` is also
the single suite the *CI (PostgreSQL)* workflow runs, so a regression here
blocks a merge.

Two isolation styles are used deliberately:

* ``pg_session`` (savepoint-isolated) for everything single-connection.
* ``committed_locks`` for the genuine two-connection races. The savepoint
  fixture cannot express those: a second connection never sees its uncommitted
  rows, and ``repository.acquire`` calls ``session.rollback()`` on conflict,
  which on a savepoint-joined session would unwind the seeded fixture data
  along with the failed INSERT.

Clock handling: expiry is driven through the explicit ``now`` argument the
repository already takes, and by seeding locks with a non-positive
``ttl_seconds`` (neither the service nor the repository re-validates the
Pydantic bounds). Nothing here sleeps.
