"""Defects-liability service layer (post-handover warranty and DLP register).

Async data access on top of the module's own two tables plus the read-side
loaders that project persisted rows onto the pure
:class:`app.modules.defects_liability.register.WarrantyRow` list fed to the
computation core. A defect is only ever created, listed or mutated after its
parent warranty is confirmed to belong to the same project
(:meth:`_require_warranty_in_project`), so a defect can never be attached across
projects even when the caller is authorised on their own project - the
defense-in-depth companion to the router's :func:`verify_project_access` gate.

The limitation regime is opt-in and this layer is where that is enforced.
:func:`_apply_derived_period` runs only when the caller's own payload named a
regime, and :meth:`DefectsLiabilityService.review_limitation_periods` looks only
at entries that carry one. Every other path through this file behaves for a
regime-free entry exactly as it did before the column existed.
