    """Weekday numbers for every entry that names one, warning about the rest.

    The ``work_days`` counterpart to :func:`readable_exception_dates`, and it
    exists for a sharper reason than symmetry. Every reader of this column used
    to wrap the whole conversion in ``except (TypeError, ValueError)`` and fall
    back to a default week, which is ornamental against the malformation that
    actually happens. A bare digit string does not raise. ``"12345"`` iterates
    character by character into ``[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]``, a clean five day week
    nobody would look at twice, and ``"0123456"`` into a seven day week in which
    no date is ever non-working, so every duration computes short and every
    finish date lands early. Junk that is indistinguishable from a correct
    answer is worse than junk that looks like junk.

    So the guard cannot be an except around the iteration. It has to be a type
    check on the column before anything iterates it.

    A column that is not a list is refused, for the same reason the holiday
    column is: what separates the two cases is history, not blast radius. A
    malformed entry had a legitimate way in until the write guards landed. A
    non-list column never did, because this is ``JSON`` with ``nullable=False``,
    ``default=list`` and a ``[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`` server default, and every write
    path goes through a schema typed as a list.

    An empty list stays lenient and is returned as one, because ``default=list``
    means an ORM-created row with no explicit work days genuinely arrives as
    ``[]``. Callers apply their own default to that. It is deliberately not
    folded together with the refusal above: an empty week and an unreadable
    column must not reach the same line, or the collapse this removes is simply
    rebuilt one level up.

    Entries are dropped individually rather than taking the column down with
    them, which is the other half of what the blanket except cost. One
    unreadable entry used to discard every readable one beside it and silently
    substitute the default week.

    Values outside Monday zero to Sunday six are passed through rather than
    dropped. A weekday number nothing matches is inert, it simply never marks a
    day as working, so dropping it would change dates where keeping it cannot.
    The write side owns that range check.

    Args:
        work_days: The stored column, in any spelling.
        source: What is being read, named in every warning so the log says which

def readable_exception_dates(exceptions: object, *, source: str) -> list[str]:
    """Canonical dates for every entry that names a day, warning about the rest.

    The read-path counterpart to :func:`canonical_exception_dates`, and the one
    convention every reader of a stored calendar now shares.

    There used to be four. One reader truncated each entry to ten characters,
    one passed it through whole, one truncated it again somewhere else, and the
    only parser that actually validated had no production callers. They
    disagreed about which values meant which day, so the same stored holiday
    could be read three ways in one request.

    Worse than disagreeing, three of them could not report. A truncation has no
    failure mode, so there was no error branch to log from: a holiday written
    ``01/05/2026`` matched no date, the day was worked as an ordinary one, and
    nothing anywhere said so. That is the same blindness as a swallowed
    exception, arriving by a route where there is not even a place to put the
    log line.

    A single unreadable *entry* is dropped rather than refused, unlike the
    write-side check, and the asymmetry is deliberate. The write schemas turn
    away a value naming no single day, so anything malformed arriving here was
    stored before those guards existed. Refusing it now would turn an old row
    into a failed read on a path nobody asked to change, and would hide the very
    calendar an operator needs to see in order to fix it.

    A column that is not a list at all is refused, and the difference from the
    line above is not a matter of degree. One bad entry loses one day. A column
    that is not a calendar loses every holiday in it, and the caller cannot tell,
    because a schedule computed from no holidays looks exactly like a schedule
    computed from a calendar that happened to have none. A log line is not
    visible to whoever reads the finish date, and these dates are planned
    against.

    The reason that does not contradict the leniency above is that the two cases
    have different populations. Malformed entries have a legitimate history: they
    were storable until the write guards landed. A non-list has none. The column
    is ``JSON`` with ``nullable=False``, ``default=list`` and a ``[]`` server
    default, and every write path in the tree goes through a schema typed as a
    list, so no version of this code could ever have stored one. Reaching this
    branch means the row was written around the application, and degrading
    quietly is the wrong answer to data nothing we ship can produce.

    ``None`` is not in that category and is read as an empty calendar. The
    column cannot be NULL, and where a caller passes ``None`` it means there is
    no calendar rather than an unreadable one.

    Empty entries are dropped silently, also deliberately. They carry no date to
    misread, and a stored blank would otherwise warn on every reschedule for the
    life of the row.

    Args:
        exceptions: Stored exception or holiday values, in any spelling.
        source: What is being read. It is named in every warning, so the log
            says which calendar to correct rather than only that something
            somewhere was unreadable.

        Canonical ``YYYY-MM-DD`` strings for the entries that name a day, in the
