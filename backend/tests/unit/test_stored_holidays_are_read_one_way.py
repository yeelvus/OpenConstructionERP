"""Every reader of a stored calendar reads a holiday the same way, and says so.

There used to be four conventions for the same stored column. One reader
truncated each entry to ten characters, one passed it through whole, one
truncated it again elsewhere, and the only parser that validated had no
production callers. A holiday written ``01/05/2026`` was worked as an ordinary
day by all of them, and because a truncation has no failure mode, none of them
logged anything about it.

Two properties are asserted here and they are different properties. That the
readers agree, which is what makes one stored value mean one thing. And that an
unreadable entry is reported, which is what makes the disagreement findable at
all rather than showing up as a schedule that is quietly one day out.
