"""Integration tests for the project-member endpoints used by the Team Strip.

Covers the three endpoints registered on the ``oe_projects`` router:

    GET    /api/v1/projects/{project_id}/members/
    POST   /api/v1/projects/{project_id}/members/
    DELETE /api/v1/projects/{project_id}/members/{user_id}/

Test matrix:

    * owner can list / add / remove
    * a user with no access gets 404 on the read (``_verify_project_access``,
      so the status code never confirms that a project UUID exists) and 403
      on the writes (``_verify_project_owner``, whose usual caller is a
      member who already knows the project is there)
    * cannot add the same user twice (409)
    * cannot remove the project owner (400)

Uses the PostgreSQL isolation pattern from ``feedback_test_isolation.md``.
