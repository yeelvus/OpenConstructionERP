"""Cases module validation rules.

A case scenario is teaching material, and the ways it goes wrong are not syntax
errors: it opens screens without saying why, it claims five minutes for twenty
steps, it walks the same page three times. None of that stops a case being
saved, and none of it can be caught by a schema.

So the rules run on save and the findings come back with the saved case, and
they are a **gate on one action only**: publishing. A private draft may be as
rough as its author likes. Sharing a case with the team is a claim that it is
worth someone's time, and an ERROR finding contradicts that claim.

Rules, all registered under the ``cases`` rule set:

* ``cases.has_steps``         - ERROR.   A case with no steps teaches nothing.
* ``cases.step_titled``       - ERROR.   Every step needs a title and a target.
* ``cases.step_purpose``      - WARNING. A step with no "why" is a click
                                          instruction, not a walkthrough.
* ``cases.distinct_screens``  - WARNING. Consecutive steps on the same screen
                                          read as one step to the follower.
* ``cases.duration_plausible``- WARNING. The stated minutes should survive
                                          contact with the step count.
* ``cases.described``         - WARNING. A case needs a summary to be findable.

    That finding is the point. This used to return an empty list, which is the
    same value a case gets when it has been checked and nothing is wrong, so
    one value carried two meanings and no caller could tell them apart. A case
    nobody had been able to validate therefore passed the publish gate looking
    exactly like a clean one. Validation is not optional here, and being unable
    to run it is a reason to withhold publication rather than to grant it.

    The row is DIAGNOSTIC because it records an infrastructure failure and not
    something wrong with the case, and ERROR because it must stop the case
    being shared. It deliberately does not set ``is_engine_error``: that flag
    marks rows which are reported alongside a verdict without changing it, and
    this row is the verdict.

    The other half of that sentence is the rows which *do* carry the flag: one
    rule crashing while the rest ran. They are returned too. This used to end
    ``and not result.is_engine_error``, which is the right idiom for a list
    feeding a gate and the wrong one here, because this single list is also
    everything the author is ever shown. A case where a check crashed came back
    looking exactly like a case where every check ran and found nothing, and
    the rule that failed was the one worth reading about. They keep the INFO
    severity the engine gave them, so they inform the author without changing
