"""Section headers must not be convicted of missing a leaf-row attribute.

A section header aggregates its children. By construction it carries no
unit, no quantity, no rate and no classification code: those live on the
leaf rows underneath it. A rule that demands a leaf-level code and then
walks every row therefore convicts every header in the tree, and on a
deep bill the false findings outnumber the real ones.

Two directions are asserted here, because only one of them is obvious.

Forwards: the rules listed in ``NARROWED`` must not fire on a section
row. That is the fix.

Backwards: the rules listed in ``STILL_JUDGE_SECTIONS`` must keep firing
on one, and each carries a payload proving it. Narrowing a rule silences
it on every header, and a rule that stopped firing looks exactly like a
rule that passed. Those eight judge something a header genuinely has -
a title, an ordinal, a sign, an arithmetic identity, a currency, or a
classification code it chose to carry - so narrowing them would trade a
false positive for a false negative.

Section detection has two branches (``_get_leaf_positions``): an
explicit ``type`` field, and the parent_id graph for the seed and import
paths that never stamp one. Both are exercised, because a hand-rolled
guard that covers only the explicit branch passes a test that only
exercises the explicit branch.

THE REGISTRY SWEEP at the bottom runs in an interpreter of its own. The
rule registry is a process-global object filled by import side effects,
so read in-process it holds whatever the session happened to load, and
the sweep's subject changed with test ordering. See the comment above it
for the measurements and for what the stated load set covers.

# ── Registry-wide, so a rule added later cannot reintroduce this ─────────
#
# WHY THIS RUNS IN AN INTERPRETER OF ITS OWN. ``rule_registry`` is a single
# process-global object filled by import side effects: ``register_builtin_rules``
# puts the built-ins in it, and every ``app/modules/*/validators.py`` adds its
# own rules the moment anything imports that module. Read in-process, it holds
# whatever the session happened to load, and nothing here decides that. Measured
# on this tree, this file alone saw 125 rules; with the module validators
# imported, 165; and in two sessions where an earlier test had already built a
# FastAPI app, 251 and 297. The sweep used to read that global directly, so its
# subject was up to 172 rules wider or narrower depending on what ran before it,
# and two sessions of the same kind did not even agree with each other. A rule
# that convicts a header would then be caught in one order and missed in another
# on the same tree, and the green run and the red run would be equally honest,
# which is the same as saying neither measured anything.
#
# Pinning the order or resetting the registry between tests would only hold until
# somebody adds a test, so the process history is removed instead: the sweep
# starts a clean interpreter, loads a stated set, and answers from that. Its
# verdict is a property of the tree and of nothing else.
#
# WHAT THE STATED SET COVERS, written down because an unstated boundary gets
# exceeded by the next reader: the built-in rules, every ``validators.py`` under
# ``app/modules``, and every ``register_*_rules`` hook those modules expose. The
# hooks are not optional decoration. A module registers its rules one of two
# ways, at import or from its ``on_startup`` hook, and importing alone reaches
# only the first kind - it leaves ``design_options`` and thirty-three others
# with no rule in the registry at all. Loading both ways is what makes this
# sweep's subject the same size as the one a booted application has. What is
# still outside it is a rule set installed at runtime from a partner pack, and
# a rule registered from a router or a service rather than from ``validators``.
