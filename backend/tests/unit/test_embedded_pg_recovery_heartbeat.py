"""A slow crash recovery has to keep saying that it is still recovering.

Why this is worth a test of its own: the desktop launcher gives up on a backend
that has written nothing for a few minutes, and that limit is only safe because
the longest legitimately quiet step - waiting out a write-ahead-log replay -
reports itself while it waits. Without the heartbeat the launcher would have to
keep its old, useless rule of waiting out the whole twenty-minute window.

So this pins the contract the two sides share: while the cluster is not
answering, ``pg`` / ``progress`` markers keep coming.
