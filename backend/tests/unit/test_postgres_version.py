# DDC-CWICR-OE: DataDrivenConstruction - OpenConstructionERP
"""Startup version check, against the PostgreSQL the suite actually runs on.

The stub-driven branch coverage lives in ``test_postgres_version_errors``. What
only a real server can answer is here:

* that ``SELECT current_setting('server_version_num')`` is executable over the
  driver we ship (a stub proves the parsing, never the wire), and
* that the check accepts the cluster the rest of the suite depends on, and
  rejects it the moment the requirement is raised above it.

``tests._pg.isolated_engine`` hands out a throwaway database on that same
cluster. The ``tests/pg`` tree is deliberately not used: its conftest skips the
whole tree unless ``OE_TEST_DB=pg``, so a check that must hold on every run
cannot live there.
