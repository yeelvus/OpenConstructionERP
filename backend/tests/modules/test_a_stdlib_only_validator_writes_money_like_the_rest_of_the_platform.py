"""The two dependency-free validator modules write money the way everything else does.

``procurement/validators.py`` and ``subcontractors/validators.py`` declare
themselves standard-library-only in their docstrings and mean it, so until
``app.core.currency_registry`` existed they could not ask how many decimals a
currency keeps: ``minor_units`` sat behind ``app.core.money``, which imports
pydantic and SQLAlchemy at module level. Both wrote every amount with a
hardcoded two decimals and no currency code at all.

Two decimals is wrong in two directions, and the tests below pin both. It is too
many for a currency with no subunit, which is why JPY and IDR are named here
explicitly: the platform has a standing decision that both keep zero, recorded
in ``app.core.currency_registry`` beside the table and pinned across all three
resolvers in ``tests/unit/test_every_money_resolver_asks_the_same_registry.py``.
It is too few for the Gulf dinars. A local ``,.2f`` in these modules would have
disagreed with ``_fmt_money`` on every one of those codes, which is the specific
way a second spelling of one idea goes wrong: never on the currency the author
tested with.

The contract itself is tested rather than trusted. A docstring saying "no
dependencies" is one careless import away from being untrue and nothing goes red
when it stops being so, so :class:`TestTheCurrencyRegistryIsStandardLibraryOnly`
runs a fresh interpreter and asks it what got imported.

What stays bare is pinned as hard as what changed: the retention templates glue
``%`` straight onto the slot, so an amount rendered there would read
``50.00 EUR%``. Those two messages are percentages, not money, and the tests
below fail if a later sweep converts them.
