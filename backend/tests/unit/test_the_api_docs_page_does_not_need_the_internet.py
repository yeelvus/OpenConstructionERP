"""Both API reference pages have to render with no way out to the internet.

FastAPI's stock routes write pages that fetch their application code from
``cdn.jsdelivr.net``: ``swagger-ui-bundle.js`` and ``swagger-ui.css`` for
``/api/docs``, ``redoc.standalone.js`` for ``/api/redoc``. Both also take a
favicon from ``fastapi.tiangolo.com``, and ReDoc additionally asks
``fonts.googleapis.com`` for Montserrat and Roboto. On a machine with outbound
access that is invisible. On an air-gapped site, or a VPS behind an egress
firewall, the shell arrives, the browser cannot fetch the files that turn it
into a reference, and the operator gets a blank page with no error to search
for. Self-hosting is the premise of this platform rather than an edge case, so
the assets ship in the wheel and the pages point at this install.

The test that matters here is not "the HTML changed". It is that the URLs the
pages name are actually served, which is why every vendored asset is requested
and its bytes checked. Asserting only on the absence of the CDN string would
stay green if the vendored files were dropped from the package, and that
failure mode - a page referring to local files that are not there - looks
exactly like the bug this replaced.

``/api/docs`` is also the one thing on the API surface a first-time operator is
told to open: the boot banner prints it under "Open in your browser". A blank
page there is the first impression.

What this does not prove, said here rather than left for somebody to find in a
network log: ReDoc's own bundle renders an ``<img>`` for the Redocly mark at
``cdn.redoc.ly``. It is hidden by the component's ``onError`` handler, so the
page is complete without it, but it is one request that leaves the machine and
no assertion over the served HTML can see it. Suppressing it would mean
writing the page by hand instead of calling ``get_redoc_html``, or editing a
vendored bundle. Nothing else in either page reaches off the host, including
fonts - the bundles carry their own styles.

    these files rather than shrinking them; they are here to catch a truncation,
