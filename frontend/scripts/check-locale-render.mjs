/**
 * Ask real i18next what a non-English reader actually sees, using the shipped
 * dictionaries rather than a fixture.
 *
 * Why this exists. Principle 2 of this project is "i18n everywhere, zero
 * hardcoded strings" and it is nominally a blocker. Two measurements showed it
 * was gated by nothing at all. In the first, 30,964 `t()` calls across 912
 * files were rewritten into bare literals and the whole suite stayed 91 of 91
 * green, because the harness mock in src/test/setup.ts returns `defaultValue`
 * verbatim and roughly 95 percent of call sites pass one, so the rendered DOM
 * is byte identical whether translation works or not. In the second, every one
 * of the 38,895 German values was corrupted with placeholders preserved and
 * exactly one assertion turned red, in a file nothing runs before merge.
 *
 * The two tests that do raise real i18next, both `i18nStartupLocaleGate` files,
 * deliberately substitute a three key fixture for the dictionary, with a
 * reasoned comment saying so: a 3 MB object literal through the vitest
 * transform stalls the worker. That reasoning is sound for what those tests
 * assert, which is boot ordering. It also means the shipped dictionary is never
 * on the other end of a real `t()` call anywhere in this repo. Formatting is
 * gated, three guards raise real i18next and do pin locale dependent number and
 * date formatting. Translation is not.
 *
 * So this guard does not bring its own idea of what a translation should say.
 * It builds a real i18next instance with the application's own init options,
 * hands it every bundle under src/app/locales, and asks it to render. What it
 * asserts is a property of the answer, never a judgement of the wording:
 *
 *   1. A locale that is offered may not render blank where English renders
 *      text. That is not a quality opinion, it is a reader looking at nothing.
 *
 *   2. A locale that is offered may not come back mostly English. Measured
 *      here, not guessed: see ENGLISH_RENDER_CEILING.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT a translation quality check. Comparing each value against
 * English and judging it would fire on every string that is identical on
 * purpose, and there are thousands of those - "OK", "Email", "BOQ", unit codes,
 * proper nouns, format names. A guard with a large false positive population is
 * suppressed inside a week, and it is worse than no guard because it also looks
 * like coverage. Per string English leaks are already
 * scripts/check_i18n_leak_baseline.py's job, which finds them by uniformity
 * across locales. That fingerprint is blind by construction to one locale going
 * English on its own, which is the case measured above and the case here.
 *
 * What this guard does not cover, stated so nobody builds on more than it
 * gives. It reads dictionaries, so the first measurement is outside it: 30,964
 * `t()` calls rewritten to literals never touches a locale file, and that
 * failure lives at the call site and in the harness mock. It also cannot tell
 * German from non-English nonsense, so a value corrupted into gibberish that is
 * not English still passes. It closes missing translation and English
 * passthrough in the shipped dictionary, and nothing wider.
 *
 * Counting. Nothing here is a written down list of keys or locales. The keys
 * are whatever en.ts declares, the locales are whatever the directory holds
 * intersected with SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES in src/app/i18n.ts, and a regional
 * variant's base is derived from its own code. A number in a comment is a claim
 * nobody re-checks, and this repo has already paid for mirrored lists twice:
 * src/app/i18n-fallbacks.ts is maintained by hand and Kyrgyz, Greek and
 * Ukrainian each shipped invisible to every test that iterates it.
 *
 * Overlays. es-MX, es-CL, es-CO, pt-BR and en-US carry only the words that
 * differ from their base, so a key absent from one of them is not missing, it
 * is inherited. This guard never has to encode that rule, because it asks
 * i18next, and i18next expands a two part code into ['es-MX', 'es', 'en'] on
 * its own. Counting an overlay's absent keys as holes once printed 25,280
 * errors against a 1,499 key file. CONTROL B below proves the chain is live
 * rather than assuming it.
 *
 * Placeholders. Text inside {{ }} is code, not prose, and is never treated as
 * translatable content here. It is not touched at all: values are compared and
 * measured whole, and placeholder contracts are
 * scripts/check_i18n_placeholder_parity.py's job.
 *
 * Reading the dictionary. This does not bring its own parser either. It asks
 * the TypeScript compiler, the same reader whose opinion decides whether the
 * application builds, and takes the decoded text of each string literal, which
 * is the byte sequence i18next would receive. A locale file that does not parse,
 * or that holds anything other than plain string properties, is a refusal and
 * not a pass: a reader that silently drops entries would report a green result
 * over missing data.
 *
 * Run:
 *   node scripts/check-locale-render.mjs                 # the shipped tree
 *   node scripts/check-locale-render.mjs --selftest      # prove it can fail
 *   node scripts/check-locale-render.mjs <locale-dir>    # aim it elsewhere
 *
 * Exit 0 clean, 1 a finding, 2 the run itself is not trustworthy.
