"""An export that does not fit the paper must still be entirely on the paper.

Two generators built their tables without ``colWidths``, so reportlab sized the
columns to their content and the table simply grew. It did not refuse and it did
not shrink: ``doc.build`` returned a path and a byte count, and the columns that
did not fit were drawn past the edge of the sheet. Nothing was raised and nothing
was logged.

**These assertions are about coordinates on the page, deliberately.** The obvious
check, that a text extractor can still find every column, passed for the whole
life of this defect while the data sat off the paper, because extraction reads
the file and a reader reads the page. An export that loses its right hand columns
looks finished, which is what makes it worse than the visible kind of overflow:
nobody is prompted to check. A test that concluded "all columns present,
therefore fine" would be repeating the original mistake in assertion form.

The opposite mistake is available too, and one test here exists only to catch it.
Making a table fit by dividing the frame between its columns puts every column on
the page and can still leave a page nobody can read, at which point these
coordinate assertions would pass on a broken export. So the wide case also asserts
a floor under the column width and that a word survives whole.
