"""The US pack's ``measurement_system`` has to decide a real validation outcome.

``BOQUnitSystemConsistencyRule`` has always been able to flag a bill whose
units belong to the other measurement system, and it has always read that
system from ``data["project_unit_system"]``. Nothing in the application ever
wrote that key, so on every real run the rule read ``None`` and returned an
empty result list - registered, enabled, and unreachable. On the other side of
the same gap, ``us_pack`` declared ``"measurement_system": "imperial"`` and no
code read it.

These tests join the two through the production path only. They call
``ValidationModuleService.run_validation`` against rows in the database, so a
regression that unhooks the resolver makes them fail; a test that built a
``ValidationContext`` by hand would have passed before the wiring existed.

The controls matter as much as the positive case. The same metric bill is
validated under a German project, where metric is correct and the rule passes,
and the imperial bill is validated there too, where the rule flags exactly the
units the US project accepted. That is what proves the pack's *value* selects
the outcome rather than its mere presence. A third project sits in a country no
pack claims, and there the rule stays silent - the pre-wiring behaviour, kept
for every market without a pack.
