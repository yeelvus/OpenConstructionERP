# DDC-CWICR-OE: DataDrivenConstruction - OpenConstructionERP
"""The daily diary seeder must run at boot, and must run once per project.

The seeder was written complete and then never referenced by anything, so the
module shipped with an empty register on every install while the code that
would have filled it sat in the tree looking finished. Nothing could see it: an
unreferenced seeder imports cleanly, passes lint, and a module with no rows
renders exactly as correctly as a module whose seeder was never written.

Two failures are pinned here rather than one, because wiring it introduces the
second. The seeder had no duplicate guard at all, and the boot backfill re-runs
the list on every start, so a naive wiring adds ninety days of diaries per
project per restart. The guard has to be per project as well: a table-wide count
would be satisfied by the first project seeded, or by one diary a real user
wrote, and every remaining project would stay empty.
