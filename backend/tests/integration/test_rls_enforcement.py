"""Database-level row-level-security enforcement (RLS Phase 2+).

The suite in ``test_tenant_isolation.py`` pins the *app-layer* tenant guards at
the HTTP boundary. This suite pins the *database* backstop underneath them: when
``settings.rls_enforce`` is on, a query that runs as the non-superuser runtime
role ``oe_app`` cannot see, change or delete another tenant's rows even when it
carries no ``WHERE tenant_id`` filter at all. That is the whole point of RLS -
it catches the forgotten filter the app layer relies on.

Why a probe table instead of a real model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The isolation guarantee lives in two reusable pieces of production code:

* the runtime role + grants created by ``provision_rls`` / ``apply_rls``;
* the exact policy SQL emitted by ``rls_setup._policy_statements``.

This suite provisions the real roles, then applies that same real policy SQL to
a throwaway ``_rls_probe`` table and drives raw SQL against it. That exercises
the genuine role mechanism and the genuine policy predicate without coupling the
assertions to any one model's NOT NULL columns, and without leaving RLS enabled
on a real table for later suites. The app's ``after_begin`` listener (installed
on the shared session factory) does the ``SET LOCAL ROLE oe_app`` + GUC stamp
exactly as it does in a real request.

Boot context
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
``conftest`` binds the engine to a PostgreSQL cluster whose connecting role is
the superuser ``postgres`` (embedded ``initdb -U postgres``; the CI service
container likewise). A superuser bypasses every policy, so the policies this
module installs stay inert for every other suite - which is exactly why RLS is
safe to enable globally only behind the flag + an explicit role downgrade.
