"""The contracts findings exist for every key the source can ask for.

``translate`` falls back to English and then to the raw key, so a missing
message never raises: it shows up as ``pay_application.period_gap.fail``
printed to a project accountant. The keys are read out of the rule and service
source rather than listed here, so a rule that starts emitting a new message is
covered the day it is written.

The bundle ships in English, German and Russian first. The other languages
arrive in one pass once the billing rules stop gaining keys; until then the
test that wants every language is a strict expected failure, so it turns red
the day the translations land and has to be switched on rather than forgotten.
