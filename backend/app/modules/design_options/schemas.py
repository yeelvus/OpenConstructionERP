"""Pydantic request/response schemas for the Design Options module.

Base request/response shapes for design-option sets and the individual options
inside them. The side-by-side comparison shapes (per-option columns, by-trade
delta rows, the recommendation and the fairness banner) are appended by the
comparison phase at the clearly marked section at the end of this file.

Monetary, quantity and ratio values follow the platform contract: they are
Decimal in Python and stored / sent as plain decimal *strings* so large totals
round-trip without binary-float drift and stay locale-neutral. The option ORM
columns are already strings, so these read schemas type them as ``str`` and no
float ever appears on the wire.
