# DDC-CWICR-OE: DataDrivenConstruction · OpenConstructionERP
"""Install the flagship "Residential House" reference project.

Unlike the SQLite-only showcase snapshot, this installer is ORM-based and
therefore dialect-agnostic (works on the embedded-PostgreSQL default AND on
SQLite). It restores a real CAD-to-BOQ project from committed assets:

    app/scripts/flagship_assets/flagship.json        spec (built by _bake_flagship.py)
    app/scripts/flagship_assets/geometry_{ifc,rvt}.dae.gz   real DDC geometry
    app/scripts/flagship_assets/house_plans.pdf      reference plan set

It creates: the project (+ WGS84 geo anchor so it shows on the map), the IFC
and RVT BIM 3D models with their real converted elements and geometry, a DWG
drawing entry in the dedicated DWG Takeoff module (never the BIM 3D Hub, since
a 2D drawing has no mesh), a costed BOQ whose positions carry real CWICR rates +
material/labour/equipment resource breakdowns, BIM<->BOQ links for every
element in each priced group (bidirectional navigation), project resources,
and the PDF plan set.

All ids are derived deterministically so re-running is idempotent and a later
showcase export references the same rows.

# Founding principle: every BOQ position we ship carries a resource buildup. The flagship positions ship raw CWICR

# row cost, not to the position's converted unit_rate. The BOQ resource
# contract (boq/service.py) treats every leaf's ``unit_rate`` as a PER-UNIT
# norm and re-derives the position rate as Sum(leaf.quantity * leaf.unit_rate);
# for that to stay consistent the buildup must sum EXACTLY to the position
# unit_rate. So we keep the real component names/codes/types but scale every
# leaf by one deterministic factor so the buildup sums to the unit_rate, and

    Runs *after* ``install_flagship`` has committed, deliberately, and commits

    modules then read from their own sessions - the NCR bridge raises an NCR
    against ``project_id``, the vector indexer reads the report back - and none
    of them can see a row the installer has not committed yet. Keeping this
    inside the single install transaction made the NCR insert fail on the
    project foreign key, and left the report unindexed, both silently.

    CONTINGENT: the transaction posture above is traced, not inferred - the
    publish happened inside the single install transaction and the subscribers
    open their own sessions. What is NOT verified is that the flagship BOQ
    actually yields an ERROR-severity result, which is what makes
    ``validation.results.errors_found`` fire at all. If it only ever produces
    warnings, the NCR half of the loss never occurred here and only the
