"""Partner-pack project scoping helper.

When a pack is active the workspace presents a focused view: projects tagged
with that pack's slug AND projects that carry no pack tag at all are shown.
Projects tagged with a *different* pack are hidden. This means activating a
pack never hides pre-existing projects (they have no tag), only projects that
belong to another pack's workspace.

Activation tags the pack's demo projects and any project created while the
pack is active; deactivation untags them so the normal listing returns.

This module is the single source of truth for "which pack scopes the workspace
right now", so every listing site applies the exact same rule. Every helper is
fail-soft: a partner-pack lookup error returns "no active pack", leaving the
caller's normal (un-scoped) query intact.
