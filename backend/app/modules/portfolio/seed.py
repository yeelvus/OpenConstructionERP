"""Portfolio demo seed - one programme structure over the demo projects.

Unlike every other module in the estate, this one is not a register inside a
project: it is a structure *over* the projects, so it is seeded once across the
whole install rather than once per project. There is one portfolio at the root,
a programme per sector beneath it, a region subprogramme wherever a sector runs
three or more jobs, and each demo project filed under exactly one leaf - which
is what ``oe_portfolio_membership`` allows, one node per project.

The classification is read from the projects themselves - the demo id says what
kind of job it is and the country code says where it runs - rather than from a
list of project ids, so an install carrying a partner pack's own country project
is filed correctly without this file knowing the pack exists.

On top of the tree it seeds a handful of cross-schedule links: the dependencies
that only exist because two projects share something, a crane coming off one job
onto the next, one commissioning team covering both in turn. They are directed
strictly from an earlier project to a later one, so the schedule-of-schedules
CPM can never find a cycle, and at least one link sits wholly inside a single
programme, so running the CPM on a programme node - not only on the root - has
real edges to apply.

What a reader sees on the portfolio screen afterwards:

* a navigable tree instead of an empty state - a portfolio, its programmes, the
  region subprogrammes under the busiest of them, and the projects filed under
  each, all three node types represented;
* a portfolio CPM that returns real numbers on any node with schedules under it:
  schedule and activity counts, the portfolio finish work-day, and a critical
  path that crosses project boundaries where a cross-link puts it there;
* a cross-links panel with links to look at, each one carrying the reason it
  exists rather than being an unexplained arrow between two projects.

Self-gating: the tree is a single global structure, so the seeder does nothing
at all once any portfolio node exists - which covers both the second boot and an
install where somebody has already built their own hierarchy. Only projects
carrying the demo marker are filed, so a customer's live project is never swept
into a portfolio it did not ask to be in.
