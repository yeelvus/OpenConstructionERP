"""A seeded yard always books waste, because a waste report that reads zero is a bug report.

The waste ratio is the number this module's report exists to state. It was
computed for every metered material and then booked or not booked on a coin
flip, so a project whose materials all came up the other way produced a report
stating a waste ratio of zero - not an error, just a screen that looks broken.
Measured over twenty thousand freshly drawn project ids at the smallest register
the seeder can produce, that happened at the rate the weights predict, which is
roughly one project in two hundred and seventy.

The repair is a reserved position rather than a heavier coin: the first metered
material that consumed anything books its waste whatever the draw says, and
every material after it is drawn exactly as before. The draw is still made for
the reserved material, so the generator advances identically and the rest of the
register is unchanged.

These tests drive the real seeder. What is supplied is what the database would
answer - which priced lines the project meters, its currency, and the in-project
reference guards - because none of that is a draw. The guarantee is asserted the
way the fix states it: with the draw turned off entirely, the register must
still book exactly one waste movement, and it must be the reserved material
carrying it. Asserting only that the tile is non-empty would go on passing by
luck the moment the reserve broke.
