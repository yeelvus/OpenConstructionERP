"""The notice register's screen holds a hand-written copy of the standard registry.

``ChangeIntelligencePage`` carries two literals that mirror
``change_intelligence.time_bar``: the contract-standard picker, whose values are
sent back to the register endpoint as the ``standard`` override, and a token to
label map for the resolved badge. Nothing generates them from the backend and
nothing compared them until this file, which is the same shape of defect
``test_contract_standard_registration`` guards on the server side: a family added
to one table and forgotten in another.

Both failure directions are quiet, which is why they need a test rather than a
reviewer.

A standard the backend recognises and the picker omits cannot be chosen, so a
project whose contract is that standard shows a badge naming a standard that is
not in the list underneath it. That happened: CCDC was recognised by the engine
and returned for two shipped packs while the picker offered five other families
and not that one.

A picker value the backend cannot resolve is worse, because it fails silently in
the other direction. The endpoint takes the override as free text, and an
unresolvable one falls through to the project's own standard, so the screen
reports periods for a standard the user did not pick and never says so. A typo
in the literal is enough.

The picker is deliberately allowed to hold a standard with no notice periods.
Recognised and timed are different questions, and a user choosing a held family
should get "no deadline asserted" rather than the family being missing from the
list as though the product had never heard of it.
