"""Fail if a shared test clock anchor appears that is not the declared one.

Ninety-nine fixed date constants live in the backend test suite, spread over
seventy-seven files, and between them they name forty distinct instants. The
same identifier means different days in different files: ``NOW`` is five
separate instants (2026-06-24, 06-25, 06-30, 07-08, 07-21), ``TODAY`` is six
(2026-06-06, 06-24, 07-10, 07-16, 07-26, 08-05), and ``AS_OF`` is 2025-01-01 in
one file and 2026-07-16 in another. Forty-three different names are in use for
the one concept.

That sounds like a defect and today it is not one, which is the whole reason
this gate exists in this shape rather than as a rewrite.

Why the ninety-nine are fine and stay untouched
-----------------------------------------------
Every one of them is file-local. No conftest defines a date, no fixture returns
one, and nothing in the suite lets two of these constants meet. Within any one
file the set is internally coherent: ``test_interface_management_register.py``
holds ``_PAST``, ``_AS_OF`` and ``_FUTURE`` as a consistent triple, and a
reader of that file is never misled. A test written against a local constant
and a helper written against a different local constant cannot disagree,
because they never appear in the same run with both constants live.

So the collision is latent, not live, and normalising ninety-nine constants
across seventy-seven files in a tree with many concurrent branches would be
certain churn today against a hypothetical benefit. The cheaper move is to make
the latent case unable to become live.

What makes it live is one thing: a *shared* anchor
--------------------------------------------------
The moment a date is defined somewhere every test can see - a conftest
constant, a fixture that returns "today" - the file-local constants stop being
independent. A test that pins 2026-07-16 locally and a helper that reads a
shared anchor pinned to 2026-06-24 will disagree about what day it is inside a
single run, and that disagreement surfaces as a logic bug in whatever the two
of them touch, a long way from either date.

This gate permits exactly one shared anchor, at one declared location under one
declared name. Anything else defined at shared scope fails. If the project ever
does want a suite-wide clock, it goes in the declared slot and the argument
about which instant it holds happens once, in one place, in the open.

What counts as shared scope
---------------------------
Two things, and only two:

* any ``conftest.py`` under the test root, because pytest hands its contents to
  every test in that directory tree without an import; and
* any test module imported by two or more other test modules, because that is a
  shared helper in practice whatever it is called. ``tests/_pg.py`` is one of
  these and is imported by more than a hundred files.

What counts as an anchor
------------------------
A module-level name bound to a value that *is* a date, or a pytest fixture that
returns or yields one. The check keys on the binding, not on the identifier, so
it needs no list of blessed names and cannot be defeated by inventing a
forty-fourth one.

Two shapes deliberately do not count, both of them present in the tree today
and both correct:

* a function parameter default, such as the ``rate_date: str = "2026-04-07"``
  on the row factory in ``tests/modules/i18n_foundation/conftest.py``. It is
  data handed to one factory, not a clock every test reads; and
* a module-level constant whose value merely *contains* a date, such as the
  ``ECB_XML`` feed sample in ``tests/modules/fx/conftest.py``. The value is a
  document, and the date inside it is part of the document.

The distinction is that the bound value has to be a date itself, not a thing
with a date in it.

What this gate does not do
--------------------------
It runs as a pre-commit hook and in the Repo hygiene lane, so it fires when
somebody commits or when CI runs. It is not a tripwire and nothing here watches
the tree: a shared anchor written this morning is caught when it is committed,
not when it is written. It also cannot see an anchor introduced by a route it
does not scan - a plugin, an installed package, an environment variable read at
collection time. It closes the path that is actually open, which is a constant
or a fixture in a file, and a reader should not assume more of it than that.
