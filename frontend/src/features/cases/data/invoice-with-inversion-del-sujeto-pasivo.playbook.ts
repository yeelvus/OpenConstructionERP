// Case: "Invoice construction work under inversion del sujeto pasivo" (ES).
//
// The platform ships the Spanish reverse-charge rule as data: art. 84.Uno.2 f)
// of Ley 37/1992, the sentence that has to appear on the invoice, and the scope
// note that it runs from the contract between promotor and contratista down the
// chain of subcontracts under it. A determination is recorded per invoice and
// carries the rule, the legal reference, the wording and the net amount, and
// the module's own rules refuse to let a record leave draft while the wording
// is missing or a VAT amount is still on it. The last step is the other half of
// the Spanish obligation: the invoice is valid on issue, but the record goes to
// the authority inside four calendar days.

  longDescDefault:
    "Inversion del sujeto pasivo moves the VAT on a construction invoice from the supplier to the customer, and it is not optional where it applies. It reaches works of construction or refurbishment of a building carried out under a contract between the promotor and the main contractor, and it follows down the subcontracts under that contract, which is why a subcontractor two levels down is inside it as surely as the contratista. Two mistakes cost money in opposite directions. Charging VAT where the reverse charge applies leaves the customer with a deduction the authority will not accept, and it is you they come back to. Applying it where it does not, on a repair or on work for a customer who is not acting as a business, leaves VAT you should have collected and did not. Both are decided per invoice, which is why the determination is recorded per invoice rather than set once on a customer.",
