"""A custom KPI can break down by a key inside ``classification``.

``classification`` is the only place a BOQ position records what KIND of work
it is, and an estimator's own vocabulary lives there: labour, material,
equipment, subcontract, indirect. Until now the KPI catalogue did not offer it,
so the nearest reachable field was ``source``, which answers a different
question entirely - how the row was entered. That column defaults to ``manual``
and every ordinary create path in the tree writes it literally; only the CAD and
AI import paths ever write anything else. So on an installation where the BOQs
were typed or imported from a workbook, a breakdown by it renders one bar and
looks like a working cost analysis. A KPI that reads a plausible number for the
wrong reason is harder to catch than one that reads zero.

The column is JSON, so there is no finite list of field names to whitelist: the
keys are ``din276`` or ``masterformat`` or ``nrm`` or whatever the estimator's
workbook calls its cost types, and a catalogue that had to know them in advance
would have to be edited before a deployment could read its own data. So the
catalogue declares the COLUMN and the spec supplies the key, which is the one
name in a spec that is not already a key in a table in the module.

That widening is what most of this file tests. The key is bounded by a pattern,
an undeclared column is refused, and the two refusals say different things
because they are different mistakes.
