"""A payment application is a claim for money, never a piece of software.

On the subcontractor payment portal and the cost value reconciliation screen,
the English word "application" means a formal claim for work done in a period,
the same sense as applying for planning permission.

That sentence used to end "this product has no software-application meaning:
every English string containing the word is the claim sense", and it was true
when it was written. It is not true now. The funding module asks for grants,
where an application is a request for money nobody has awarded yet rather than
a claim for money already earned, and the settings screen has an application
server. What settles which sense is meant is the screen, not the word, which is
the rule the scope below is built on.

Seventeen locales had translated it as a phone app anyway. Spanish said
"Aplicaciones de pago", Croatian "Primjene placanja", French "application de
paiement" while the rest of the same file said "demande de paiement". In three
languages the whole payment portal read that way, and Bengali managed the
correct native word in five keys and a transliterated loanword in seven others,
so one namespace disagreed with itself.

This exists because that class of fix does not stay fixed. A later batch pass
translating the English word out of context reintroduces it, and nothing
notices: the key is present, the value is not empty, it is not the English
string, and it is in the right script. Every check we run passes on a fluent
wrong noun.

The scope is derived, and that is the whole point of this file
------------------------------------------------------------
The first version of this check watched fourteen keys written out by hand, all
of them under `payportal.` and `cvr.`. It went green at 524fb03b8 and stayed
green, and at that same commit two hundred and thirty strings across seventeen
locales still said "app", because the defect had also settled in
`subcontractors.`, `howto.`, `portal.`, `info.`, `contracts.`,
`notifications.`, `homeportal.` and `payment_clock.`, and a key that is not on
the list is not examined at all. "Clean" was a fact about the list, not about
the locales.

The docstring of that version said fifty three English strings carry this
sense. The list underneath it guarded fourteen. A file that states its own
scope and then implements a smaller one will keep its own promise and still be
wrong, so the scope is no longer something anyone maintains: `english_scope()`
takes every key whose English is about a payment application. Add such a string
anywhere in the product and it is guarded the moment it exists.

Deriving it took four tries, and each earlier scope was too small in a way the
scope itself could not reveal:

  fourteen     a list written by hand
  fifty two    every key whose English text contains the phrase
  sixty three  plus keys named for it that never spell it out, because
               `cvr.col_application` is simply "Application" and
               `payment_clock.field_application_date` is "Application date"
  a hundred    plus the case catalogue, whose English is not in en.ts at all
  and four

The last widening is the one worth remembering. This product's English lives in
two places, not one: `en.ts`, and the two hundred odd `*.playbook.ts` files that
carry the case catalogue as `titleDefault`, `descDefault` and `longDescDefault`
beside their keys. A check that reads `en.ts` alone is structurally blind to
about twelve hundred English strings, and no amount of improving its pattern
would ever have found them. So this reads both, and any future check over
English strings should ask itself the same question first: where does the
English actually live.

Widening the scope was only half of it. A derived scope still asks each value
a question in a fixed list of spellings, and French spells the software noun
exactly as English does, so twelve French strings sat inside the scope and
answered "no" to every root the check knew. See LOCALE_ROOTS for why the
answer to "which spelling means software" has to be stored per language.

`payportal.back_to_app` is excluded by name. It means go back to this product,
which really is the software, and it is the one string on that screen where the
app reading is correct. A sweep that went by the word rather than the meaning
would have broken it.

The scope has been narrowed once, and only once, against the direction of
everything above. A key named merely for an application used to enter the scope
from anywhere, which was right while the claim was the only sense in the
product. With the funding module it stopped being right, and the check reported
four Filipino grant strings for saying aplikasyon, which is that language's
ordinary word for a formal application and is what the same file uses for a
building permit. Filipino keeps the two apart the way this check asks: its
payment portal says paghahabol, a claim. So the bare word in a key name is
evidence only on a payment screen now, the same condition the third signal
already carried. It took the scope from 114 keys to 110 and removed nothing but
those four. Narrowing a scope is how a check of this kind goes quietly useless,
so it is worth saying what was not done: the funding namespace is not excluded,
and English there that says payment application is still the claim and is still
checked.
