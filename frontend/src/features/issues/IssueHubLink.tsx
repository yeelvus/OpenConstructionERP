/**
 * Back-link from an issue-owning module to the Unified Issue Hub.
 *
 * The hub unions five registers (`IssueSource` in `issueSources.ts`) and deep
 * links into each one. Until this component existed the traffic only ran that
 * way: the hub could reach every source, and no source could reach the hub.
 * The only references to `/issues` anywhere in the tree were the router, the
 * nav catalogue, the route icon map and the preload map, all of them app
 * infrastructure rather than a screen a user is looking at. Someone standing
 * in the NCR register had no way to learn that the four sibling registers
 * exist, short of finding the row in the sidebar.
 *
 * The link deliberately carries no source filter. The hub holds `filterSource`
 * state but reads no query parameters, so a `?source=ncr` would be inert; and
 * even once it is wired, preselecting the register the user just left would
 * show them what they already had. The point of arriving here is the other
 * four.
