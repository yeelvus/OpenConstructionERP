"""What the drawing-sheet register promises on the way out: an order and a count.

Two properties, neither of which the read path actually had.

Order. ``SheetRepository.list_for_project`` ordered on ``page_number`` alone. A
page number is not unique: a set uploaded again starts at page 1 again, and one
import can register two revisions in a single instant. What settled those ties
was the query plan, and on this schema that means an index
``app.core.pg_optimizations`` attaches to ``create_all`` and an Alembic-built
database never receives, so the register's order was a property of how the
database had been built rather than of the rows in it. The route pages with
``offset`` and ``limit``, and two pages that settle one tie differently show a
row twice and skip the one it displaced. The test below pins a total order: the
sequence has to be a function of the rows, not of where they sit.

Count. The list route caps ``limit`` at 500 and the register asks for exactly
500, so a project holding more sheets than that was cut off with no way to
tell. The count is not expensive to produce - ``list_for_project`` already
computes it and the handler threw it away - it just never left the server. It
now travels as ``X-Total-Count``, the header the EAC and BCF list routes
already use, and CORS exposes it so a caller on another origin can read it.

Rows are seeded directly rather than split out of a PDF, so nothing here needs
reportlab and no test in this file skips.
