"""Validation rules for the Full EVM register (rule set ``full_evm``).

Earned value is arithmetic on top of a plan, and the arithmetic is only as
honest as the plan underneath it. A budget curve that dips, a final period that
does not add up to the budget, or an earned value larger than the whole scope
all produce a CPI that looks perfectly ordinary while describing a project that
does not exist. These rules exist to make that impossible to ship quietly.

They run on every baseline and measurement write and their findings are stored
on the row, so a list view shows whether a number can be trusted without
re-running the engine per item. They do not *block* the write: a baseline is
routinely half-entered, and refusing to save would cost the planner their work
to enforce a rule about work in progress. The blocking decision belongs to the
caller, which can read ``report.has_errors`` and refuse an *approval*.

Baseline rules
--------------
* ``full_evm.baseline_bac_positive``   - ERROR. A baseline with BAC <= 0 makes
  every ratio undefined and every forecast meaningless.
* ``full_evm.baseline_periods_ordered`` - ERROR. Period end dates must strictly
  increase with ordinal, with no duplicates: the curve is a function of time.
* ``full_evm.baseline_pv_monotonic``   - ERROR. Cumulative planned value must
  never decrease. A dip means someone entered a per-period amount into a
  cumulative column, which silently deflates every later SPI.
* ``full_evm.baseline_pv_matches_bac`` - ERROR. The last period's cumulative PV
  must equal BAC. If the curve stops short, SPI drifts towards a flattering
  number exactly as the project approaches completion.
* ``full_evm.baseline_quantity_monotonic`` - WARNING. Cumulative planned
  quantity, where supplied, must not decrease either. A warning rather than an
  error because quantity is optional supporting evidence, not the measurement
  base.

Measurement rules
-----------------
* ``full_evm.measure_non_negative``    - ERROR. PV, EV, AC and BAC are
  cumulative totals; a negative one is a data fault, not a credit.
* ``full_evm.measure_ev_within_bac``   - ERROR. You cannot earn more value than
  the entire scope is worth. EV > BAC is the classic symptom of progress
  claimed against a superseded, smaller budget.
* ``full_evm.measure_pv_follows_baseline`` - WARNING. The observed PV should
  match the baseline curve at the data date. A divergence is legitimate (a
  manual override) but must be visible.
* ``full_evm.measure_indices_defined`` - INFO. Reports which indices are
  undefined because their denominator is zero. This is INFO, never an error:
  a project with no spend and no earned value yet is the normal state at the
  start, not a defect.
* ``full_evm.measure_eac_method_declared`` - ERROR. The stored EAC method must
  be a supported name and the effective method must be recorded. A row that
  cannot say which of the disagreeing EAC formulas produced its number is not
  auditable.
* ``full_evm.measure_tcpi_achievable`` - WARNING. Flags a To Complete
  Performance Index that demands materially better cost efficiency than the
  project has ever achieved, including the undefined case where the budget is
  already spent with work outstanding.

Every rule reads the same plain dictionary the service builds, so none needs a
database session and all are unit-testable in isolation.
