"""International, framework-free payroll helpers.

This module holds small, side-effect-free helpers that make construction
labour payroll correct and clear for users anywhere in the world. It has no
database, no FastAPI, and no third-party dependency, so it imports and runs the
same in a unit test as it does in the request path. The service layer keeps its
own ``HTTPException``-raising logic and its DB-backed batch math; these helpers
are the pure arithmetic and plain-language layer a report, an export, a
background job, or a test can reuse without booting anything.

Design rules that keep the platform usable worldwide:

* No hardcoded currency, wage law, or locale. Every wage figure carries the
  currency the caller supplies; we never guess a default such as EUR or USD.
* No hardcoded overtime or deduction rule. The overtime threshold hours, the
  overtime multiplier, and any deduction rate are always explicit parameters.
  The defaults are neutral and documented (no overtime threshold unless one is
  given, an overtime multiplier of 1.5, no deduction unless a rate or amount is
  supplied), so any national convention plugs in without touching this code.
* Money is Decimal-exact. Amounts never touch ``float`` and never drift.
* Money is never summed across different currency codes. Mixing codes is a
  clean input error, not a silently-wrong total.
* Dates are ISO 8601 (``YYYY-MM-DD``).
* Bad input (garbage numbers, negative hours or rate, a zero-hours effective
  rate, an empty set) is turned into a clear ``ValueError`` or a well-defined
  zero. It never becomes a 500, a NaN, or an infinity.
* Pay-component and status words are localised (English, German, Russian) with
  an English fallback so a payroll clerk reads plain language, never a raw code.

Every money figure is derived by an explicit, documented formula and the
component parts (regular hours, overtime hours, the rates and multiplier used)
are exposed alongside the totals, so a worker or an auditor can see how each
number was reached.

        * ``overtime_multiplier``    - the multiplier used (default 1.5).
        * ``basic_rate``             - the stated basic rate, or ``""`` if none.

        * ``regular_pay``            - regular hours times rate.
        * ``overtime_pay``           - the multiplier applied to the overtime
                                       base, plus the fringe part at face value.
        * ``gross_pay``              - regular pay plus overtime pay.
        * ``total_deductions``       - sum of the supplied deductions.
