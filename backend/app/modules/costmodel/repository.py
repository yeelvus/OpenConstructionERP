"""5D Cost Model data access layer.

All database queries for cost snapshots, budget lines, and cash flow entries
live here.  No business logic - pure data access - *except* for the
currency-aware rollup helpers added by the R5 audit (May 2026): mixing
USD and EUR row totals via raw SQL ``SUM`` poisoned the dashboard /
EVM / budget summary for any multi-currency project, so the aggregators
now pull rows in Python and convert through the project's ``fx_rates``
before summing. The conversion logic itself is colocated here so each
caller cannot re-invent its own rules.
