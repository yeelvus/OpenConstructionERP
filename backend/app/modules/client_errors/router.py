"""Client-error sink API routes.

Endpoints:
    POST /                         - accept an anonymised client error report

The endpoint is intentionally write-only and unauthenticated so that
anonymous landing-page or marketing-site errors can still be captured.
A per-IP rate limit at 30 req/min (sliding window) keeps the surface
safe from abuse without introducing a Redis dependency.

Storage is a v4.3 follow-up - for now we forward the payload to the
standard ``logging`` pipeline at WARNING level so it shows up next to
backend errors in journald / log aggregators.

Performance note (2026-06-19)
------------------------------
FastAPI resolves all positional-body parameters *before* executing the
handler body.  The old signature ``submit_client_error(payload: ...,
request: Request)`` therefore parsed and validated the JSON body on every
request — including those that would be rejected by the rate limiter.  On
a CPU-starved 1-core VPS this meant a rate-limited client still paid the
full deserialization cost (~several ms of CPU, possible GIL contention,
and a ``logger.warning`` that drives a synchronous write to journald).

Fix: receive the raw ``Request`` only, perform the rate-limit check
first (pure in-memory, < 1 µs), and *then* decode the body.  A rejected
request now returns in < 1 ms with zero I/O.

Body-size guard: we also cap the raw body to ``_MAX_BODY_BYTES`` before
handing it to Pydantic so a large forged payload never buffers more than
8 KB in Python memory.  FastAPI's ``request.body()`` reads the already-
buffered Starlette body (no extra network I/O); the cap only affects
parsing.
