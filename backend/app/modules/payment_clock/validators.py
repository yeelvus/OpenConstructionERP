"""Payment clock validation rules.

The whole module exists for one sentence, and it is this one: **if no valid
payment notice is served in time, the notified sum is the sum the contractor
applied for**. Under the UK Act, the Irish Act, and the New South Wales,
Queensland and New Zealand security-of-payment Acts, that consequence follows
from silence alone. It is not an opinion about the work, it is not open to a
counter-argument about defects, and it decides adjudications. So it is a rule
here rather than a paragraph in a docstring, and it names the amount.

The consequence of silence is not the same everywhere, so it is read off the
regime rather than assumed:

* ``applied_sum_becomes_notified_sum`` - UK, Ireland, New South Wales,
  Queensland, New Zealand. The applied sum becomes the sum payable.
* ``evidential_bar`` - Singapore. The respondent who filed no payment response
  in time cannot put that material before the adjudicator.
* ``deemed_dispute`` - Malaysia. Silence is a denial of the whole claim, and
  the claim goes to adjudication.
* ``none`` - the EU Late Payment Directive and the German VOB/B and BGB
  regimes, which set a payment period and interest but no notice sequence.

Rules, all registered under the ``payment_clock`` rule set:

* ``payment_clock.notified_sum``             - ERROR.   The window closed with
  no payment notice. This is the one above.
* ``payment_clock.notice_in_time``           - ERROR.   A notice served after
  its statutory deadline, naming the deadline and how late it was.
* ``payment_clock.pay_less_basis``           - ERROR.   A pay-less notice has
  to state the sum considered due and how it was calculated.
* ``payment_clock.final_date_after_due_date``- ERROR.   The final date for
  payment must fall after the due date.
* ``payment_clock.statutory_interest``       - WARNING. Past the final date and
  unpaid, interest runs, at a rate the finding names, on the sum that actually
  had to be paid rather than on the sum applied for. Which sum that is depends
  on the notices: see :func:`_sum_due`.
* ``payment_clock.notice_currency``          - WARNING. A notice in a currency
  other than the application's.

Every rule reads a plain dict built by
:func:`app.modules.payment_clock.service.clock_snapshot`, so the rules can be
run against a fixture with no database at all.
