"""PG: the boot heal numbers ``seq`` by heap order, and the fixup puts it back.

``app.core.postgres_migrator`` adds ``oe_progress_entry.seq`` to a pre-v3258
table with ``ADD COLUMN ... DEFAULT nextval(...)``, which PostgreSQL evaluates
while rewriting the table - so the rows come out numbered in the order they
happen to lie on disk. The Alembic migration numbers the same rows by
``recorded_at, created_at, id``. Every "latest wins" query in the progress
repository leads with ``seq``, so until this fixup existed the same three rows
reported a different current reading depending on which path built the schema.

The first test drives the REAL heal rather than re-typing its ALTER statement:
the claim under test is what ``postgres_auto_migrate`` does to real rows, and a
test that issued its own ADD COLUMN would measure the test's SQL instead. It
uses ``pg_engine`` because the heal bounds every DDL with ``SET LOCAL
lock_timeout = '3s'`` and would fail against a test holding the table open.

The rest reach the same broken STATE the cheap way - rows whose ``recorded_at``
runs against their insertion order, which is what heap-order numbering leaves
behind - so they run inside the rolled-back ``pg_session``.

Gated by ``OE_TEST_DB=pg`` (see conftest).
