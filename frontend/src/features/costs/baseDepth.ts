// How thoroughly a cost base is worked out, as a band from 1 to 5, so the
// picker can say more than "here are nine countries, good luck".
//
// It is derived from the catalogue's work-item count and from nothing else, and
// that is a decision worth writing down. The registry carries four other things
// that sound like they measure depth - bundled, coefficient, repriceable_markets
// and market_count - and three of them are constant across the bases that have
// them: every national base ships bundled, every one of them declares 49
// repriceable markets, and all but Vietnam can be repriced by resource code. A
// criterion that scores the same for eight of nine families moves every bar by
// the same amount and separates nothing, so folding it into a score would only
// dress the number up. The one attribute that does discriminate, `coefficient`
// (Vietnam and Indonesia are codeless and need a resource price sheet), is shown
// beside the meter as its own mark rather than deducted from it: it is a
// different fact about the base, not less of the same fact.
//
// Bands are absolute rather than relative to the largest base. A ratio would
// re-scale every base the day a bigger one is added, and a base does not become
// shallower because a neighbour grew.
