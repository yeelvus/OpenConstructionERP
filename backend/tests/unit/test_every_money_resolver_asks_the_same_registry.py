"""The money resolvers are checked against each other, not against a roster.

Five paths are compared here, and until this file existed they agreed because
somebody had typed the same numbers into each of them. That is the failure mode
this codebase has already been bitten by twice: two registries that match today,
one of them gains a row, and nothing notices until a user does.

Five is this file's coverage, not a count of the backend, which is the reading
the first version of this docstring invited. An AST sweep of ``app`` found
fifteen functions that are handed a currency and ask ``minor_units`` or
``money_quantum`` how many digits it keeps, and nine more that are handed a
currency and quantize to a literal of their own anyway. A check asserting that
the backend still holds exactly five would be asserting something that was never
true, so this file neither claims it nor tests it.

Four of the five are swept below. The fifth is the one this file read as four
for a while: ``app.modules.property_dev.document_templates._format_money``, the
renderer behind every contract, receipt and certificate the property module
issues. It took a locale and no currency at all and quantised to a
``Decimal("0.01")`` literal, so it was never a resolver that agreed, it was a
resolver nobody had counted. It reads ``minor_units`` now, and is pinned in
``test_a_property_document_prints_an_amount_in_its_own_currencys_units``. It is
named here rather than swept below because importing it pulls the whole PDF
stack into a file that otherwise touches nothing but arithmetic.

So nothing here asserts a currency against a literal. Every assertion asks one
resolver what it says and compares it to what another resolver says, iterating
over ``CURRENCIES`` so that a currency added tomorrow is covered the moment it is
added and no test needs a manual edit to keep up.

The per-code decisions themselves live where they are made and are pinned where
they are made: the document overrides in ``test_einvoice_rules`` and the registry
counts in ``test_money_iso4217_minor_units``. Recording a decision and detecting
drift are different jobs and are kept in different files on purpose.

Which layer governs what is written out in full in ``app.core.money``, above
:func:`app.core.money.minor_units`. The short version, because it is the thing a
reader has to have in mind to know whether a failure here is a bug or a decision:
the value layer rounds the amount and follows the currency's real subdivision,
the document layer caps that at what EN 16931 permits, and the screen layer is in
the frontend and follows the reader's own conventions instead. Only the first two
are backend code and only the first two are compared here.
