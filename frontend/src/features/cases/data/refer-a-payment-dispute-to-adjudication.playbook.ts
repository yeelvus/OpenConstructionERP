// Case: "Refer a payment dispute to adjudication" (GB).
//
// The statutory right to adjudicate runs on a timetable with no room in it
// for going and looking for records, so the case is about assembly rather
// than advocacy: what the clock says was notified, one reproducible evidence
// pack, service that cannot be challenged on jurisdiction, and the decision
// put back into the job. Content strings are key plus inline English default
// and live only here.

  longDescDefault:
    "The Housing Grants, Construction and Regeneration Act 1996 gives a party to a construction contract the right to refer a dispute to adjudication at any time, and the process is deliberately fast: the referral follows the notice within seven days and the adjudicator reaches a decision within twenty eight days of the referral unless the parties agree to extend it. Nothing in that timetable leaves room to go looking for records. The work that decides an adjudication was done months earlier, by whoever kept the notices, the diaries and the correspondence somewhere they could be found. This case is about that assembly rather than about the advocacy, and it assumes the argument itself is being run by people who do this for a living.",
