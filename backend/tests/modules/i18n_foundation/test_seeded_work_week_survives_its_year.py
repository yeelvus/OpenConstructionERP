"""The seeded work week must outlive the single year the seed file covers.

Every other test in this package builds its calendars with ``make_calendar``.
That proves the mechanism and certifies nothing about the data we ship, which is
how a seed file covering exactly one year sat behind a green cross-year test. So
this module loads the real ``work_calendars.json`` through the real seeder and
asks the service the same questions a caller would.

Everything here is asserted per day, never per year. Sunday-Thursday and
Monday-Friday are both five days a week, so an annual total is identical under
either and a count-based assertion passes while every individual day is wrong.
:func:`test_a_yearly_total_cannot_see_this` pins that blind spot rather than
leaving the next author to rediscover it.

Holidays are deliberately not asserted here. They are not carried across years
and that gap is open work, so a holiday assertion would either fail or quietly
record the gap as intended behaviour.
