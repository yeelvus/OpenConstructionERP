"""Accessibility ratchet: attributes that never translate, and controls with no name.

Three defect classes live here. They are separate defects with one thing in
common: every gate this repository owns is blind to all three, and for the same
reason each time. Nothing here is a missing key, so the key gates never ask.

  1. AN ATTRIBUTE THAT NEVER WENT THROUGH TRANSLATION.
     aria-label="Close" on a host element is a bare English literal. It renders
     "Close" in all 42 languages, forever. check_i18n_orphan_keys.py cannot see
     it: that gate asks whether a KEY is answered by the locale files, and a
     string that never became a key is never asked about. tsc, eslint and the
     build all pass - the string is valid TypeScript. It was found by walking
     JsxAttribute nodes and asking what each value IS, not by grepping for a
     call form: a grep for `aria-label={t(` is blind to the ones that never
     called t() at all, which is precisely the population.

  2. A VALUE THAT BAKES THE LANGUAGE IN AT MOUNT.
     `useState(t('x'))` runs its initialiser on the first render and never
     again, so the value keeps whatever language the component mounted in. A
     reader who switches language gets a screen whose visible text translated
     and whose attribute did not - confident, fluent, and wrong, which is worse
     for a screen reader user than a missing name. `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps`
     does not catch it because that plugin is not installed in this repository;
     eslint.config.js stubs it with a no-op create() and sets the rule to off,
     so nothing here has ever applied pressure to a dependency array.

  3. AN ICON-ONLY CONTROL WITH NO ACCESSIBLE NAME AT ALL.
     A <button> whose only child is an icon, carrying no aria-label, no
     aria-labelledby, no title and no text, is announced as "button". This is
     not a translation gap - there is nothing to translate. It is a control
     that does not exist for anyone using a screen reader, in every language
     including English.

WHY A RATCHET AND NOT A BAN. All three classes have existing debt that is
deliberately not being fixed in one go - placeholders whose split between real
prose and sample values is a per-string judgement, and hook shapes that feed
toasts rather than attributes. A gate that failed on all of it would be turned
off within a day. So this records today's debt and refuses to let it grow.

HOW THE DETECTORS ARE BUILT, and this is the part that matters if you change
them. Each detector asks a question about ONE item in isolation - is THIS
attribute value human prose on a host element, is THIS hook call seeded from
t(), does THIS control have any accessible name - and the count falls out of
the answers. None of them carries a list of known-bad sites. A detector built
on "these are the 45 known attributes" reports green the moment a component
introduces a 46th, because the new one is not in the set it was told to watch.
The set belongs in the baseline, never in the detector.

WHY THE BASELINE IS KEYED BY TEXT AND NOT BY LINE NUMBER. Line numbers move
under you. While this gate was being written, an unrelated change to
file-manager shifted three tracked sites from lines 273, 291 and 302 to 313,
330 and 341 without altering a character of them. A line-keyed baseline would
have reported three repairs and three new defects in the same run.

USAGE
    python scripts/check_a11y_attribute_ratchet.py
    python scripts/check_a11y_attribute_ratchet.py --update-baseline
    python scripts/check_a11y_attribute_ratchet.py --list          # show current findings

Exit 0 means every finding is either recorded debt or intentionally allowed.
Exit 1 means something new appeared, or a baseline entry names something that
no longer exists (a stale entry - fix it by regenerating, so the baseline keeps
telling the truth about what is left).
