/**
 * #171 - on /files the NAME cell rendered as one letter and an ellipsis
 * ("F...", "C...") while TYPE, STATUS, VER., SIZE, MODIFIED and DISCIPLINE
 * all printed in full, and it held the same tenth of the table at 1120,
 * 1400 and 1720px. The name never won the slack at any window width.
 *
 * The cause is half an idiom. The cell carried `max-w-0` and the inner span
 * carried `truncate`, which is the pair that makes a long filename clip
 * instead of stretching the column. What was missing is `w-full` - in an
 * auto-layout table that is what says "this column takes what the others do
 * not need". Without it, `max-w-0` reads as "make this column as narrow as
 * you can", which is exactly what the browser did.
 *
 * WHAT THIS TEST CANNOT DO. jsdom does no table layout: every element here
 * measures 0x0, so no assertion in this file can show that the name column
 * got wider. It pins the structural rule instead - exactly one column claims
 * the slack, it is the free-text one, and it caps its own content - and that
 * rule is what was broken. Whether the result reads well needs a browser at
 * the three widths in the report. Same for the ChangeOrders guard below.
 *
 * Run:  npx vitest run src/features/file-manager/components/__tests__/nameColumnWidth.test.tsx
