"""PG: v3304 classifies stock rows that already existed before it ran.

A fresh install never runs this migration. ``env.py`` detects a blank database
on entry and short-circuits to ``create_all`` plus ``stamp heads``, so "empty
database, upgrade head" executes no revision at all and still reports success.
Every signal such a run produces is therefore silent about whether the
migration works, and the only way to find out is to put rows in front of it
that were written under the old schema.

That is what this does. It builds the four tables v3304 touches in their
pre-migration shape inside a schema of its own - ``unit_cost_avg`` and
``unit_cost`` NOT NULL, no currency column anywhere - seeds one balance of each
kind, runs the revision's real ``upgrade()`` against them, and reads back what
it decided.

The four fixtures are the four outcomes, and each one is wrong in a different
way if the classifier slips:

* single      two receipts, both against EUR orders. The stored average was
              right all along and must survive untouched.
* mixed       one EUR receipt and one USD receipt. The stored number is the
              blend of the two, so it must be withdrawn.
* unresolved  a receipt whose ``reference_id`` is NULL. Nothing can say what
              currency it was bought in, so the average cannot be vouched for.
* untouched   a balance with no inbound movements at all. An empty set is not
              agreement, and this must not come out "single".

The single case also carries the join detail that would otherwise fail
silently: its movements store ``batch_lot`` as NULL while the balance stores
``''``, which is exactly what the receipt path writes. If the two stopped
matching, every balance would fall into the unresolved bucket and the migration
would still finish and still print a tidy summary.

    If the movement-to-balance join stops matching, nothing raises. Every
    balance comes back with no inbound movements, every average is withdrawn
    as unresolvable, and the migration prints a tidy summary and succeeds. The
    guard turns that into an abort inside the migration's own transaction.

    Provoked by giving the only balance a different ``catalog_item_id`` from
    the only inbound movement, which is what a mismatched key part looks like
    from the classifier's side.
