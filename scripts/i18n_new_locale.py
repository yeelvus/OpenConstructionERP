"""Bootstrap a new UI locale: work out what has to be translated, then assemble it.

Adding a language to this app is not "copy en.ts and translate it". Two facts
make that wrong, and both are measured rather than assumed by this script.

First, en.ts is not the full key set. English is supplied inline at the call
site as `t('key', { defaultValue: 'English' })`, so a key only reaches en.ts
when someone put it there. Every translated locale carries thousands of keys
English does not. Building a new locale from en.ts silently drops them and the
new language shows English on those screens forever.

Second, no single existing locale is the full key set either. Arabic carries
plural forms (_zero, _two, _few, _many) that a two-form language never asks
for, and the two-form locales are each missing a handful of ordinary keys that
some other locale has. Grounding a new language in one sibling inherits that
sibling's gaps.

So the target key set is computed: the union of every locale on disk, minus the
plural categories the new language does not have according to CLDR. Plural
category membership comes from the language itself, never from English.

The English source text for each key is harvested from three places in priority
order: en.ts, the `defaultValue` at the call site, and the English field beside
a `<name>Key` field in the case playbooks and module guides. `plan` reports what
each source covered and names the keys it found nothing for, because a key with
no English anywhere is a bug in its own right: an English reader sees the raw
key, and a translator has nothing to work from.

Usage:
    python scripts/i18n_new_locale.py plan     et
    python scripts/i18n_new_locale.py extract  et [--batch-size 400]
    python scripts/i18n_new_locale.py delta    et
    python scripts/i18n_new_locale.py assemble et
    python scripts/i18n_new_locale.py verify   et

`delta` catches a locale's corpus up when target_keys() has moved since
extract() ran (new modules landed, or keys reached the shipped locales after
this locale's own extraction) - writes exactly the new keys to
batch_delta.json and updates _order.json, without touching any existing
batch_NNN.json.
