"""Parse DDC DwgExporter Excel output into drawable entities.

DDC DwgExporter produces an Excel file with AutoCAD database records.
Geometry entities (AcDbLine, AcDbPolyline+AcDbVertex, AcDbArc, AcDbCircle,
AcDbEllipse, AcDbSpline, AcDbHatch, AcDbText, AcDbMText,
AcDbBlockReference) have coordinate fields that we extract and convert
into the same JSON format used by the ezdxf-based DXF parser, so the
frontend DxfViewer can render them identically.

Coordinate formats in DDC output:
  - Lines: "295.144, 812.512, 0" (comma-separated)
  - Vertices: "[0.5 0.5]" or "[0.5 0.5 0.0]" (space-separated in brackets)
  - Arcs/Circles: same as lines for Center
  - Scientific: "1.22868e+06, 801718, 0"

    ``BlockId`` carries the owning block-table record, and in the DWG object
    model that is ``*Model_Space``, ``*Paper_Space*`` **and one entry per block
    definition**. Filing all three as layouts is what put every door and window
    block in the sheet picker as if it were a drawable sheet.

    The export answers this itself when it can. Its ``<AcDbBlockTableRecord>``
    rows are the drawing's block table, and each carries a ``Layout`` flag that
    is true for exactly the records AutoCAD built a sheet around. On a real
    17 MB export 809 records came through with ``Layout`` true for two of them,
    ``*Model_Space`` and ``*Paper_Space``, and false for the other 807. Nothing
    needs guessing when that table is present.

    The three heuristics below are for exports that carry no block table, and
    they run in order. A ``*`` name that is not a layout is one of AutoCAD's own
    anonymous records and is never a sheet. Otherwise the evidence has to be
    positive: a name some block reference actually places is a block
    definition, whatever it happens to be called. That last test holds whether
    the export writes block names or numeric object ids in ``BlockId``; a real
    DwgExporter build was since confirmed to write names, with 577 of the 579
    referenced names appearing there as owners.

    The reference test alone was not enough, which is why the other two exist.
    A dimension owns its ``*D`` record implicitly rather than placing it
    through an ``<AcDbBlockReference>`` row, and an unplaced definition is
    referenced by nothing at all, so both were offered as sheets: one real
    export listed 1108 of them against a single drawing.

    Anything every test leaves undecided is treated as a sheet. That is the
    conservative direction: misfiling a sheet as a block hides its geometry
    entirely, while misfiling a block as a sheet only puts back the spurious
    entry this function exists to remove.

    Args:
        block_id: The row's ``BlockId`` cell.
        referenced_blocks: Names placed by an ``<AcDbBlockReference>`` row.
        block_table: Record name → whether that record is a layout, read from
            the export's own block table. Empty or ``None`` when the export

    # ── Pass 3: collect vertices grouped by ParentID ──────────────────

    # Bugfix (audit C11): the DDC DWG export writes one vertex row per
    # AcDbVertex, and each row has BOTH a ``Start Point`` and an
    # ``End Point`` column for line-segment vertices. The previous
    # implementation appended both into the polyline's vertex list
    # unconditionally, which meant every interior vertex got duplicated
    # (segment N's end == segment N+1's start) and the polyline was
    # effectively walked twice. Total polyline lengths and areas came
    # out ~2× the real value. The subsequent ``deduped`` pass only
    # removed IMMEDIATELY consecutive duplicates, so vertices duplicated
    # across alternating rows survived.
    #
    # Fix: collect vertex rows in DXF order (preserving the AcDbVertex
    # row sequence), then take ONLY the Start Point - or the Point /
    # End Point as fallback when Start is missing. The polyline's true
    # geometry is the sequence of vertex Start points; segment endpoints
    # are reconstructed as the next vertex's Start. Closed polylines
    # are handled by ``polyline_meta[eid].closed`` downstream.
