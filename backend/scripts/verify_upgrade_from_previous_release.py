"""Run the CURRENT code against a database the PREVIOUS release built.

Half two of the upgrade lane. ``age_database_to_previous_release.py`` runs
first, in an interpreter holding the previous release, and leaves behind a
database with that release's schema and a few rows in it. This script runs in
an interpreter holding the current code, against that same database.

What it is for
--------------
Every other lane starts from an empty database, so the only thing they have
ever tested is a fresh install. Nothing in this codebase calls
``alembic upgrade``: the schema moves at boot by a helper that only issues
``ADD COLUMN`` and ``CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS``, plus ``create_all`` for
tables that are wholly absent. That is enough for a revision made of nullable
columns and is not enough for a NOT NULL, a rename, a type change or a
backfill - and until this lane existed, nothing said so.

The five things it proves, in order
-----------------------------------
1. The database really is old. The set of tables and columns the current
   metadata declares and the database does not have is computed BEFORE the
   current code runs, and it has to be non-empty. Without that, the whole
   lane could pass on a database that was never aged - and a lane that passes
   vacuously is worse than no lane, because it reports coverage that is not
   there. An empty set here means the pin in the workflow has been moved
   forward to a release that carries no schema change, and the lane says so
   rather than going green.
2. The database is at an older migration revision than the code. Pre-15.4.0
   wheels ship no ``alembic.ini``, so a real install of one records no
   revision at all; that reads as ``None`` here and is equally acceptable.
   What is not acceptable is a database already sitting at the current head.
3. The schema actually moved. After the current code has booted once, that
   same missing set has to be empty. This is the check a NOT NULL column with
   no default fails, because the auto-migrate helper cannot add one to a table
   that has rows in it.
4. The health signal agrees. ``schema_heal_failed`` must read false, not null.
   What ``alembic_head_matches`` has to read depends on which cohort the aged
   database belongs to, because the two have genuinely different honest answers
   and a single expectation would make one of them unsatisfiable.

   A database that arrives already carrying a revision - 15.4.0 and later - must
   read true. A database that arrives with none at all - pre-15.4.0, whose wheels
   ship no revision tree - must read unknown, and must still be carrying no
   revision afterwards. That is not a lowered bar. Stamping such a database head
   would claim a position nothing verified and would erase the only durable
   record that it is behind, permanently, so the boot refuses and the refusal is
   what is being checked here. This check used to demand true from both, which
   the second cohort could only ever satisfy by being lied about.
5. A real read path answers. The NCR register is reached over HTTP with a
   token, because an authenticated endpoint answers 401 to an anonymous
   caller and a 401 would satisfy any assertion written as "not a 500".

Every mapped column of every table that was missing something is also selected
directly, because that is the exact query shape an ORM read issues and the
exact one that raises UndefinedColumn on a half-migrated database.

What this does not see
----------------------
Presence and nullability, not types: a column whose type a revision widens or
narrows reads as unchanged here. A rename is indistinguishable from an
addition, because the new name gets added and the old one keeps the data, so
the comparison goes green on a database that lost the mapping. And a revision
whose work is a data backfill leaves no schema signal at all. Those three
shapes are outside this script and still need a test of their own.

Environment:
    DATABASE_URL           Required. Async URL of the aged database.
    DATABASE_SYNC_URL      Required. Sync URL of the same database.
    OE_UPGRADE_AGED_STATE  Required. The handover JSON the aging half wrote.

Exit code 0 when every check passed, 1 otherwise.

    """Where the database disagrees with what the current metadata declares.

    Returns missing tables, missing columns, and then nullability disagreements
    split by DIRECTION, because the two directions are different defects with
    different repairs and one shared list would blur them:

    ``model_notnull_db_nullable``
        The model promises NOT NULL and the database accepts NULL.
        ``postgres_migrator`` writes NOT NULL into its ``ADD COLUMN`` only when
        the column also carries a server default to backfill the rows already
        there::

            not_null = " NOT NULL" if (not col.nullable and default) else ""

        A NOT NULL column with no default - the textbook change an additive
        heal cannot make - is therefore added NULLABLE instead of failing. The
        column name appears, so a check that only compares names reports the
        upgrade as complete while the constraint the model promises is simply
        absent.

    ``db_notnull_model_nullable``
        The database insists on NOT NULL and the model does not. This is what a
        revision that WIDENS a column leaves behind when it never runs: the
        heal only ever adds columns and indexes, it has no ``DROP NOT NULL``,
        so the old constraint survives. Application code that assigns ``None``
        into such a column then raises NotNullViolation on an ordinary write,
        which is a live 500 rather than a latent gap.

    Checking only the first direction is what let an upgrade ship with two
    columns NOT NULL that the models declare nullable: the lane compared one
    way, found nothing, and called the schema healed.
