// Case: "Chase every overdue date in one place".
//
// The cross-module deadline register gathers the due dates each module tracks
// on its own, the sweep tells the owners and escalates what has gone stale,
// and the worst item becomes a tracked action. Content strings are key plus
// inline English default and live only here.

The register is the one view that adds them up, and the sweep is what stops the reading being purely academic.",
