"""Console email backend - logs structured records instead of sending.

Purpose: zero-config default for local development.  A fresh checkout
runs without MSA credentials, but developers still need to see *what*
the app would have sent (subject, recipient, body preview) so they can
test password-reset and notification flows without a real SMTP server.

The backend is also a useful fallback in production for environments
where outbound SMTP is intentionally disabled (air-gapped installs,
compliance freezes) - operators see every attempted send in the app log
instead of a silent no-op.

Those two audiences want opposite answers from ``send``, which is what
``delivery_expected`` decides.  An operator who wrote ``EMAIL_BACKEND=console``
asked for a log-only transport and got one, so the log line *is* the delivery
and reporting success is honest.  A deployment that merely never set the
variable is running on a field default nobody picked, and telling it the send
worked removes the last signal anyone had: no failure log, no error to the
caller, and afterwards no way to name who never got their mail.
