 * compose-case-layers.mjs
 *
 * Composes a family spine plus one country layer into the playbook
 * files the rest of the pipeline already reads, at
 * frontend/src/features/cases/data/<slug>.playbook.ts.
 *
 * The problem this exists for: a country case today is a whole page
 * written again. Nine countries means nine copies of the same workflow,
 * and the pack list is longer than that (fourteen countries as of
 * 2026-09-05, counted with the commands below rather than remembered). Here the workflow is written once as a
 * spine with slots, and a country is a small file that says which steps
 * it surfaces, in what order, and what its own words are for the things
 * the slots name.
 *
 * Nothing downstream changes. This writes a normal playbook, and then
 * generate-case-page.mjs, add_case_rail.py, put_case_face.py,
 * generate-cases.mjs, generate-gallery.mjs and generate-sitemap.mjs run
 * exactly as they do now.
 *
 * WHAT BELONGS WHERE
 *   spine  - the sentences. Written once, translated once, shared by
 *            every country in the family.
 *   layer  - slot values (proper nouns and numbers, the same in every
 *            language), which steps it surfaces and in what order, and
 *            the module each step routes to. Routing is a fact about
 *            our product, not prose, so it is layer-owned and costs no
 *            translation.
 *
 * THE RULE THAT KEEPS IT HONEST
 *   A layer may carry an `override` on a step, replacing a spine
 *   sentence outright. One is a country genuinely being different. Two
 *   layers overriding the SAME step is not: it means the spine sentence
 *   was written too narrowly, and the fix is to widen it with a slot
 *   rather than to let every country carry its own copy. So that case
 *   fails the build and names both countries and the step. This is a
 *   gate rather than a comment because a rule that lives only in prose
 *   gets broken by the fifth country, and by then it is thirty pages of
 *   overrides and the family has quietly become nine pages again.
 *
 *   A second gate came out of composing rather than out of designing. Two
 *   slots that a sentence contrasts must not resolve to the same value.
 *   The neutral page called both the valuation and the payment document
 *   an "interim application", so "raise the {payDoc} against the approved
 *   {valuationDoc}" composed to "raise the interim application against
 *   the approved interim application" and shipped. A hand-written page
 *   never says this, because a person reads it. A composed page says it
 *   because the whole point is that nobody reads every composition, so
 *   the things a reader would have caught have to be caught here.
 *
 *   The same reasoning, with a different remedy, covers the indefinite
 *   article: "A {valuationDoc}" is right for one country and wrong for
 *   the next, and which one is not knowable when the sentence is
 *   written. That one the composer simply fixes, because it is
 *   mechanical, and only for plain lowercase words, because "an RFI" is
 *   correct and a rule that rewrote it would be doing the damage.
 *
 * WHAT THE GATES CANNOT CATCH
 *   Two slots holding distinct but swapped values. The collapse gate sees
 *   two slots resolving to ONE value; it cannot see two slots resolving to
 *   the WRONG two. A layer that named the payment claim as the valuation
 *   document and the tax invoice as the payment document passed every gate
 *   and composed "Open a clock over the tax invoice starting from the day
 *   the payment claim is served", which is fluent and is not what the
 *   Construction Contracts Act says. It was found by reading the prose.
 *
 *   The obvious gate for it is wrong, and this is measured rather than
 *   assumed. "clockStart must reference payDoc" holds for AU ES HU NZ SA
 *   XX and fails for BR DE MX RU ZA, and those five are all correct:
 *   Brazil counts from the attestation of the boletim de medicao, Germany
 *   from the client receiving the verifiable statement, Mexico from the
 *   authorisation of the estimacion, Russia from the signing of the KS-2
 *   act, South Africa from the interim payment certificate. The rule would
 *   fail five correct layers on its first run. Worse, the broken NZ layer
 *   was structurally identical to the correct ZA one: a tax invoice in
 *   payDoc and a different document in clockStart. Only knowing which
 *   document the statute counts from separates them, and the composer does
 *   not have that and cannot derive it.
 *
 *   So a new layer needs its composed prose read once by somebody who knows
 *   the jurisdiction. The gates remove the failures a reader would not
 *   catch; they do not remove the reader.
 *
 * WHY IT IS WORTH DOING
 *   Not for the pages we already have. Rewriting the existing 72 country
 *   pages this way is about a 2.4x saving on prose that is already
 *   written, which is a real number and a weak argument.
 *
 *   The argument is the pages that do not exist. Page-per-country grows
 *   as workflows times countries, because every pair is a whole page
 *   written and then translated into every locale. The spine shape grows
 *   as workflows plus workflows times countries, where the second term
 *   is a small slot file and not prose. That is roughly an order of
 *   magnitude across the pack list, and more importantly it is the
 *   difference between a cost that scales with the product of two
 *   growing numbers and one that scales with their sum.
 *
 *   Count the inputs rather than trusting this comment. An earlier
 *   version of it said fifteen pack countries and the real number was
 *   fourteen:
 *     ls packs | wc -l                                    directories
 *     find packs -name manifest.py | grep -c /src/         loadable packs
 *     grep -rhoE '"country": "[A-Z]{2}"' packs --include=manifest.py
 *   Measured 2026-09-05: 21 directories, 20 loadable (aus-nzs has no
 *   manifest), 14 distinct countries, AU BR CA CN DE GB HU IN MX NZ RU
 *   SA US ZA. XX appears too and is the neutral pack, not a country.
 *
 *   None of the conclusion rested on the fifteenth country. We are not
 *   buying a discount on the pages we already have, we are buying the
 *   ability to add the remaining countries at all.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES NOT YET DO
 *   Translate once. Keys are still minted per page, so a spine sentence
 *   three countries share is still three keys and three translations,
 *   and `keyRoot` on the spine is declared and read by nothing. That was
 *   deliberate: keeping the existing per-page keys is what made the
 *   migration cost zero retranslations. Realising the saving needs the
 *   spine sentences translated under their own keys and expanded per
 *   page with slots filled at merge time, which is not built. Until it
 *   is, `--sharing` reports what is actually shared rather than what the
 *   design would allow, and the two numbers are not the same.
 *
 * WHAT IS NOT A FAMILY
 *   The taxonomy has thirty families and not all of them are workflows.
 *   F11-indirect-tax-in-the-bill was picked deliberately as the one least
 *   likely to decompose, and it does not. Its four pages ask four
 *   different questions: which provincial tax is recoverable, whether the
 *   licence subclass covers the scope, who accounts for the tax under a
 *   reverse charge, and what stays outside the rate. They share a subject,
 *   not a sequence, and a spine needs a sequence.
 *
 *   Measured rather than judged. Exactly one step is genuinely common,
 *   "declare the base each charge is computed on", and it appears in three
 *   of the four pages: the Canadian pricing page puts two parallel taxes
 *   on one pre-tax subtotal, the Quebec page says 14.975 percent is two
 *   rates on one base rather than one rate applied to the other's result,
 *   and the Indian page points every markup and cess at its own base. One
 *   shared step out of five is not a spine. F01 shares seven of eleven.
 *
 *   The reason it is not a family is more useful than the refusal. Its
 *   content is a concern that rides on other families' steps, and the
 *   layers already do this without being told to: the German, Spanish and
 *   Hungarian F01 layers each attach the reverse charge as a note on the
 *   same spine step, invoice. Three layers converged on one placement
 *   independently. Building F11 as a family would have written that
 *   content a fourth time, beside three copies that already work, and
 *   increased the duplication it was meant to remove.
 *
 *   So the unit that wants reuse here is smaller than a spine: one step,
 *   shared across families. One instance is a hypothesis, and it is not
 *   built.
 *
 *   Do not try to predict this from the taxonomy. The obvious signal,
 *   whether a family's name chains actions, sorts F11 with F01 and is
 *   wrong. One differs-note of the thirty mentions a sequence, which is
 *   how that note happens to be phrased rather than a fact about the
 *   family. Decomposability was found by reading the pages, and --sharing
 *   over a draft spine is the cheap way to check before committing to one.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node frontend/scripts/compose-case-layers.mjs --family f01-progress-payment
 *   node frontend/scripts/compose-case-layers.mjs --family f01-progress-payment --check
 *   node frontend/scripts/compose-case-layers.mjs --family f01-progress-payment --dry-run
 *   node frontend/scripts/compose-case-layers.mjs --all
 *
 *   --check    compose in memory and diff against what is on disk.
 *              Exits 1 on any drift. This is the gate that says the
 *              committed playbooks are still what the spine produces.
 *   --dry-run  report what would be written, write nothing.
 *   --only CC[,CC]  write only these countries' pages. The gates still run
 *              over the whole family, because they are about relationships
 *              between layers; this narrows the files touched, which is
 *              what you want when several people add layers to one family.
 *   --keys     print the locale key delta (added / orphaned) and exit.
 *   --sharing  of the spine fields more than one country uses, how many
 *              compose to identical English. That is the number that
 *              could be translated once; the rest carry slot values and
 *              differ per country by design.
