"""Where a bill of quantities keeps its consumption tax, and where it does not.

Tax on a bill is a markup row of category ``tax``. There is no ``tax_rate``
column: ``BOQ`` does not declare one, the service never writes one, and
``BOQTotals`` says outright that the matching output fields hold their
defaults for wire compatibility only. The input schemas went on accepting a
rate anyway, with a worked example of ``0.19`` beside the field, and the two
write paths lost it differently - ``POST /boqs/`` dropped it and answered 201,
``PATCH /boqs/{id}`` reached ``update(BOQ).values(tax_rate=...)`` and raised
``CompileError: Unconsumed column names: tax_rate``, which the global handler
turns into a 500.

This file used to be the reason that looked covered. It asserted
``grand_total == net_total + tax_amount`` against a ``BOQWithSections`` it
built itself, with the tax arithmetic done in the test body. Nothing in the
service performs that arithmetic, so every assertion was about the test's own
multiplication and the schema's field list, and all of it passed while the
value was being thrown away one layer down.

What replaces it has to fail in both directions, so there are three groups:

* A rate is refused, on create and on update, with a message naming the markup
  row. Red if the guard is dropped and the value goes back to being lost.
* Omitting the field, and sending an explicit ``null``, both go through - to
  the service and to the database, not just to the schema. ``BOQListItem`` and
  ``BOQWithSections`` still emit ``tax_rate``, so a client that reads a bill
  and sends the object back carries a null, and it is the caller that must not
  be refused. Red if the guard over-fires.
* The path that does carry tax still prices: a ``category == "tax"`` markup
  reaches the grand total through ``compute_boq_totals``. Red if the refusal
  is ever "fixed" by taking the real tax route out with it.

The last group is the one with teeth. A test that only proves ``None`` is
accepted would pass against a module where tax did not work at all.
