"""A request for a file that is not there must be told so.

The SPA fallback answers any unmatched path with ``index.html``, which is
correct for client-side routes and wrong for assets. A browser holding a stale
``index.html`` asks for a hashed bundle that a redeploy has deleted, gets HTML
back with status 200 and a ``text/html`` content type, and fails inside the
module loader. What the operator then sees is a syntax error in a script, which
is several steps from "that file is gone" and is where the debugging starts.
The 200 also invites the browser and every proxy between to keep the answer.

This is the same failure the ``/health`` and ``/openapi.json`` aliases already
exist to prevent, written up there as making a sick service look healthy to a
probe. The reasoning was never carried across to assets.

The discriminator is what the request is asking for rather than what it looks
like it might be. A file request is one whose suffix is a type this server
serves, or anything at all under the ``/assets`` mount, where the bundler puts
nothing else. Client-side routes have no suffix, and a route whose last segment
happens to contain a dot keeps its ``index.html`` unless that suffix is one we
would have served.
