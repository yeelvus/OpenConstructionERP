# DDC-CWICR-OE: DataDrivenConstruction - OpenConstructionERP
"""``served_routes`` sees a module's routes, WebSockets included.

The case this exists for could not be expressed before. ``served_routes`` used
FastAPI's own ``iter_route_contexts``, which resolves HTTP paths correctly and
yields an EMPTY path for every ``APIWebSocketRoute``. A module whose only routes
are WebSockets therefore served nothing as far as
:meth:`ModuleLoader._has_live_routes` could tell, and that method decides
whether an enable has to mount the router again. Wrong on FastAPI 0.141, which
is what CI installs and what any fresh install resolves to under the
``fastapi>=0.116,<1`` pin, and right on the older releases the local
virtualenvs happen to carry - so nothing here was red.

Routers are mounted through ``include_router`` with a prefix, the way
``ModuleLoader._load_module`` mounts a real module, because that is the shape
whose behaviour changed. Declaring the same routes directly on the application
exercises a different code path and would pass either way.

No database and no application: a bare ``FastAPI`` is enough, and keeping it
bare is what lets this run in a lane that does not boot PostgreSQL.
