"""Locate the match service's tuning data in a checkout, a wheel and a bundle.

``data/match`` holds four small files that tune matching without a code
deploy: two JSON profiles read by ``config.py`` and two YAML overlays read by
``region_language.py`` and ``boosts/region.py``. All four are optional by
design and every reader falls back to hardcoded constants when they are
absent, which is exactly what makes locating them worth its own module. The
fallback is silent and produces plausible results, so a resolver pointing at
the wrong directory raises nothing, logs nothing at warning level and changes
only the quality of the answers.

The three readers used to reach the repo root by counting fixed parent
directories, and counting only ever works in a source checkout. After ``pip
install`` the same count lands in the virtualenv's ``Lib``; in a frozen
desktop bundle it lands above ``sys._MEIPASS``. Neither holds the data, so
every packaged install has run on the hardcoded baseline for the whole life of
the feature and said so nowhere. This is the third time the same arithmetic
has been fixed in this codebase, after ``app/core/partner_pack/discovery.py``
and ``app/modules/catalog/router.py``.

It is replaced here rather than corrected, because a corrected count is still
a count and the next reader added at a different depth gets it wrong again.
Two of the three readers sat at one depth and the third at another, which is
how one of them kept a wrong constant while looking exactly like the others.
The depth is derivable instead: a module's dotted name states how many
directories separate its file from the top-level package, so
``app.core.match_service.config`` is three below ``app`` and
``app.core.match_service.boosts.region`` is four, whatever the tree above
``app`` looks like.

Two candidate roots are then tried, because a checkout puts the package one
level deeper than an install does. ``site-packages/app`` has the data directly
beside it, which is where ``backend/pyproject.toml`` force-includes it and
where ``desktop/pyinstaller.spec`` freezes it; ``backend/app`` has ``backend``
above it and the data at the repo root above that. Each candidate is checked
for content rather than for its name, so a directory that merely happens to be
called ``match`` cannot answer for the real one.

Resolved per call rather than once at import. An import-time constant freezes
whatever the process saw first, which is wrong for a test that builds a layout
and for any caller that reloads, and it was its own separate defect in the
catalogue fix.
