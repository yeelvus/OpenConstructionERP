"""Validation engine - configurable rule-based data validation.

This is a FIRST-CLASS component of OpenEstimate. Every data import and
modification passes through validation. Rules are organized into rule sets
(e.g., "din276", "gaeb", "boq_quality") that can be enabled per project.

Architecture:

    ├── RuleSet (named collection of rules, e.g. "din276")
    └── ValidationRule (individual rule with validate() method)
