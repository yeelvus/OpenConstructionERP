"""The hour unit must be labelled as an hour in every backend locale.

``units.h`` is the only time-valued key in the backend catalogue, and it is the
only one where a mistranslation changes a number rather than a word. Every
other key names a dimension - a metre is a metre in any language - so a wrong
label there reads as clumsy. A wrong label here reads as a different quantity:
the value beside it is an hourly figure, so a label naming a longer period
misstates it by the length of that period.

Three locales carried such a label, and they were not three instances of one
fault. Two of them named a longer period and one named no period at all:

  * zh said 工日 and ja said 人工, the worker-day of Chinese and Japanese
    estimating practice. The convention behind them is real - CJK estimating
    does quantify labour in worker-days - and it was applied to the label
    without being applied to the number, which is what made it wrong. For
    these two a conversion factor at least exists, whether or not we want it.
  * ko said 인, which is 人, a person. That is a COUNT, not a period. It puts
    a headcount beside a rate, and no multiplier of any working day makes it
    true. A later pass that treats all three as one problem and applies a
    worker-day factor to Korean would make Korean worse, not better. 인 was
    also the only time unit ko had: ``units.h`` is the sole time-valued key in
    the catalogue, so before this fix the Korean file had no word for an hour
    at all.

The platform already has the honest way to express a worker-day: ``BASE_UNITS``
in frontend/src/features/boq/boqHelpers.ts offers ``day``, ``shift`` and ``mh``
as tokens of their own, and ``LOCALE_UNITS`` offers 工日, 人日 and 인일 beside
小时, 時間 and 시간 - so a worker-day is a unit a bill can be written in, not a
translation of the hour. Note the asymmetry there too: 工日 and 인 are both
tokens that picker offers, so those two labels collided with a different unit
the product itself sells, while 人工 is offered nowhere in the product at all.

What the label may say, from data the platform already holds:

  * ``h``, the ISO 80000-3 symbol for the hour, which is valid unchanged in
    every language and is what nine of these files already use;
  * an abbreviation of the platform's own name for the hour in that language,
    taken from ``units.h`` in frontend/src/app/locales/<locale>.ts. Danish
    ``t`` for ``Time``, German ``Std`` for ``Stunde``, Thai ``ชม.`` for
    ``ชั่วโมง`` and Czech ``hod`` for ``Hodina`` are all this shape, so the
    test reads an abbreviation as a subsequence rather than a prefix.

Two shapes of check were tried first and rejected against the data:

  * asserting the label is not a string the same locale offers as a different
    unit. da and no give ``units.t`` and ``units.h`` the same value ``t`` -
    tonne and time - so this reds on correct Danish and Norwegian;
  * a list of the three known-bad strings. That is the right answer by a
    mechanism that cannot produce a wrong one, and it stays green for ever.

Limit of this check, stated because it is not visible from a pass: the two
catalogues are its two witnesses, so a label wrong in both the same way is not
caught. It also cannot speak for a locale whose frontend name for the hour is
still the untranslated English word, because then the platform holds no name in
that language to compare against; the count of those is asserted below so the
gate cannot go quiet without saying so.
