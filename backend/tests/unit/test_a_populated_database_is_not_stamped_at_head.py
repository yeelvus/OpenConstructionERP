"""Stamping a populated, unstamped database destroys the only evidence it is odd.

Releases before 15.4.0 shipped no ``alembic.ini``, so their databases record no
revision at all. On boot ``create_all`` creates whatever tables are wholly
absent and cannot alter the ones already there, which leaves such a database
part-migrated. Stamping head over the top then claims a schema state nothing
verified, and the absent revision was the only durable record that the database
was not at head.

Refusing to stamp is reversible; the database can always be stamped later once
the repair for this cohort is decided. Stamping is not. While the decision is
open, these tests pin the reversible branch.
