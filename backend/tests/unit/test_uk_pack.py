"""The UK pack, and the ninety-seven checks it promised and did not have.

``enables_rule_ids`` reads as a promise: switching this document on turns
these checks on. The UK pack declared 97 ids across seven documents and the
engine defined none of them. That is worse than the checks being absent,
because an absent check does not tell an estimator the platform is watching
something it is not.

The gate below is stated as a property over every pack rather than over this
one, with an explicit allowlist naming the packs still carrying the defect and
the size of it. Written that way it goes red twice: when a clean pack starts
declaring a rule that does not exist, and when a listed pack is fixed and its
entry goes stale. A list that only ever gets longer is not a gate.

The end-to-end assertions matter more than the wiring ones. A rule that reads
a field nothing writes passes every test built from its own fixtures, so the
shipped UK demo project is run through the real rules here and its findings
are read.
