"""An escalation that cannot be resolved never reaches the cascade.

The failure this pins used to work like this: a markup line named a cost-index
series, the series had been deleted or was missing one of the two months, the
lookup logged a warning and returned nothing, and the cascade then priced the
line at zero. The bill came out with a grand total that looked finished and was
short by the whole escalation. Nothing on the screen and nothing in the number
said so.

So resolution happens before the cascade and fails there. Where somebody is
committing to a figure it refuses, naming the series and both periods. Where it
cannot refuse, the multi-bill totals rollup and the markups list endpoint, the
unresolved lines are kept out of the stack and the total is flagged as
incomplete. Zero is never the answer.
