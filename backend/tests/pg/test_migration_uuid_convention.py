"""Migrations must not declare new native PostgreSQL UUID columns.

``Base.metadata.create_all`` is the source of truth for our schema, and it
emits ``character varying(36)`` for every identity column: measured across all
598 tables, 597 are ``varchar(36)``, one is ``varchar(64)``, and none are
``uuid``. That is because ``GUID`` in ``app.database`` is a ``TypeDecorator``
whose ``impl`` is ``String(36)`` with no ``load_dialect_impl``, so it renders
the same on every dialect.

A migration that declares ``postgresql.UUID`` therefore describes a column
shape that ``create_all`` never produces. Nothing breaks today, because the
canonical install runs ``create_all`` and stamps the head without walking the
chain, so those declarations are not executed.

They are reachable two ways, and this file was written knowing only the first.
One is a walk of the whole chain from base, which fails on a child declared
``document_id uuid`` whose parent ``id`` a String(36) revision built as
``varchar(36)``. The other is a one-step downgrade of a merge node: alembic
un-applies everything reachable only through the parent it is not going to and
re-applies all of it on the way back up, against tables ``create_all`` left
standing. That one is executed - ``tests/integration/test_migrations_roundtrip.py``
runs it on every revision in its window - and it is the reason twenty-six
entries have left the list below.

The decision recorded here is that the divergence is frozen rather than
repaired. Reconciling all of it would mean rewriting every revision that
declares these columns, which is a multi-day project gated on questions nobody
has answered. This guard does the affordable half: it stops the gap growing.
The allowlist below is closed. A new entry is not the fix.

Frozen is not the same as untouchable, and the two rules are not in tension.
The list is closed to growth; it is expected to shrink, and
``test_allowlist_has_no_stale_entries`` makes a repair that does not shrink it
a failure. Twenty-six entries have left that way: every revision that sits
inside some merge node's one-step downgrade span, where the divergence is not
dormant but fatal, and where no follow-up revision can help because the walk
dies inside the offending ``upgrade()`` at the CREATE TABLE carrying the
foreign key.

Sixteen of the twenty-six were found by running the one walk the round trip
exercises, one error at a time. The other ten were found by measuring the graph
instead, and nothing has ever executed them: they sit in spans no test walks.
Five of the ten hang a foreign key off a uuid column - three of those behind an
interpolated target string, which is the shape a probe demanding a literal
reports clean - and five declare uuid identity columns that a revision later in
the same span can point a ``varchar(36)`` foreign key at, failing in the other
direction. That is why the line is drawn at the span rather than at the foreign
key: a span with no native uuid in it cannot produce either mismatch, and no
name has to be resolved to say so.

The twenty-four that remain sit outside every merge span, whichever parent a
downgrade names. No walk reaches them and they stay frozen.

The revisions are read with ``ast`` rather than imported, for the same reasons
as ``test_alembic_single_head``: importing them drags in ``app.database`` and a
PostgreSQL URL, and an unrelated import error anywhere in the 300-plus files
would silently disable the check.

The rule is deliberately coarse: any reference to a native UUID type in a
revision is a violation, whether or not this file can prove it reaches a
column. That is not laziness, it is the lesson from building the precise
version first. No current offender writes the type inline, because the same
revision has to work on SQLite, so the type reaches the column through at
least one indirection::

    guid_type = sa.String(36) if is_sqlite else sa.dialects.postgresql.UUID(as_uuid=True)
    sa.Column("document_id", guid_type, nullable=False)

A detector matching ``sa.Column`` arguments literally sees a bare name and
passes. Resolving assignments fixes that case and still missed
``v3012_equipment``, which returns the type from a helper and receives it as a
function parameter::

    def _guid_type(is_sqlite): return sa.String(36) if is_sqlite else postgresql.UUID()
    def _base_columns(guid_type): return [sa.Column("id", guid_type, primary_key=True)]

Every indirection added to the detector is a new way to fall through it, and a
site the guard cannot resolve counts as clean - which is how a guard ends up
enforcing nothing. Matching the type reference itself has no such gap.

The one exemption is ``existing_type=``. A migration that repairs the
divergence has to name ``UUID`` to say what the column is being converted
*from*, and that is the direction we want, not a new violation.
