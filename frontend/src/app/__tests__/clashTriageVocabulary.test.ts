 * The clash page names a severity and a status by building the key from the

 * closed and both are decided by the server - CLASH_SEVERITIES and
 * CLASH_STATUSES in `backend/app/modules/clash/schemas.py` - so every value has
 * exactly one key and the set of keys is knowable.
 *
 * The severity half of that had no key in any of the 40 locales. Nothing
 * reported it: a missing key falls back to the defaultValue, which here is the
 * raw server value, so a German coordinator read "critical / high / medium /
 * low" on a screen that was otherwise entirely in German, and the orphan-key
 * scan cannot see a family whose keys are assembled at runtime.
 *
 * This asserts the vocabulary is complete in every locale, which is the part a
 * scan of call sites cannot answer, and that one locale really resolves it
 * through the bundle rather than only carrying the line.

 * The base language a regional code falls back to, or null if there is none.

 * The defect this suite catches is a reader seeing another language, which is
 * what happens when `de` has no key and i18next reaches `en`. A regional code
 * reaching its own base is a different thing: i18next resolves `en-US` through
 * ['en-US', 'en'], so the American reader gets English either way, and
 * `en-US.ts` is deliberately an overlay of about fifteen hundred words that
 * differ rather than a locale in its own right (see
 * `enUSFallsBackToEnglish.test.ts`). Requiring the full vocabulary of it asks
 * it to stop being an overlay.
 *
 * So the same-language hop is allowed and the cross-language one is not. That
 * also covers es-MX, es-CL, es-CO and pt-BR, which do carry the whole set
 * today: were one of them to lose a key, the reader would still be reading
 * Spanish or Portuguese, and that is not what this file is for.
