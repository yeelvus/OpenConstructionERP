"""Localized labels and guarded coverage maths for requirements.

The deliverable coverage roll-up in :mod:`app.modules.requirements.evaluator`
is language-neutral, but the status and priority words shown next to it were
English only, and the coverage percentage was worked out inline. These pure
helpers give that a localized, guarded surface with no database, ORM, or
``app.*`` import, so they unit-test on any runner.

Priorities follow the MoSCoW convention (must / should / could / will not have),
an international requirements-management standard, not any one product.
