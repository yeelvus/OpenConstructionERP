# What a module says it does with inference, and the three states that are easy
# to collapse into each other.
#
# The register this feeds answers the question "which of these modules performs
# inference, and on what". It is only worth answering if a module that has never
# been read is distinguishable from one that was read and found to do nothing,
# and if a claim that something is not an AI system has to carry its reason. Both
# are properties of the declaration type rather than of any module, so they are
# pinned here rather than in a gate over the tree.
