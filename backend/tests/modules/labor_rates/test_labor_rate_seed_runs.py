"""The starter rate library has to survive contact with the real schema.

``_seed_demo_account`` calls this seeder inside a ``try/except`` that logs a
warning and carries on, which is the right behaviour at boot and the reason a
seeder written against a remembered field list can ship broken: the page stays
empty and nothing fails. So the seeder is run here against the real tables
rather than read.

Two runs in a row are the point of the second test. The seeder is called on
every startup, and its idempotency key is the template name, so a second pass
that inserted anything would double the library on the first restart.
