# ── Basemap (public) ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# WHY THE BROWSER NEVER TALKS TO THE TILE HOST. Ad and privacy blockers
# routinely block public tile CDNs by hostname, which leaves the 3D globe and
# the project-card thumbnails blank. We proxy every basemap byte through our
# own origin: the browser only ever fetches same-origin ``/api`` (which
# blockers do not touch) and the server fetches once, with a proper
# User-Agent, and caches. These are intentionally the only public routes in
# this module: ``<img>`` tags and the Cesium / MapLibre loaders cannot attach
# an auth header, and basemap tiles are public imagery.
#
# WHY OPENFREEMAP, AND WHY THIS COMMENT NAMES THE ALTERNATIVES. The upstream
# used to be CARTO's keyless "Voyager" raster. It is keyless no longer: as of
# 2026-08 it answers 200, ``image/png``, ~26 KB of a perfectly decodable image
# of the correct geography with "API KEY REQUIRED" printed diagonally across
# it. Every field of that HTTP response is correct, so a status check, a
# byte-length check and an image-decode check are all green - the refusal
# lives only in the pixels. That is the failure this module is now built
# against, and ``tests/unit/test_basemap_upstream_policy.py`` holds the
# allowlist of upstreams we consider keyless and policy-compatible, with the
# reason for each written down.
#
#   * ``tile.openstreetmap.org`` is NOT an option however well it works
#     today: the OSMF Tile Usage Policy forbids proxying and systematic or
#     app use, and they enforce by User-Agent. It would work now and get us
#     banned as installs grow.
#   * OpenFreeMap is keyless, quota-free, ODbL, and self-hostable, which is
#     the property that matters most: an operator who outgrows the public
#     endpoint points OE_BASEMAP_UPSTREAM at their own copy.

    no key, and cannot be withdrawn from under us. The interactive maps are
    unaffected - they read vector tiles and render streets client-side. The
    two surfaces that cannot consume vector data, the ``<img>`` card
    thumbnail and the Cesium globe, show relief instead of streets. That is
    a real and deliberate downgrade in detail, taken over serving a
