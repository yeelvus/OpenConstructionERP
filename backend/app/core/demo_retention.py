"""Retention policy for visitor uploads on the public hosted demo.

Off by default, and off by construction rather than by configuration
discipline. Nothing in this module deletes anything unless BOTH of these are
true at the moment the sweep runs:

1. ``OE_DEMO_READ_ONLY`` is on (``demo_read_only`` on
   :class:`app.config.Settings`) - the same flag that already declares "this
   deployment is the public demo" for :mod:`app.core.demo_read_only`. There is
   one idea here, not two: a self-hosted install never sets it, so a
   self-hosted install can never take any branch below.
2. ``OE_DEMO_UPLOADS_RETENTION_DAYS`` is a positive integer. Zero, the
   default, means "keep everything forever", which is what every install that
   is not the hosted demo does today and keeps doing.

A fat-fingered retention window on a self-hosted box therefore deletes
nothing, because that box is not a read-only demo. That is the whole point of
the conjunction: the destructive half of the switch is inert without the half
that says which deployment this is.

Why a demo needs this at all
----------------------------
The hosted demo is a public sandbox. Its data directory grows with every
visitor who drops a model, a drawing or a takeoff PDF into it, and until now
nothing ever removed any of it. The seeded example projects are the product;
a stranger's 223 MB IFC from three weeks ago is not, and it has no claim on
the disk that the nightly database dump needs.

What is protected, structurally
-------------------------------
*Seeded rows.* Every seeder in the platform stamps its rows with a truthy
``seed`` (and usually ``demo``) key in the row's own JSON metadata column -
see ``app/modules/*/seed.py``, e.g. ``metadata_={"seed": True, "demo": True}``
in ``app.modules.bim_hub.seed``. :func:`is_seeded_row` reads that marker off
the row itself, so the rule is a property of the record and not of its
filename, its directory, its age or the project it hangs off. A visitor who
uploads into a demo project is still a visitor; a seeded file that a visitor
renamed is still seeded.

*Rows that cannot answer the question.* A row whose metadata column is
missing or is not a JSON object cannot prove it is a visitor upload, and
"unknown" is resolved as keep, never as delete. A source whose model has no
metadata column of its own is not in :data:`UPLOAD_SOURCES` at all.

*Blobs somebody else still points at.* Blobs are shared across tables here:
opening a Project-Files PDF in takeoff references the same bytes rather than
copying them (see ``preserve_blobs_for_deleted_source`` in
``app.modules.takeoff.service``), and a soft-deleted file keeps its blob alive
through ``oe_file_trash.payload_json`` while its own row is already gone. So a
blob is only unlinked once no live row anywhere in the registry - and no trash
snapshot - still names that exact path.

The order, and what a half-finished run leaves behind
-----------------------------------------------------
Per candidate: delete the row, commit, then delete the blob. Never the other
way round. The two possible residues after a kill -9 are not symmetric:

* row first - the process dies owning a blob nothing references. Invisible,
  costs disk, and is recoverable by hand (or, for BIM, by the existing
  ``POST /api/v1/bim_hub/cleanup-orphans/``).
* blob first - the process dies owning a row that points at bytes which are
  gone. The demo shows a file that 404s on download, and no sweep can put the
  bytes back.

Only the first one is recoverable, which is why the platform's own deletes
already choose it - ``app.modules.bim_hub.service`` line 1259 puts blob
cleanup "after DB delete so we never strand files belonging to a still-live
DB row", and ``app.modules.documents.service.delete_document`` says the same.
Committing per candidate rather than per batch bounds that residue to a
single blob no matter when the process dies.

Safe to run twice: the second run finds no candidate rows, because the rows
it would have selected are gone. Safe to interrupt: see above. Safe to run as
a dry run: :func:`sweep_demo_uploads` with ``dry_run=True`` performs every
query and every size probe and issues no DELETE and no unlink.

It says what it did
-------------------
Every run - dry runs, and runs that deleted nothing - writes
``demo_retention_last_run.json`` into the data directory, atomically, and logs
one machine-readable INFO line. A stale timestamp in that file is itself the
signal that the job stopped running, which is the failure this whole module
exists downstream of: the component that first noticed the disk filling up
wrote a line into a log nobody read.

Three flags in that artifact carry the states a watchdog has to tell apart.
``armed`` false with a ``skipped_reason`` means nothing was asked of this
deployment, which is the healthy answer on a self-hosted install. ``failed``
true with a ``failure`` means the run was wanted and did not happen, and needs
a person - the CLI exits 1 for that and 2 for the first. ``capped`` true means
the run stopped at :data:`MAX_ROWS_PER_SOURCE` with backlog still behind it,
so a large ``rows_deleted`` is not the same as a finished source.
