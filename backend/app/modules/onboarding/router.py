"""Onboarding provisioning API (auto-mounted at /api/v1/onboarding).

The wizard POSTs the heavy first-run work here instead of awaiting it inline.
Each requested item becomes a background JobRun; the endpoint returns the job
ids immediately so the client can move the user on and poll for a progress bar.
Jobs are de-duplicated per user and item through an idempotency key, so a
double submit (or a retried request) reuses the running job rather than
starting a second import. A job that FAILED is not reused: provisioning the
same item again starts a fresh attempt.

Reading job state:

    GET  /jobs/        - the caller's onboarding jobs, newest first
    GET  /jobs/{id}    - one of the caller's onboarding jobs (404 otherwise)
    POST /status       - the caller's jobs among a list of ids (what the wizard polls)

The generic ``/api/v1/jobs`` routes stay admin-only, because ``JobRun`` has no
owner column. These routes can serve a non-admin because onboarding stamps the
caller's id into each job payload and every read here filters on it, together
with the onboarding job kinds, so one user can never read another's jobs, or
unrelated background work, by guessing ids.
