/**
 * Poll-after-abort fallback for `POST /v1/costs/vector/index/`.
 *
 * Indexing embeds the whole loaded cost catalogue (~55K items per CWICR
 * region, several hundred thousand on a multi-region install) and may spend
 * up to 30s loading the embedding model before it embeds anything. Every call
 * site opts into the 5-min `longRunning` budget, but on a small box even that
 * can run out - and when the client aborts, the server does NOT stop: there is
 * no disconnect cancellation on that handler, so it keeps embedding and
 * commits. Reporting "timed out" for work that actually landed is a lie the
 * user cannot act on (GitHub #436).
 *
 * Same shape as the CWICR region-import fallback in `ImportDatabasePage`
 * (which polls `/v1/costs/regions/stats/` after its own abort): read the
 * count before the write, and if the write aborts, watch the count until the
 * work shows up or the poll budget runs out.

 * outside - the catalogue lands, the index does not, nothing says so, and the
 * first symptom is that search finds nothing days later.
 *
 * The two directions are different facts and must not share a message:
 *
 * A client abort means WE stopped listening. That endpoint has no disconnect
 * cancellation, so the server is still embedding and will still commit. The
 * wrapper's own "the request took too long and was cancelled" is false about
 * the half the user cares about, which is why these callers suppress it - the
 * honest report is that indexing is running, not that anything was cancelled.
 *
 * Any other error is the server's own answer (503 with no embedder installed
 * is the common one) and means the index will NOT appear. That is the case
 * worth interrupting someone for, and today it is the case that says nothing
 * at all.
 *
 * Reports through the toast store directly rather than a component's `t`, so
 * a five-minute abort still reaches the user on whatever screen they have
 * moved on to - a first-run import is normally followed by leaving the page.
