"""Where the catalogue directory resolves, in an install as well as a checkout.

``app/modules/catalog/router.py`` located the locally generated catalogue CSVs
by counting five parent directories up from its own file. That reaches the repo
root in a source checkout and the virtualenv's ``Lib`` in a pip or desktop
install, where no ``data`` directory has ever existed. Measured on the installed
venv in this tree, the old expression produced
``.venv-run/Lib/data/catalog/regions``.

Unlike the packs defect this mirrors, the consequence was not an empty page: the
lookup falls through to a GitHub download, so an online host kept working and
nothing ever complained. An offline or air-gapped host got nothing at all, and
every install silently spent a network round trip on data it was supposed to
find on disk.

The second half of the same tuple was wrong for a different reason.
``Path.cwd()`` was evaluated once, at import, so a process that changed
directory afterwards kept answering for the directory it no longer ran in.
Resolving per call is what fixes that, and it is asserted here directly.

Deliberately not here: any claim that a released artefact carries the data. It
does not, by decision. ``desktop/pyinstaller.spec`` records that at the top of
the file and NOTICE carries the reason, and
``test_catalog_offline_lookup.test_catalog_regions_are_not_bundled_in_the_package``
already pins it. This file is about the resolver only, which is why the
installed-layout cases build their own synthetic tree rather than looking for
one in the wheel.

Every case below is filesystem work against a synthetic layout, so the source
checkout this runs in cannot supply the answer by accident.
