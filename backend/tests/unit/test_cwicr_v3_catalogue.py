# DDC-CWICR-OE: DataDrivenConstruction · OpenConstructionERP
"""Unit tests for the CWICR v3 catalogue registry.

Covers:

* Master list invariants (30 rows, unique regions, every language has
  at least one available row OR all coming-soon).
* ``get_catalogue`` lookup — case-insensitive, exact match (no alias
  resolution to avoid silently-wrong restores).
* Each row maps to a real ``cwicr_{lang}_v3`` collection consistent
  with :mod:`region_language`.

    The two layouts in :func:`test_ddc_path_starts_with_lang_directory` are not
    interchangeable any more. DDC stopped publishing v3 snapshots to GitHub LFS
    when the bandwidth cap kept getting hit, and the flat
    ``<LANG>___DDC_CWICR/`` paths written into this file are dead there today -
    a HEAD on one answers 404 while the HF path for the same region answers
    302. What keeps that from being a live defect is ``_apply_hf_overrides``,
    which rewrites every published region's ``ddc_path`` to the HF layout at
    import time, so the literals above are documentation and the runtime value
    is what installs.

    That leaves exactly one way to break it: mark a row available without
    giving it an HF path. ``install_v3_catalogue`` picks its base URL by
    looking for ``___DDC_CWICR`` in the path, so such a row would send Qdrant
    to a GitHub URL that no longer exists and the install would fail at
    download with nothing in the registry looking wrong.

    No row carries a legacy path today. ZH_CHINA and TR_NATIONAL used to, and
    the 409 for an unpublished region was the only thing keeping them off a
    dead URL, until both turned out to have been published all along under
    their pre-rename ids. So this finds nothing at the moment and regains its
    force the first time a genuinely pending region is added, which is why it
    reads the tuple rather than naming regions.
