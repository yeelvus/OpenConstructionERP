"""The upgrade path for the one timestamp column that was declared naive.

``classified_at`` is now ``DateTime(timezone=True)`` like the other 197 module
timestamps, which fixes a fresh installation outright. It does not fix an
existing one: module tables here are built by ``create_all`` and topped up by an
auto-migrator that only ever adds columns, so an upgraded database keeps the
naive column it was created with. ``widen_classified_at`` is what closes that,
and this is the test that it does.

The test is in two parts because the two risks are separable and one of them
cannot be reached through the real table. Retyping is cheap to verify against
the real table and the real function. Preserving the instant needs a stored
value, and storing one means satisfying a foreign key to a project and every
NOT NULL column beside it, which would test the projects module rather than this
one. So the instant is verified against a table of the same shape, under a
session time zone deliberately set away from UTC: with the ``USING ... AT TIME
ZONE 'UTC'`` clause the stored moment survives, and without it PostgreSQL reads
the naive value in the session's zone and the assertion moves by hours.
