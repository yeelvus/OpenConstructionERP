"""The HTTP surface over the bundled licence texts.

Mounted on a bare FastAPI app rather than through ``create_app``, so these run
without a database and without importing 190 modules. That the real app mounts
it is a separate question and is checked in
``tests/integration/test_license_texts_api.py``.

The traversal test matters more than it looks. The handler cannot traverse by
construction, because it matches the requested name against a listing of the
directory instead of joining it onto one, so this test can only ever pass. It
is here so that a later rewrite which does join a path has something that goes
red. It asserts on the refusal message as well as the status, because a 404
from Starlette's router and a 404 from our own listing look identical from the
outside, and only one of them is evidence about this handler.
