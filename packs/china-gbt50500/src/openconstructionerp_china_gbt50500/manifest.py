"""Build the ``PartnerPackManifest`` instance for the china-gbt50500 pack.

Kept in its own module so unit tests can import the manifest without
triggering the package ``__init__`` side-effects.

Validation this pack switches on:
  * ``gbt50500`` - two rules in the core engine, both over the bill of
    quantities item code. One requires the code to be present on every
    position, the other requires it to be a 9-digit or 12-digit numeric
    national code. That is the whole of it.

Standards the demo data is written against. These are reference context
for the reader; no engine rules exist behind them today:
  * GB 50500-2013 - 建设工程工程量清单计价规范 (pricing code for
    construction works). Drives the 9-digit national item codes used in
    the demo BoQ (e.g. 010101001).
  * GB 50854-2013 - 房屋建筑与装饰工程工程量计算规范 (quantity
    calculation code for buildings and decoration works).
  * GB 50010-2010 - 混凝土结构设计规范 (code for design of concrete
    structures).
  * GB 50011-2010 - 建筑抗震设计规范 (code for seismic design of
    buildings).
  * GB 50009-2012 - 建筑结构荷载规范 (load code for building
    structures).
  * GB 50016-2014 - 建筑设计防火规范 (code for fire protection design
    of buildings).
  * GB/T 50378-2019 - 绿色建筑评价标准 (assessment standard for green
    building).

Edition. The pack states GB 50500-2013 because that is the edition the
shipped item codes were authored against and the only one whose text we
have. GB/T 50500-2024 superseded it from 2025-09-01, along with the
GB/T 50854-2024 measurement family; neither text could be obtained, so
the pack does not claim conformance to them. Note the prefix while
reading the two: the 2013 edition is GB, a mandatory code, and the 2024
edition is GB/T, a recommended standard.

Tax model:
  * cn_vat_9 - VAT general tax method (一般计税) at 9% output VAT on
    construction services, shown as a separate cumulative line on top of
    the tax-exclusive direct cost. Enterprise management fee, statutory
    charges (规费), profit and the safe/civilised-construction fee are
    taken on the direct cost per the Shanghai cost build-up.

CWICR regions:
  * Only ``cwicr-zh-shanghai`` is wired in for the demo. Additional
    metros (Beijing / Shenzhen / Guangzhou / Chengdu) are listed in
    ``metadata.preferred_metros`` so the onboarding wizard can pre-fill
    the dropdown when those marketplace entries land.
