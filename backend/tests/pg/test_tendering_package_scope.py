"""PG: a package over part of a bill is levelled and compared against that part.

Both comparison screens load the package's BOQ, and a package covering a
quarter of a bill points at the whole thing. Until the package's own scope was
read, the other three quarters landed on the reference side of the matrix,
where every bidder counted as having omitted them: each out-of-scope line was
imputed at the bidder's own mean rate, so a bid levelled to roughly four times
what it quoted and the budget comparison measured it against four times its own
budget. Both numbers are what the screens exist to show.

This has to run against a real cluster. The arithmetic is pure, but the failure
lives in the join between a stored package's metadata and a stored BOQ's
positions, and a unit test over the filter alone cannot see whether either
screen calls it - which is exactly how the gap shipped.

Gated by ``OE_TEST_DB=pg`` (see conftest).
