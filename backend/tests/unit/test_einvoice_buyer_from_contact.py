"""The buyer party read off the contact an invoice already names.

Until this existed no screen could write a buyer address at all: the e-invoice
panel is read-only, and the contact form kept its address as one unstructured
line. That made BR-7 and BR-11, and later BR-DE-8 and BR-DE-9, impossible to
satisfy from the UI rather than merely inconvenient.

The tests below fix the two properties the rest of the feature rests on. The
contact is a floor, not a ceiling: a buyer typed onto one invoice still wins.
And nothing here parses the legacy free-text line, because a post code guessed
out of prose is exported as though someone had confirmed it.
