// Case: "Compile the tender control price and price a bid" (CN).
//
// State-funded work in China is priced twice on the same bill and by two
// different people. The owner's consultant compiles a control price on a
// published quota base, and the bidders price the same bill on what they can
// actually buy at. The interesting number is neither of them on its own, it is
// the distance between them, item by item.
//
// That duality is the case. Quota pricing expands a norm into hours and
// materials per unit and prices them from a book; market pricing puts the
// firm's own rates on the same items. Holding the two against each other is
// what tells an owner whether a bid is genuinely cheap or merely thin, and it
// is what tells a bidder where their price is exposed.
//
// The national cost base is downloaded through the ordinary import surface
// rather than shipped with the product, and provincial quota books are not part
// of it. Content strings are key plus inline English default and live only here.

    "Two pricing regimes sit on top of one bill of quantities and they answer different questions. A quota rate says what the work costs when it is done the way the norm assumes, with the hours and materials the book allocates to it; a market rate says what this firm can buy it for this year, on this site, with these suppliers. On public work both exist by design, because the owner needs a defensible ceiling compiled from a published base and the bidder needs a price it can actually deliver at. This case builds both on the same coded bill and then compares them item by item, which is where the useful information is. A bid twenty percent under the control price on earthworks and level on finishes is telling you something specific, and it is not the same thing as a bid twenty percent under overall.",
