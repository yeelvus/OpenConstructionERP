/**
 * CountryFlagBackdrop - a huge, barely-there flag watermark for pages scoped
 * to a selected country cost database (founder request 2026-06-06: pick the
 * German database and the page background carries a faint German flag).
 *
 * Composition contract: the page root adds `relative` and renders this as its
 * FIRST child. Deliberately NO z-index and NO `isolate` on the page root - a
 * per-page stacking context traps fixed z-50 modals under the sticky header
 * (modal_relative_isolate_trap). The wash paints at ~5% opacity and stays
 * non-interactive (pointer-events-none); fixed overlays still win.
 *
 * Accepts raw region keys ("DE_BERLIN", "USA_USD") or ISO codes ("de") - the
 * underlying CountryFlag resolves both. Renders nothing when no country is
 * selected, so pages can pass their state straight through.
 *
 * Two sizes, because a wash tuned for a full page reads as nothing at all
 * inside a block a few hundred pixels tall. `page` (the default) is unchanged.
 * `panel` is for a bounded region - the expanded body of one cost-base family,
 * say - where the flag has to be smaller and a little stronger to register.
 * Both keep the same nesting and the same mask.

          first frames of every country switch (founder report). Nested,
          the opacities multiply: the flag fades from 0 to 6%, never above. */}
