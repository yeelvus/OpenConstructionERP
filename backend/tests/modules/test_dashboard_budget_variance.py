"""The over-budget card counts money that is promised, not only money that is gone.

``variance.py`` was written because three callers each carried their own copy of
the rule and a correction reached one of them. This card was a fourth, and it
was missed because it spelled the subtraction differently: the others wrote
`revised - actual`, this one wrote `actual - planned`, so the gate that hunts
for the first shape could not see the second. Wording, not arithmetic, is what
kept it hidden.

The consequence is the one that matters on a dashboard. A project with 48.7
budgeted, 12.4 invoiced and 33.4 under signed order is 94% spoken for, and the
card whose whole job is to name over-budget projects left it off the list
entirely, because 12.4 is comfortably under 48.7.
