"""projects: retire the "waiting" status (duplicate of "on_hold").

Data-only migration. The project ``status`` column is a free-form varchar
(no DB enum), and the curated UI set dropped ``waiting`` because it was a
duplicate of ``on_hold``. This folds any existing live project rows that
still read ``waiting`` into ``on_hold`` so they keep rendering with a curated
badge instead of falling through to the humanised "Waiting" fallback.

Scope:
  * Touches ONLY ``oe_projects_project.status``.
  * ``oe_project_status_history`` is intentionally LEFT UNTOUCHED so the
    audit trail keeps its historical fidelity (a past "active -> waiting"
    transition stays as it actually happened).

The upgrade is idempotent (re-running matches nothing once converted) and
money-free. The downgrade is a deliberate no-op: ``waiting`` and ``on_hold``
are semantically identical and, once merged, the two populations are
indistinguishable, so there is nothing to safely restore - reverting must
not invent or lose data.
