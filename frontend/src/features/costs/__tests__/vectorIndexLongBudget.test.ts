// #436 - "Request timeout after 45000ms: POST /v1/costs/vector/index/". The
// 45s was ours: `api.ts` gives every call the default mutation budget unless
// the caller opts into `longRunning`. Vector indexing can spend 30s loading
// the embedding model before it embeds the first of ~55K items, so 45s is
// unwinnable at any catalogue size - and the server has no disconnect
// cancellation on that route, so it finishes and commits work the user was
// told had failed.
//
// This guard asserts the budget at EVERY call site, not at one of them. The
// count assertion is the load-bearing half: a regex that looks for
// `longRunning: true` near the endpoint passes silently when the matcher
// misses a site, so the census is pinned to a number and the named list is
// printed on failure. If you legitimately add or remove a call site, change
// EXPECTED_SITES here and confirm your new site carries the flag - that edit
// is the review this ratchet exists to force.
//
