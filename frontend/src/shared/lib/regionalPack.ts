/**
 * The two facts about a regional pack that more than one feature needs.
 *
 * Which country a pack serves, and which language it speaks, are asked by the
 * onboarding picker, by the dashboard card that names the active pack, and by
 * a case that wants to say which pack covers its market. Features in this
 * codebase do not import from each other - measured, there is not one
 * `@/features/x` import inside another feature - so the join has to live in
 * `shared` or be written three times. It was already written once in
 * `features/onboarding/partnerPacksApi.ts`, which now re-exports from here so
 * there is exactly one copy rather than a second that drifts.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT here: anything that needs the curated `COUNTRY_PACKS`
 * presets. Those are onboarding's own data and the offer logic that reads them
 * stays in `features/onboarding/countryOffer.ts`.
 */

/**
 * The subset of a pack that this module reads.
 *
 * Both `InstalledPartnerPack` (the onboarding list) and `PartnerPackManifest`
 * (the active-pack hook) satisfy it, which is the point: they are two names
 * for the same backend payload, and a caller should not have to know which one
 * it is holding to ask which country a pack is for.

 * pack declares to mean "no single market", and modular-prefab and

 * which the same envelope already carries, is what separates the first two.
 *

 * - us-california, us-costdata and us-texas all declare US - so this is a list

/**
 * The bands packs are offered in, most important first.

 * order, not a persuasive one. Forty-three cards alphabetised by slug put
 * `aus` first, `batimatech-ca` between Austria and Belgium because the sort
 * never sees the display name, and the United States at the very bottom. A
 * reader scanning that grid learns nothing about which pack matters to them.
 *
 * The order here is by construction market, largest first, which is the same
 * order the industry itself uses when it sizes these markets: the United
 * States, China, India, then Europe in aggregate. Everything else follows.
 * The bands are deliberately coarse, because a finer ranking would be a claim
 * we cannot support and would need re-litigating every year.
 *
 * `home` sits above all of them. A reader in Poland is not served by seeing
 * the United States first, however large that market is, and the whole point
 * of a country pack is that it carries the reader's own standards.
 *
 * Why Turkey and Russia are not in `europe`: the band is a standards family,
 * not a landmass. `europe` is the EN/Eurocode world plus the United Kingdom,
 * which is what makes those packs substitutable enough to sit together in one
 * group. Turkey prices against TS and Russia against GESN, so grouping either
 * under a European heading would tell a reader something untrue about what
 * the pack contains. Both land in `rest`, which claims nothing.
