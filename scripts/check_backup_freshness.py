"""Backup freshness guard: complain when the newest database dump is too old.

Production ran nine days with no database backup and nothing said so. The
nightly job was refusing correctly - it checked for free disk, found too
little, appended a line to its own log and exited. A refusal that is logged
and not delivered is worse than a crash: a crash wakes somebody, a refusal
accumulates, and the missing alarm gets read as evidence that the backup ran.

The obvious response is to alert when the backup fails, and on its own that
response is wrong. A job that stops being scheduled never fails. It emits no
exit code, no log line and no event, so anything watching for a failure waits
forever and stays green. The same is true of a unit that was disabled, a host
that was rebuilt without its cron, and a script somebody renamed.

So this guard does not watch the run. It watches the artefact, and asks the
opposite question: how old is the newest thing we could actually restore from.
That question has an answer whether the job failed, was never scheduled, or
never existed, which is the only phrasing that covers all three.

Four ways the answer can be bad, and all four are non-zero here:

  * ``stale``     - the newest dump is older than the threshold.
  * ``missing``   - there is no dump at all, or the directory is not there.
  * ``truncated`` - the newest dump is below the size floor. A dump killed
                    part-way through leaves a file with a *current* mtime, so
                    a check that only looks at age passes a torn file and the
                    operator finds out at restore time. One size comparison
                    closes that.
  * ``unknown``   - the check could not tell. Unreadable directory, a path
                    that is not a directory, bad arguments. This exits 2, not
                    0. A reader that returns a default when it fails reports a
                    fact about itself rather than about the backup, and this
                    codebase has been bitten by exactly that shape before.

Only ``fresh`` exits 0.

Where to run it. On the machine that writes the backups this guard is worth
little: it dies with the host it was meant to report on, and a host that is
gone reports nothing rather than reporting badly. Run it wherever the second
copy of the dumps lands - the object store, the standby box, the workstation
that pulls them - and let the exit code drive whatever already pages you. It
imports nothing from the application, so a monitoring box needs a Python and
this file and nothing else.

One requirement on the producer: it must write to a temporary name and rename
into place once the dump is complete. A dump written directly under its final
name is visible to this guard while it is still growing, and would be read as
a truncated artefact every night. Point ``--pattern`` at the finished name.

Usage (``--min-bytes`` is a placeholder: take it from the size of a good dump
on the install you are watching, not from this line):

    check_backup_freshness.py --dir /var/backups/postgresql \\
        --pattern '*.dump' --max-age-hours 26 --min-bytes 50000000

Exit codes: 0 fresh, 1 the backup is not good, 2 the check could not tell.

The operational half - prerequisites, cadence, choosing the threshold, and what
whoever receives the alert must do differently for exit 1 and exit 2 - is in
``docs/backup-monitoring.md``.
