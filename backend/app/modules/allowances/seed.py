"""Allowances demo seed - a populated contingency register per demo project.

Fills the allowances screen with the register an estimator actually keeps: the
provisional sums held for scope that is not yet designed, the prime-cost sums
held for items a supplier will price later, and the design / construction
contingencies carried on top - each with the drawdowns released against it as
the scope firmed up.

Every amount is scaled from the project's OWN estimate (the sum of its BOQ line
item totals), so a warehouse and a hospital do not carry the same provisional
sums and a reader who compares the register against the estimate on the next
screen finds the proportions plausible. Amounts are rounded the way a person
rounds them, which is why the register does not read as generated.

The register is deliberately mixed: some allowances are untouched, some are
partly released, one is settled to the penny (remaining exactly zero), and
exactly one is over-drawn - the advisory state the module treats as first class
and shows with an "Over-drawn" badge. A register in which the badge never fires
teaches half the feature.

Amounts are derived, never hardcoded, so a demo whose BOQ is re-priced keeps a
register in proportion to it.

Acts on the demo estate only, and on all of it. Every project handed in is
considered - there is no "flagship plus a few" cap, which is how a screen ends
up permanently empty on the projects that fell outside it. A project outside the
estate is declined outright rather than merely skipped as already-seeded: see
:func:`_is_demo_project`. On top of that, a project that already carries an
allowance is left untouched, so a re-run never doubles the register.
