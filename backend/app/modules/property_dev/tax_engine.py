"""Property-dev jurisdiction-aware tax / VAT / stamp-duty engine.

Pure-function library - every helper takes :class:`~decimal.Decimal`
in / returns Decimal out, never touches the DB, never raises HTTP
exceptions, and never reads the wall clock. The thin async wrapper in
``service.py`` resolves a contract to inputs and hands them to these
functions; the engine itself has zero side-effects so it can be
unit-tested in isolation and reused from the BOQ engine, the
finance module, or batch revenue-recognition jobs.

Design intent
-------------
* **Data-driven** - every rate lives in ``data/tax_rates.yaml`` (not in
  Python source). Adding a new jurisdiction = a YAML edit, not a code
  change.
* **Decimal everywhere** - no float arithmetic. Money is rounded
  ``ROUND_HALF_UP`` to 2 dp on output; intermediate maths uses 6 dp
  of precision so successive percentage applications don't drift.
* **Effective-date aware** - VAT bands carry ``effective_from``, and a
  contract signed before it is refused rather than priced. The table holds
  one band per rate class, not a history, so there is no earlier rate to
  apply and the engine says so instead of inventing one. Adding the
  historical band to the YAML is what makes such a date answerable.
* **No currency conversion** - the caller supplies the price in the
  contract's currency. Mixing currencies is a finance-module job, not
  a tax-engine job.
* **Unknown jurisdiction → explicit error** - never falls back to a
  silent default that would generate billing-incorrect invoices.

The full tax model for a property purchase is the sum of:

    grand_total = net
                + vat (or zero-rated / exempt)
                + stamp_duty / land-transfer tax
                + transfer_fee  (UAE DLD style)
                + registration_fee
                + late_interest (on overdue instalments)

Each line is itemised in :func:`compute_total_taxes_for_contract` and
exposed through the ``breakdown`` field so the frontend can render a
human-readable invoice row-by-row.
