"""RFI service - business logic for RFI management.

- Event publishing on create/update/delete
- Structured state-change logs (R5: keys = rfi_id / project_id /
  status_from / status_to / actor) so the SIEM ingest pipeline can pivot
  on transitions instead of regex-matching prose log lines
- Retry-on-IntegrityError for RFI-number collisions
  (R5 / BUG-RFI-UNIQ; mirrors the changeorders pattern)
- Respondent identity verification + assigner role gate
  (R5 / BUG-RFI-ROLE; the service is the source of truth, the router
  permission registry is only the coarse first-line filter)
