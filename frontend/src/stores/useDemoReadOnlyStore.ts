/**
 * One flag: the server has refused a write because this deployment is the
 * public demonstration.
 *
 * The refusal is recognised in `shared/lib/api.ts` and shown by
 * `shared/ui/DemoReadOnlyDialog.tsx`. This store is the seam between them, in
 * the same shape the transport already uses for the rate-limit toast: the
 * transport sets state on a zustand store and still throws, so nothing about
 * how a caller handles its own error changes.
 *
 * It carries a boolean and nothing else, deliberately.
 *
 * The refusal body also carries a plain English `message`, a fallback for
 * callers that are not this app. The screen shows its own translated text, so
 * that sentence must never reach a reader. Keeping it out of this store is how
 * that is enforced rather than merely intended: there is nothing here to
 * render, so no later edit can render it by accident.

   * several pending writes produces several refusals in the same instant, and
   * they are all one event to the person who clicked. Raising again would
   * re-run the dialog's mount effects - including the refetch that puts the
   * screen back to what the server holds - for no gain.
   *
   * Not once-per-session, though. A visitor who dismisses the dialog and then
   * tries to change something else is asking the same question again and is
   * owed the same answer.
