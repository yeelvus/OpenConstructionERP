"""Costs IDOR audit (v2.4.0 slice A — task #177).

The ``/api/v1/costs/`` router exposes endpoints keyed off
``cost_item_id`` (a.k.a. ``item_id`` in the URL). Unlike most other
modules in the platform, ``CostItem`` is a **shared catalog** — it has
no ``tenant_id`` / ``owner_id`` / ``user_id`` column. The catalog hosts
public reference data (CWICR and regional cost indices) that every tenant on the
deployment is expected to read, and write access is gated by RBAC
permissions (``costs.create`` / ``costs.update`` / ``costs.delete``) +
the admin role for destructive operations like
``DELETE /actions/clear-database/``.

That is a deliberate architectural choice, NOT an IDOR bug:

- Reads are public-by-design (matches autocomplete + search semantics).
- Writes require an editor-or-higher RBAC permission.
- Wholesale deletes require the admin role.

This module pins that contract so a future regression — e.g. someone
adding a per-tenant cost field but forgetting to filter on it — surfaces
as a red test. The cases below cover:

1. A non-privileged user (viewer) cannot create a global cost item.
2. A non-privileged user (viewer) cannot update an existing item.
3. A non-privileged user (viewer) cannot delete an item.
4. A non-privileged user (viewer) CAN read items — that is the
   intended behaviour and any change to it is a separate decision,
   not a security fix.
5. The wholesale ``clear-database`` truncate is admin-only.

If a future model adds a tenant column to ``CostItem``, this file
should be replaced with the same pattern as
``test_erp_chat_idor.py`` (cross-tenant 404 on read, write, delete).
