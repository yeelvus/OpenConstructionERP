"""The generated sheets PDF has to reach the documents hub. It never once did.

``_generate_pdf_in_background`` runs the DDC PDF-only export for a model that
is already converted and then writes a ``Document`` row so the sheets turn up
in the documents hub next to everything else on the project. The row was built
with a ``created_by`` keyword. ``Document`` has no such column - ``Base``
carries id, created_at and updated_at and nothing else - so SQLAlchemy's
declarative constructor answered with ``TypeError`` and the INSERT was never
attempted. Not refused: never attempted. The surrounding ``except Exception``
logged "PDF sheets -> Document linkage failed", which reads like the database
declining a row, so every install with a converter reported a database hiccup
on every export and nobody had a reason to look at the constructor.

That makes this a different animal from a write that fails under a condition.
It is a feature that has never existed on any install since the code was
written, described in the logs as an intermittent storage problem.

This test exercises the worker. It does not assert what keywords the call site
passes - a test that reads the call site would have agreed with the defect for
its whole life, because the call site was self-consistent and simply named the
wrong model's field. The row has to arrive in PostgreSQL or this test fails.

What is stubbed and why it is not the mocked-flush trap
------------------------------------------------------
Two things stand in for the outside world: ``find_converter`` and
``subprocess.run``. Both are the DDC converter binary, which is not installed
on a test machine and is not what is under test - the module deliberately does
not test DDC conversion anywhere. Everything from that point on is real: the
real ``save_geometry`` writes a real file through the real storage backend, the
real ``Document`` is constructed by the real declarative constructor, and the
real INSERT is committed to a real PostgreSQL through a session the worker
opens for itself.

Nothing about the database is simulated, which matters here more than usual.
See the trap named at the top of ``test_cad_upload_cross_link.py``: a mocked
``flush`` that merely raises does not set the session's rollback-only flag, so
a test built on one passes before and after the fix it claims to guard. The
line between a stub and a lie is whether the thing you are measuring is on the
real side of it. Here the write is.

The project is committed rather than created in a test transaction, because the
worker opens ``async_session_factory`` instead of taking the request's session
and cannot see a row nobody has committed. Without that the INSERT fails on the
foreign key, which is a failure, but not the one being measured.
