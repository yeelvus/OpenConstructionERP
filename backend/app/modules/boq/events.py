"""BOQ event handlers - activity log integration + vector indexing.

Subscribes to all ``boq.*`` events and creates activity log entries
for audit trail purposes.  Also keeps the ``oe_boq_positions`` vector
collection in sync with the underlying Position rows so semantic search
and the per-row "Similar items" panel always reflect the latest data.

This module is auto-imported by the module loader when the ``oe_boq``
module is loaded (see ``module_loader._load_module`` → ``events.py``).
