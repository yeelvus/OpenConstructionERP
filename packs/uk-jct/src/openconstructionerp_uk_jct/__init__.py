"""OpenConstructionERP UK Construction partner pack (NRM, JCT, UK statute).

This package exports a module-level ``MANIFEST`` instance of
:class:`PartnerPackManifest` referenced from ``pyproject.toml``::

    [project.entry-points."openconstructionerp.partner_packs"]
    uk-jct = "openconstructionerp_uk_jct:MANIFEST"

The OCERP core discovers this entry point at boot, validates the
manifest, and applies the partner overrides (branding, locale,
cost regions, validation rule packs, onboarding script).
