"""Every option the project create page offers must reach the registry.

``frontend/src/features/projects/CreateProjectPage.tsx`` holds two hand-written
mirrors of ``app.core.classification_registry``, and both have shipped a defect
of the same shape. The region picker writes strings the registry could not read.
The standards picker writes values the registry reads and names a country beside
each one that the registry has an opinion about. This file covers both, because
they share a file, a failure mode and a parse, and splitting them would leave
the second gate as something for somebody to write later.

**The defect this file exists to prevent.**

``classification_registry.normalise_region`` reduces a region string to an
ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code, and two separate axes hang off the answer: the
classification standard a project's section paths render against
(:func:`resolve_standard`) and the country validation rule packs a BOQ import
runs (``boq.router._build_rule_sets``). Both read the same normaliser.

The region strings it is handed come from ``project.region``, which the region
picker in ``frontend/src/features/projects/CreateProjectPage.tsx`` writes, and
so does anything else that calls the API: ``ProjectCreate.region`` is a plain
``str`` of at most 100 characters and its validator strips whitespace and
nothing else, on purpose (A-PROJ-02, so any market can be named). The picker is
therefore the population this file can enumerate, not the population that can
reach the resolver. That picker speaks
neither ISO codes nor the macro names the alias table already carried. It ships
prose and glued CamelCase: ``Russia``, ``Brazil``, ``GulfStates``. Four of its
thirty shipped options resolved. The other twenty-six normalised to ``None``,
so ``resolve_standard`` returned ``DEFAULT_CLASSIFICATION_STANDARD`` with
``source="default"`` and ``_build_rule_sets`` looked up an empty country key. A
Moscow project was classified against German cost groups and ran no GESN rules,
and nothing anywhere went red, because a fall-through still returns a plausible
standard.

**Why the population is read from the picker file rather than listed here.**

``test_every_shipped_region_option_reaches_a_calendar.py`` documents the same
shape on the schedule resolver: twenty-one of the thirty options resolved to
DEFAULT while every assertion passed, because the gate walked the resolver's own
ISO-keyed tables and the picker was never in the population at all. The
instrument and the product spoke different vocabularies and agreed with
themselves. Copying the option values into this module would rebuild exactly
that: the copy and the picker would drift, and both sides would stay internally
consistent while drifting. So the parse below reads the shipped file, and is
cross-checked two independent ways, because a parse that silently matches
nothing is a green gate over an empty population - the same failure wearing a
different hat.

**What this file asserts, and what it deliberately does not.**

It asserts that every shipped option is *classified*: it either reduces to a
country, or it is named below with a reason. It cannot assert the country is the
*right* one for a macro region covering several. Where the members disagree the
anchor is recorded in :data:`MACRO_OPTION_ANCHORS` with what it costs, and the
anchor is asserted, so a silent re-anchoring is red even though the option would
still "resolve".

**The second mirror: the standards picker.**

``STANDARD_GROUPS`` in the same file names a country beside each standard, and
the wording is hand-written because the registry has no opinion about wording.
So the country beside the name can drift from the country the registry maps, and
did: VOCI was offered as "VOCI (Austria)" while ``COUNTRY_TO_STANDARD`` has only
ever resolved it for IT. An Austrian who picked the one row carrying their own
country's name wrote the Italian standard onto their project, and an Italian
scanning the list for Italy found nothing. That was fixed by hand and checked
once by hand; this half of the file is what makes the check repeat.

The country names in those labels are read against
``i18n_foundation/seed_data/countries.json``, the product's own 198-row country
registry, rather than a name-to-code table written here. A table written here
would be a third mirror of the same data, which is the defect this file exists
to catch.

Five standards carry a display label and no country:
``gaeb``, ``omniclass``, ``onorm``, ``uniclass`` and ``uniformat``. They are
outside ``KNOWN_CLASSIFICATION_STANDARDS`` and so outside the country-mapping
assertions, which is the right scope: a standard no country reads cannot be
mis-attributed to one.

``onorm`` used to be named here as the one that "reads like an omission rather
than a choice", on the grounds that OENORM is Austria's standard while Austria
resolves to ``din276``. Measured 2026-09-07, it reads like a choice:

* The OENORM rules the product ships are B 2063, the LV position-format
  standard - ordinals ``XX.XX.XXXXA`` plus a description-length floor
  (``ONORMPositionFormat`` in ``validation/rules/__init__.py``). B 2063 is a
  tender-document structure, the Austrian counterpart of GAEB, and not a
  cost-group hierarchy. B 1801-1 is the cost-group standard and it appears
  nowhere in the tree.
* Austria already runs those rules. ``boq.router._build_rule_sets`` carries
  ``COUNTRY_RULES["AT"] = ["gaeb", "onorm"]``, keyed on the country rather than
  on the classification standard, so an Austrian BOQ is validated against
  B 2063 today without any registry entry.
* Mapping ``AT`` to ``onorm`` would change no section path. The renderer walks
  ``classification_order()`` and takes the first standard the CostItem carries
  a code for, and no shipped cost row carries an ``onorm`` key, so the answer
  would still be the ``din276`` code the DACH rows do carry. The mapping alone
  would change only what the product claims.

So ``onorm`` sits with ``gaeb``: an exchange-format vocabulary living in a
cost-breakdown registry, country-less because it is not a breakdown. Whether
Austria should get B 1801-1 cost groups is a live product question, and it
needs a code table and seeded codes rather than a line in the map.

**Would anyone know if a project fell to the default?**

No, unless they are reading logs. ``_report_default`` emits one WARNING naming
the region, deduplicated per process and capped at 512 distinct strings, and
nothing in ``app`` reads ``StandardResolution.matched`` or ``.source``. There is
no API field, no operator view and nothing a user sees, so the only signal that
a project is being classified against a fallback is a log line nobody has a
reason to open. That is why the check has to happen here: afterwards there is
nothing to notice.
