/**
 * The top-bar entry point to the module builder.
 *
 * It sits in the header rather than in the sidebar because building a module is
 * something you do *from wherever you are* - you notice the platform is missing
 * a register while you are looking at the thing that needs it. The sidebar
 * lists screens; this is an action.
 *
 * Shown to administrators only. Installing writes files onto the server and
 * loads them into the running process, which is `module_builder.install`, an
 * administrator permission. The role read here comes from the auth store and is
 * for deciding what to draw, never for access: the server enforces the
 * permission on the call itself, and a viewer who reached this some other way
 * is refused there.
 *
 * The wizard is loaded lazily. It is a large screen that most sessions never
 * open, and the header is on every page.
