"""Trigram (pg_trgm) index for fuzzy cost-item search.

Cost-item search upgraded from plain substring (ILIKE) matching to fuzzy, ranked
search using PostgreSQL trigram similarity (the pg_trgm extension). This
migration provisions the two database objects that path relies on:

    pg_trgm extension         - enables ``similarity`` / ``word_similarity`` and
                                the trigram operators used to rank results and to
                                broaden recall (typo- and word-order-tolerant
                                matching).
    ix_costs_description_trgm - a GIN trigram index on ``lower(description)`` so
                                the broadened recall and the ILIKE arms stay fast
                                on the 55k+ row multilingual catalogue.

Both steps are best-effort and fully guarded. CREATE EXTENSION needs a superuser
(the embedded cluster qualifies; a locked-down managed cluster may not), so it is
wrapped in try/except and never fails the migration - the service detects pg_trgm
at query time and falls back to ILIKE when it is absent. The index is only built
when the extension is present and uses IF NOT EXISTS plus an inspector guard, so
a re-run is a no-op.

The embedded-PostgreSQL runtime materialises the base table via ``create_all`` at
startup but does NOT run this migration, so that runtime relies on the same
query-time detection; this migration is for external-PostgreSQL deployments that
manage schema with Alembic. Additive: no existing table is touched. PostgreSQL
only, no SQLite shims.
