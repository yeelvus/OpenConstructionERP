"""Seeded register values, read out of the shapes the wide gate cannot see.

``test_demo_seed_speaks_module_vocabularies.py`` asks the same question across
every module, and its answer is trustworthy for the shape it reads: a dict
literal whose keys name schema fields. Two shapes fall outside it, and a tender
package status seeded "open" survived in both at once.

The first is the tuple. ``tendering/seed.py`` writes its packages as
``(suffix, trade, status, deadline, budget)``, and a tuple has no keys, so
there is nothing for the wide gate to attribute. Its own docstring names this
gap: the safety defect it misses is a tuple pool for the same reason.

The second is the directory. That gate globs ``demo_*.py`` beside
``demo_projects.py`` and ``modules/*/seed.py``. ``core/demo_packs/`` is a
subdirectory of neither, so the twenty-odd project packs, which carry most of
the seeded records a reader ever sees, are not read at all.

There is a third reason a value survives, and it is invisible from outside
because the record looks like exactly the shape the wide gate reads. The punch
items in ``demo_projects.py`` ARE dict literals, they ARE read, and they still
pass. Measured rather than assumed: the attribution was instrumented on 18.08
and those records land on ``PunchItemResponse``, which carries no pattern,
because the response schema is the one that also has ``trade``, ``location_x``
and ``resolution_notes`` and therefore covers the record best. A vocabulary
lives on Create and Update; attributing by key coverage steers towards
Response, which is where a seeded row's extra fields are.

So this file is the narrow and deep half of that division of labour, for the
registers where the miss reached a screenshot. It reads the vocabulary out of
the schema rather than restating it, so widening the product widens the test
with it and a copy of the word list cannot drift from the real one.
