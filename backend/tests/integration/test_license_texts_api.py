"""The licence endpoints as the real application mounts them.

``tests/unit/test_license_texts_route.py`` mounts the router on a bare app and
covers its behaviour. That leaves one thing unproven and it is the one that
makes the difference between a feature and a file: whether ``create_app``
actually includes the router. A route that exists and is not mounted looks
exactly like a route that was never written, from the only place a user
stands.

No lifespan is entered. These endpoints read files and touch no database, so
starting one would buy nothing and cost a schema creation over 190 modules.
