// Case: "Build an all-in labour rate with the Canadian burden" (CA).
//
// The country child of the universal all-in-rate case. The objection is "I know
// my rate, I have used it for fifteen years", and the case does not say the rate
// is wrong. It says the rate is a stack of separately sourced contributions,
// that the stack is provincial rather than national, and that when it moves the
// estimator should be able to name which line moved and when.
//
// No contribution percentage appears anywhere in this file on purpose: the
// components are named, and the rates belong to the bodies that administer them
// and to the user's own basis of estimate. Content strings are key plus inline
// English default and live only here.

    "An all-in rate is not one number. It is a base wage carrying a stack of separately sourced contributions, most of which moved at some point without telling anybody, and the reason to build it as a stack is not that your number is wrong. It is that when the number changes you should be able to say which line moved and when, and that is a property of how the rate was assembled rather than of how carefully it was checked. The stack is also provincial rather than national: the pension contribution, the employment insurance multiple paid by the employer, vacation and statutory holiday pay, the workers compensation rate for the classification unit the trade falls in and the benefit contributions are administered by different bodies at different rates in different provinces. Quebec is not a fourth province in this, it is a different stack, with its own pension plan and a separate parental insurance premium standing beside a reduced employment insurance rate.",
