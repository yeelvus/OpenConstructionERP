"""Locale umlaut guard: block a word from being spelled two ways in one file.

German writes an umlaut either as the letter itself or, where the letter is
unavailable, as the ASCII digraph that stands in for it: `ue` for u-umlaut,
`oe`, `ae`, and `ss` for the sz-ligature. Both spellings are readable, so a
locale file can drift into carrying both and nothing complains: `fuer` sat in
`de.ts` four times beside 1761 spellings of the same word with the umlaut.

The damaging half is what happens when someone notices and fixes it with a
find/replace. The digraph is not a marker, it is two ordinary letters, and it
occurs inside perfectly normal German words that were never folded at all -
Steuer, Quelle, neue, bauen, zuerst, aktuell, manuell, Mauerwerk, Feuer,
dauerhaft, genau, grau, trauen, Konto+einstellungen. A mechanical pass eats
those too and leaves behind non-words: Steur, Qulle, neu, baun, zurst, aktull
(each with an umlaut where the vowels were). 91 such occurrences shipped in
the German UI, and 35 more spellings of the fold kind sat beside them.

Invisible to every other gate, and to every mechanical reviewer: the key is
present, the placeholder count is unchanged, the file parses, `npm run build`
is green, and locale coverage checks count a string that is there. Only a
German reader looking at the rendered page sees that the word is not a word.

The invariant here is language-neutral and needs no dictionary: within a
single locale file, a word must not appear both with an umlaut and in its
folded spelling. Whichever side is wrong, the file disagrees with itself, and
the disagreement is what a human has to settle. Measured across all 43 locale
files plus the backend validation messages when this was written, it fired on
German alone, so it is not a source of routine noise.

Diaeresis and vowel-cluster languages are unaffected by construction: Dutch
`coordinatie` and `geupload` (with diaeresis), Finnish `tekoaly`, Swedish
`poang`, Estonian `igauks` and Turkish `masaustu` never carry the folded twin
in the same file, so the pair never forms.

`_ALLOWED_PAIRS` holds spellings that differ by a fold and are genuinely two
different words, or two accepted orthographies. Each needs a written reason.
It must never be used to silence a hit that is simply inconvenient.

Usage:
    python scripts/check_locale_umlaut_folding.py

Exit code 0 means clean (no file disagrees with itself; any allowed pair is
listed by name). Exit code 1 means a word is spelled two ways and the output
names every file, both spellings and how often each occurs.
