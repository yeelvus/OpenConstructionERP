// Case: "Compare the tender bill against the settlement" (CN).
//
// The completion settlement is audited line against line, and the mechanical
// half of that audit is finding every line that moved between the bill that was
// awarded and the bill that was submitted for settlement. That half is what the
// line-by-line comparison does, and it does it well: added, removed, quantity
// changed, rate changed, unchanged, with old and new figures side by side and a
// difference rebased into one currency.
//
// The half a machine cannot do is say WHY a line moved. Nothing in the product
// joins a change order to the bill line it moved, so the case walks the
// reviewer through pairing the movements against the change order register
// themselves, and ends by agreeing the list in writing rather than by exporting
// it. Content strings are key plus inline English default and live only here.

    "A settlement review is two jobs wearing one name. The first is finding the movements, which is mechanical, enormous on a bill of several hundred items, and the thing a reviewer usually does by eye over two evenings with a ruler. The second is deciding whether each movement was authorised, which is judgement and cannot be automated. This case does the first job in one pass and then hands you the second with the evidence in front of you. It matters that the comparison matches on the item code where a line carries one: a coded bill survives insertion and renumbering between award and settlement, while an uncoded bill matches on position number alone and a renumbered settlement reads as a wall of removals and additions instead of as a comparison.",
