"""An AIA payment application prints figures in the contract's own units.

The G702 face and the G703 continuation sheet were both formatted by one
helper, and that helper was handed the currency code, printed the code next to
the figure on the face, and still quantised to a ``Decimal("0.01")`` literal.

Eligibility for this form is gated on the project's country, US, CA or AU, and
not on the contract's currency, which is a free ISO code the contract carries.
So the reachable case is a US project running a contract denominated in
something other than dollars, which is narrower than a tender letter but is not
closed, and the document goes to an owner and an architect who certify the
figure on it.

The continuation sheet is the half that could have been missed. Its columns are
too narrow to repeat the code on every row, so it called the helper with no
currency at all, and a repair that only fixed the code-carrying calls would
have left the sheet quoting cents underneath a face quoting whole units. Both
are asserted here, from one rendered document, so they cannot drift apart.
