"""Certified payroll business logic.

The one idea worth stating before the code: a draft week owns no rows. Its lines
are derived from ``oe_payroll`` every time they are asked for, so there is never
a second live copy of the same hours drifting away from the first. Certifying
freezes that derivation into :class:`CertifiedPayrollLine` and stamps the
signature, and from then on the week reads back its own frozen rows and never
recomputes them.

Both paths produce the same dict shape, so the validation rules, the form
serialiser and the API response do not know or care which they were handed.
