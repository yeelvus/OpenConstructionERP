"""A pack carries its version twice and nothing kept the two in step.

``pyproject.toml`` holds the version the wheel is built and published under.
``manifest.py`` holds ``pack_version``, which is what the application reports
in the pack list, in the install audit record and over the API. They are two
literals for one fact, and every pack in the tree had them equal by convention
alone.

Convention held until it did not: raising the uk-jct manifest to 0.3.0 for a
substantial rewrite left the wheel at 0.2.0, so an installed pack would have
reported a version its own distribution never carried. That is the kind of
drift nobody notices from the inside, because both numbers look plausible on
their own and neither file mentions the other.

Pure filesystem work, no database and no imports from ``app``, so it cannot be
skipped by a database marker.
