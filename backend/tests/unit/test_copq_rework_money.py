"""Guard: no bare numeric literal may act as money inside the COPQ maths.

The cost of poor quality used to be part guess. ``compute_copq`` multiplied
the open punch count by a module constant of ``Decimal("250.00")`` in no
declared currency, so the headline figure was a number nobody had recorded
and nobody could denominate. The rework term now comes from
``punchlist.PunchItem.rework_cost``, which is money a human actually entered
alongside the currency they entered it in.

This file is the ratchet that keeps it that way. It reads the source with
``ast`` and never imports the application, so it holds no database opinion
and cannot be skipped out from under a green summary by a missing
``OE_TEST_DB``. It prints its census: which functions it found, how many
nodes it walked, and every literal it saw with the verdict on each.

Two failure modes are covered, because the original defect used the second:

* a numeric literal written directly into the computation, and
* a module-level constant holding one, referenced by name from inside it -
  which a scan of the function bodies alone would walk straight past.
