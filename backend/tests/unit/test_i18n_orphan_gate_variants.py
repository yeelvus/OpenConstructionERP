"""A regional variant is covered by its base language, not by English.

Four locale files here carry only the words that differ from their base:
es-MX, es-CL and es-CO resolve through es, pt-BR through pt. en-US joined
them and carries 1499 keys against English's 33771, which is the whole point
of an overlay. The orphan guard had no concept of any of this and counted
every key a variant does not declare as a hole, so one deliberate overlay
produced 25280 errors and the cheapest way to make them stop would have been
to paste a full copy of English into en-US.ts.

The distinction the guard has to draw: resolving into the base language is
the designed behaviour and the reader gets their own language, while
resolving past the base into English is exactly the silent defect the guard
was written for.
