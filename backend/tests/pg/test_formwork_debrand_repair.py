"""The boot-path repair for trademarked formwork catalogue rows.

Runs against a real PostgreSQL cluster because the thing under test is a data rewrite and a
duplicate guard that compares a nullable ``tenant_id``, and both of those are exactly what an
in-memory stand-in gets wrong.

Two-sided on purpose. A test that only proves a branded catalogue is repaired has tested the
half that was never in doubt; the half that matters is that a catalogue which is already
correct comes back byte-identical, and that is asserted by comparing the rows themselves
rather than by the repair merely not raising.
