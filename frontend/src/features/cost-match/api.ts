/**
 * API helpers for the Cost Match module.
 *
 * Backed by /api/v1/cost-match/ — see
 * backend/app/modules/cost_match/router.py
 *
 * Money, quantities and confidence arrive as plain-decimal **strings**. The
 * backend is explicit about why (schemas.py): a unit rate crossing the wire as
 * a JSON number loses precision in every JavaScript client, and a confidence
 * that becomes a float turns a "0.75" boundary into 0.7499999999999999 in a
 * client-side comparison. They stay strings here and are parsed only where one
 * is compared, in costMatchStatus.ts.
 *
 * Enum-shaped response fields are typed `string`, not a union. The backend
 * declares them as bare `str` so a reader never crashes on a value a later
 * version writes; the unions below type what may be *sent*. Narrowing an
 * arriving value is `resultTier` / `decisionStateOf`'s job.
 *
 * The last two calls read the *costs* module rather than this one. They are
 * here rather than imported from `features/costs` because an override target
 * has to be scoped to the exact base the run is pinned to — cost_source plus
 * region plus catalog_id — and `GET /v1/costs/` is the only endpoint that
 * accepts all three together.
