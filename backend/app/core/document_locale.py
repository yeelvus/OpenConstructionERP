"""Locale resolution for generated documents.

A document is not an API response. The API can answer in any of the
locales listed in :data:`app.core.i18n.SUPPORTED_LOCALES`, because those
strings live in locale files that are complete by construction. A PDF is
rendered from a string catalogue that ships inside its own module and
covers far fewer languages. The two numbers are different, and the gap
between them is where a reader ends up holding an English invoice after
setting the interface to their own language.

This module holds the resolution the document renderers share, so the
rule lives in one place instead of being copied per module:

  1. ``?locale=de`` query parameter (region stripped) when the catalogue
     has it.
  2. The first ``Accept-Language`` tag, in header order, whose primary
     subtag the catalogue has. Quality weights are ignored on purpose -
     a single best match is enough, and header order is the browser's
     preference order in practice.
  3. The catalogue's default language.

**Primary subtags only.** Every caller reduces ``fr-CA`` to ``fr`` before
matching, so a document catalogue cannot today distinguish Canadian from
European French, nor Brazilian from European Portuguese, however many
strings it holds. Regional document variants are a schema change here and
in every catalogue, not a translation job.

**Falling back is not free.** :func:`resolve_document_locale` returning
the default means the reader asked for something we could not render.
Callers serving that document MUST declare the language they actually
produced in a ``Content-Language`` response header, so the degradation is
visible to the client instead of being hidden behind a request-derived
header that names a language the body is not written in.
