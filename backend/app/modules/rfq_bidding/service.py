"""RFQ Bidding service - business logic for RFQ and bid management.

Stateless service layer. It holds three things beyond plain CRUD:

* the lifecycle gates, which decide when a quote may still arrive and who may
  award one;
* the standing of each quote, which decides whether it may be ranked at all -
  a quote that arrived late is recorded and kept out of the ranking until the
  buyer admits it on the record, rather than refused and lost;
* the award itself, which is only allowed to take a quote the comparison could
  actually put on the RFQ's basis, and which writes down the ranked table it
  was taken from.

The arithmetic of putting quotes on one basis lives in
:mod:`app.modules.rfq_bidding.comparison` and is pure; this layer supplies it
with data and stores what it returns.
