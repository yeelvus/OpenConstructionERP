"""The CWICR v3 store resolves to one place, and writes never outrun reads.

Four call sites used to answer "where is the CWICR store" and no two were
written from the same rule. ``qdrant_adapter._get_client`` consulted
``cwicr_qdrant_url`` alone and otherwise opened an embedded store;
``qdrant_snapshot_loader`` consulted it strictly in one function and
leniently in another; the router helper added ``or qdrant_url``. Because
``qdrant_url`` carries a non-None default and ``cwicr_qdrant_url`` carries
none, the lenient resolutions could never fall through and the strict one
always did. On a default install the snapshot therefore restored to
``http://localhost:6333`` while the ranker opened
``~/.openestimator/qdrant_cwicr``, and every surface reported success.

The invariant these tests hold is not "the four agree today". It is that a
write target is never a server the reader does not open: either the two
resolve to the same place, or the write is refused with a message an
operator can act on.

Every case builds ``Settings(_env_file=None, ...)``. Without that, pydantic
loads ``backend/.env``, and on a developer machine that file sets
``CWICR_QDRANT_URL`` - which silently supplies the missing value to every
case and makes the whole file pass by describing the machine rather than
the product.

Two assertions here were never proved red, and the next reader should not
assume otherwise just because the rest of the file was. Both are in the
``is_server`` branch of the cross-module invariant below: ``mismatch is
None`` and ``write_target == read_target.location``. Both injections
restored the old lenient resolution, which is a failure of the embedded
branch, so the configured-server cases stayed green throughout. They pin the
positive path - that a correctly configured server is NOT refused - and a
regression that breaks them would be a refusal storm rather than a silent
divergence, which is loud enough to find without a red run behind it.
