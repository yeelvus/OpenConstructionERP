"""The i18n keys an action sends to the dock, with their English text.

Every key the backend puts on a proposal - its title, field labels, enum
option labels, notes, undo hints and error messages - is declared here once,
with the English the dock falls back to. The dock translates by key; the
English is only the fallback, so a key missing from a locale still reads.
``all_keys()`` is what the i18n phase adds to ``en.ts``, and a unit test holds
every key an action can emit to this table.
