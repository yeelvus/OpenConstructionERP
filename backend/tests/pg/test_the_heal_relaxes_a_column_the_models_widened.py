"""A revision that widens a column never ran, so the heal has to do it.

What runs on upgrade for most installs is ``postgres_auto_migrate``, not the
migration chain. Until now it only ever added things, so a revision whose whole
content was ``ALTER COLUMN ... DROP NOT NULL`` had no effect on any of those
installs. The old constraint survived, the models went on declaring the value
optional, and the first ordinary write that left it empty raised
NotNullViolation from inside a request that had already written its row.

That is not hypothetical. It shipped: ``oe_supplier_catalogs_stock_movement``
and ``oe_supplier_catalogs_stock_balance`` both carry a cost column the models
made optional, and on an upgraded database both were still NOT NULL.

These drive the real heal against a metadata built here rather than against
``Base``. Both sides of the comparison then belong to the test, so the aged
shape is exact, the count is exact, and nothing in the shared cluster is
disturbed. The end-to-end proof on a genuinely aged database is the upgrade
lane; what is pinned here is the mechanism and, in particular, that it refuses
the one column PostgreSQL would reject it on.
