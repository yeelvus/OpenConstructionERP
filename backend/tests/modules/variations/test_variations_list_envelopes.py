"""The variations list routes describe how much of themselves they return.

All seven registers in this module used to answer with a bare
``list[XResponse]``. Each one already received a total from
``<repo>.list_for_project`` and threw it away with ``rows, _ = ...``, so a
project past its fiftieth notice served fifty rows and no way to tell.

Two tests, because there are two different ways to regress this:

#. :func:`test_every_list_route_answers_with_an_envelope` walks the router's
   registered routes. It covers all seven paths including
   ``site-measurements`` and ``disruption-claims``, which no frontend reads
   yet and which the envelope-consumer guard therefore cannot watch. A route
   quietly reverted to ``list[...]`` fails here.

#. :func:`test_the_total_is_the_registers_size_not_the_pages` drives one route
   with a stub repository that returns two rows and a total of 137. That is
   the assertion the shape test cannot make: a route could carry an envelope
   and still fill ``total`` with ``len(rows)``, which reads as an honest page
   and is the exact lie this programme exists to remove.

No database: the repository and the project-scope guard are both stubbed.
