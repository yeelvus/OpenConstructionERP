"""Find the country-shaped registries in the tree, without being told where they are.

:mod:`app.core.country_coverage` asks one question of every country-shaped
registry in the product. Its denominator used to be the set of probes somebody
had already written, which makes the coverage figure a measurement of the
instrument rather than of the product: a registry nobody wrote a probe for is
reported neither as covered nor as missing, and the percentage stays flattering
because the thing it does not know about is not in the divisor either.

This module supplies the divisor by walking the code. Adding a registry to the
tree moves the number here on its own, with nobody editing a list.

Why the value shape and never the field name
--------------------------------------------

A registry is recognised by the shape of what is written in it - a two-letter
uppercase string - and never by the name of the field holding it. That is not a
stylistic preference. The field name axis in this tree is at least six wide:
``country_code``, ``country_iso``, ``iso_code``, ``country``, ``jurisdiction``
and ``code`` are all in use. A first attempt at this inventory keyed on
``country_code`` and read ``i18n_foundation/seed_data/countries.json`` - 198
rows, the largest country registry in the product - as **zero countries**,
because that file spells the field ``iso_code``; the same pass missed
``CWICR_V3_CATALOGUES`` entirely, because that one spells it ``country_iso``. A
scope defined by the argument a probe happens to look for is blind to the same
argument spelled another way, so this pass does not look for a name at all.

Why there is no ISO filter, and why the denominator is inexact
--------------------------------------------------------------

The obvious sharpening is to keep only tokens that are real countries, taking
the notion of "country" from the product's own list rather than from a list
written here. It was tried and measured, and it fails in both directions.

It does remove real noise: ``eac.evm.METRIC_GLOSSARY`` (AC/CV/EV/PV/SV, earned
value metrics), ``documents.intl._DECIMAL_UNITS`` (EB/GB/MB/PB/TB, byte units)
and ``schedule_advanced.cpm.DEP_TYPE_NAMES`` (FF/FS/SF/SS, dependency types)
all fall below the threshold once non-countries are dropped.

But it also removes a registry that is real, and the flagship one:
``schedule.service.WORK_CALENDARS`` has only three country-shaped keys among
its thirteen - RU, UK and US, the rest being DACH, GULF, CANADA and FRANCE -
and "UK" is not a country code, so an ISO filter leaves two and the table falls
below the threshold. The filter loses the very registry the schedule probe
exists to read.

And it still keeps noise, because the collisions are irreducible. ``GB`` is
Great Britain and a gigabyte. ``IN`` is India and an inch. ``SA`` is Saudi
Arabia and Saturday. ``meetings.service._WEEKDAY_MAP`` keeps FR, SA and TH
through any country filter, and ``bim_hub.ifc_processor._CONVERSION_BASED_FACTORS``
keeps HR, IN and LB.

Measured against the product's own shipped list of 198 codes, 12 of the 72
registries this pass finds are under half ISO 3166, and one of them is why
``iso_hits`` exists at all. ``us_pack.config.PACK_CONFIG`` carries FL, NY, TX
and WA beside its country list, so the shape rule reads six country-shaped
tokens where the product means two. A probe already covers that registry, so it
never reaches the unprobed list, and before the annotation nothing anywhere on
the page could have told a reader that four of the six were states. That is
this census's own defect one level in: not a country nobody answered for, but a
token counted as a country by a rule that cannot see what it is.

The annotation describes and never subtracts. A near miss stays in the divisor,
because the moment a classification can remove a registry from the count, the
divisor is a hand-kept list of what somebody thought was interesting again, and
that is the thing this module was written to replace.

So no rule over the shape of the token, and no rule derived from the product's
own data, separates a country from a weekday, a byte unit or an imperial unit.
A filter tight enough to drop the weekday map also drops the work calendars.
**This pass therefore favours recall and states its noise rather than
suppressing it.** A false positive costs one line on a page a human reads; a
false negative is a registry that goes unmeasured, which is the whole defect
this file exists to close. There is deliberately no suppression list: a list of
things to ignore is the hand-maintained denominator coming back through the
side door, and the way to retire a candidate is to write a probe that records
what it actually is, next to the evidence.

What this pass cannot see
-------------------------

Stated here so a reader does not mistake the inventory for the world:

* **A registry with fewer than three country codes.** ``uk_pack``'s config
  declares one country and is invisible. Three is the lowest threshold that
  does not admit every two-letter enum in the tree, and it is what keeps
  ``WORK_CALENDARS`` (exactly three) in.
* **A population assembled at import time.** ``contracts.compliance_packs.PACK_BY_COUNTRY``
  reads as two countries here and six when imported, because four of its keys
  come from a comprehension over another table. A structural parse cannot run a
  comprehension, which is why the coverage probes read the live object wherever
  they can and say which way they read it.
* **A per-record column.** ``Contact.country_code`` is a field on a row a user
  typed, not a registry of per-country product behaviour, and models are not
  walked.
