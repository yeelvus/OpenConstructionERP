"""The session list says which session you are reading it from.

Revocation is only usable if the person can tell the sessions apart. Without
this flag the list is five rows of timestamps, and the one action people
actually want - end everything except the device in my hand - requires knowing
which row is the device in your hand. Getting that wrong is not a cosmetic
error: it signs you out of the session you are working in and leaves the one
you were worried about alive.

Kept in its own file rather than beside the revocation tests because it
measures a different claim. Those ask whether a session can be ended; this asks
whether the list is legible enough to choose the right one. The flag is also
the only field in the response computed from the REQUEST rather than read from
the row, so it is the only one that can be right for one caller and wrong for
another - and a test that logs in once cannot see that at all.
