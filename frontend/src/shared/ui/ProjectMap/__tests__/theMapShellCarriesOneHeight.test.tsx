// The map shell must carry exactly one height utility.
//
// WHY THIS SHAPE. The defect this guards was invisible to every check we
// had, including the eye. ProjectMap emitted its own height and then
// appended the caller's ``className`` after it, so the project detail page
// went out as ``... h-full h-[32rem]``. Both names survive into the emitted
// stylesheet, and the one Tailwind wrote LAST there decides, whatever order
// they sit in on the element. ``.h-full`` lands after ``.h-[32rem]``, so the
// page asked for 32rem and got ``h-full`` against an auto-height grid
// parent. That computes to 2px, and the shell's own ``overflow-hidden``
// cropped a live 300px map canvas down to a hairline.
//
// Everything about that state looks healthy. The map mounted, MapLibre
// initialised, the canvas painted, attribution was correct, no request
// failed and no console error appeared. Two code comments asserted the
// opposite of the truth and are why it survived a long time: one claimed a
// custom className "still wins because tailwind's JIT utilities cascade
// after the default class", and the other said the fixed height was there
// "so it doesn't collapse to zero" while being defeated by the first.
//
// So this file asserts the INVARIANT on the rendered class list rather than
// the helper that currently implements it. A unit test on ``hasOwnHeight``
// would stay green if somebody changed how the shell composes its classes,
// which is exactly the edit that would put the bug back. The invariant is
// "never two heights on one element", and it is checked by counting, so it
// fails in both directions: adding a second height fails it, and dropping
// the height entirely fails it too.
//
// Run: npx vitest run src/shared/ui/ProjectMap/__tests__/theMapShellCarriesOneHeight.test.tsx

// and it leaves the card on its fallback image, which is the state whose

 * Unprefixed only. ``md:h-96`` sets a height above its breakpoint and not
 * below one, so it neither conflicts with a default nor replaces it, and
 * counting it would make the invariant lie about a class list that is fine.
 * ``min-h-`` and ``max-h-`` bound a height rather than setting one and are
 * not counted either, which is what lets the weather layout pair ``h-full``
 * with ``min-h-[20rem]`` legitimately.
