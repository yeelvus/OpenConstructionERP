"""i18n computed-key guard: the t() call sites whose key is not a literal.

check_i18n_orphan_keys.py closes the hole where `t('key', {defaultValue})`
names a key no locale file can answer. Its call-site regex requires a quoted
string for the key, and that is not a limitation of its implementation but
the boundary of what it can resolve. Every call site that builds its key at
runtime sits outside it:

    t(`price_breakdown.kind.${c.kind}`, { defaultValue: c.kind })
    t(item.labelKey, { defaultValue: item.defaultLabel })

Both render the English defaultValue in all 40 languages when the key is
missing. That is the same silent failure the orphan guard exists to stop,
arriving through a door it cannot watch. nav.credentials reached production
through the second shape: a sidebar entry whose key existed in no locale
file, invisible to the orphan scan and to the locale-gap scan alike, reading
correct English to every reviewer who opened the page.

This guard started by asking only about en.ts, on the reasoning that "is this
key answered by every locale" belonged to the orphan guard and a second script
answering the same question would give two baselines for one fact. That split
held only while the keys were unresolvable. A key absent from en.ts is still
the unambiguous case, it exists nowhere and the English default is all anyone
will ever see, but wherever this script recovers a CONCRETE key the orphan
guard cannot reach, the locale question is this script's to ask too, because
no other script can reach that key either. The member check below already
works this way, and so does the `<x>Default` pair class. There is one baseline
per question, never two baselines for one fact.

Five shapes, and the difference between them is the whole design.

  * Template literal, static head. `price_breakdown.kind.${kind}` cannot be
    resolved to its members without knowing the union, and c.kind arrives
    from the wire as a string, so no amount of cleverness recovers them. But
    "does en.ts hold ANY key beginning with `price_breakdown.kind.`" is
    decidable without knowing a single member, and an empty answer proves
    the entire family is unanswerable. That is the first check.

    It used to stop there, on the claim that a populated prefix might still
    be missing individual members and this guard could say nothing about
    those. That claim was one step short of true. Once en.ts answers a
    prefix, its members are no longer hypothetical: they are literal
    dictionary entries sitting in the file this script has already parsed.
    schedule_advanced.rnc.manpower is exactly as literal as any key the
    orphan guard resolves from a call site, and asking whether every OTHER
    locale carries it is the same question the orphan guard already knows
    how to ask, just fed a key list gathered from en.ts instead of from a
    quoted call site. So the second check enumerates the concrete members of
    every prefix en.ts answers, and asks each of the other locales for each
    of them, exactly as the orphan guard would. A family being "answered"
    used to mean en.ts alone; it now means every locale that has to.
    schedule_advanced.rnc reached 38 of 38 locales that need their own copy
    only because someone measured it by hand outside this script - this
    check exists so the next family like it does not need a human to notice.

  * Literal key paired with a default in a table. `{ labelKey: 'nav.x',
    defaultLabel: 'X' }` is fully resolvable even though the call site that
    consumes it is not, because the key is right there as a literal. This is
    the nav.credentials shape and it is checked exactly. The same prop is
    written under six names in this tree (defaultLabel, defaultName,
    defaultDesc, defaultText, defaultTitle, defaultHelp) and all six pair,
    because a guard keyed to one of them would report the class clean while
    its siblings went unread.

  * Literal key paired with its English in a `<x>Default` field. `{ titleKey:
    'guide.dashboard.title', titleDefault: 'Dashboard' }` is the same class as
    the one above and was in none of this script's buckets, not even the NOT
    CHECKED census below, because the pairing anchored on the PREFIX spelling
    `default` plus a capital and this shape writes the suffix. `titleDefault`
    is not `defaultTitle`, and the sibling rule in the next bullet looks for a
    bare `title` field, which a guide does not have either. So 5050 pairs, the
    whole `guide.*` namespace among them, went unread while the script printed
    a clean exit and a census that did not mention them.

    It is the nav.credentials failure a second time. Every one of the 104
    *Guide.ts files is written this way, the call site in
    shared/ui/ModuleGuide.tsx is `t(content.titleKey, { defaultValue:
    content.titleDefault })`, and none of those keys are in en.ts, so the
    English default is what every reader in every language gets. The key is a
    literal where the table declares it, which is why this is decidable at all.

    Two questions are asked of it, and they are kept apart because the answers
    are nothing alike. Is the key in en.ts: 1520 are not, every one of them a
    guide, recorded per family in i18n_suffix_pair_baseline.json as a count
    matched exactly, so it fails when the debt grows and equally when it
    shrinks without the entry coming down with it, since a count left high is
    slack the next addition spends unseen. Can every locale answer the ones
    en.ts DOES hold: all 736 can, so that half gets no baseline and the next
    break of it fails on arrival rather than being absorbed by a list.

    The `cases.<slug>.*` keys are excluded from the en.ts question only, on the
    reason the next bullet already gives: they keep their English in the case
    data file deliberately, so asking en.ts about them is the wrong question,
    and the 2793 of them would have buried the 1520 real findings. They are
    counted and named in the census rather than dropped.

  * Literal key paired with its English in a SIBLING field. `{ moduleLabel:
    'Payment Clock', moduleLabelKey: 'nav.payment_clock' }` looks like the
    class above and is not reachable by it, because the pair is anchored on
    the English field and this one is not named default-anything. Adding a
    seventh name would not fix it either: the same widening pulls in the
    `cases.<slug>.*` content keys, and those keep their English in the data
    file on purpose and are deliberately absent from en.ts, so the one
    question this script asks would be the wrong question to ask about them.
    They are counted and named below, and the module chips among them are
    checked by check_case_module_chip_locales.py, which asks locale coverage
    instead. Before that script existed this shape was in no scan at all and
    three chip keys reached 31 locales in English.

  * Everything else. A bare variable (`t(job.stage, {defaultValue})`), a
    template whose interpolation comes first and leaves no prefix. These
    cannot be resolved at all. They are counted, named, and printed under a
    heading that says they were not checked. A gate that drops what it
    cannot resolve is worse than no gate, because the clean exit reads as
    coverage over ground nobody looked at.

Known debt lives in the baseline file and may only shrink. The prop-shaped
class had no findings when this was written, so it contributes nothing to the
baseline and any new break of that shape fails on arrival.

The baseline arrived at 118 entries. It passed through 188 while the families
were being worked, but that intermediate never existed on main, so the seventy
reasons taken off it are not recoverable from history and would have to be
re-derived from the call sites. Each remaining entry carries its reason because
a bare list of prefixes decays into a list nobody can audit: the reason is the
only thing that tells a later reader whether a family may come off.

The member-completeness check has its own baseline, i18n_computed_member_
baseline.json, and it is a worklist rather than an allowlist for a reason a
plain list of prefixes would not give it. Each entry names the prefix, the
member count and the locale coverage it was frozen at, for example
`"schedule_advanced.rnc.": {"members": 9, "locales_ok": 38, "locales_total":
43, "missing": {"uz": [...]}}`. A prefix recorded only by name tells a later
reader nothing about whether the debt is one locale short of done or has
barely started; the count is what turns the entry into a thing someone can
work down instead of a permanent excuse. The `missing` map is the same shape
i18n_orphan_baseline.json already uses for literal keys, key by key rather
than a plain locale count, because a count cannot tell a repaired locale from
a newly broken one and this baseline may only shrink in the same sense the
orphan baseline does: fewer locales missing each member, never more.

This script, that baseline and the repo-hygiene job that runs it are one change
and cannot be split into three. The job names this file by path, and both this
file and the baseline arrived untracked, so any commit carrying the workflow
without them is red the moment it lands.

One thing to know before correcting English anywhere this guard points. Once a
family has members in en.ts, i18next never reaches its defaultValue, so the
label table at the call site stops being what anyone reads and becomes the
fallback for values outside the declared set. Fixing wording in that table alone
therefore changes the code and not the screen, which is exactly what happened to
the ROM reconciliation band: the table was corrected, the keys had landed hours
earlier, and the panel went on showing the older wording. Worse, the test over
that panel mocks react-i18next, so t() hands back the defaultValue and the
assertions are about the table. It was green throughout. A test written that way
proves the fallback correct and says nothing at all about what renders, so the
place to check a string this guard has landed is en.ts.

Parser desync is a failure, not a pass, on the same reasoning as the sibling
guards: en.ts parsing to zero keys, or a source tree yielding no call sites,
exits 2 rather than reporting a clean scan of nothing.

The member-completeness check shares one more piece of machinery with the
orphan guard: a locale outside SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES is not enforced the same
way a listed one is. frontend/src/app/i18n.ts decides which languages a real
reader can pick, and this check reads how much of an unlisted locale's file
still matches English word for word (identical_fraction, against
IN_PROGRESS_IDENTICAL_FRACTION) to tell a file mid-translation from one that
reads finished but was never listed. A locale in SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES gets no
exception regardless: every member it is missing is a hard error. See
check_i18n_orphan_keys.py, which carries the fuller reasoning and the
measurement this threshold was set from; the two guards duplicate the
mechanism rather than share it, on the same one-script-per-concern grounds
they already duplicate _options_body and _KEY_LINE.
