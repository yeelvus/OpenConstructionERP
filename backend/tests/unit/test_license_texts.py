"""The bundled licence texts, and the two layouts they have to be found in.

``app/core/licenses`` reaches every published artefact and, until the route
these tests cover, nothing in the backend could read it. What is checked here
is the locating, because that is the part with a branch no checkout exercises:
in a source tree the first candidate always answers, so a green run from the
repo says nothing at all about the frozen desktop build, which is the only
deployment the endpoint exists for.

None of this is a test of a real frozen bundle. It cannot be run from here.
What it does instead is hold the two halves of the frozen claim against each
other: the destination this module hardcodes, and the destination
``desktop/pyinstaller.spec`` actually ships to.
