 * A record of its own, apart from the workspace brand (/api/v1/branding/). The

 * callers; the letterhead carries a registered address and tax identifiers, so
 * the server keeps it behind sign-in. Reading needs any signed-in user,
 * writing needs admin.
 *
 * Every field is free text on purpose: address order and the identifiers a
 * firm must print differ by country, so the firm writes the lines exactly as
 * they appear on its paper and the PDF prints them verbatim.
