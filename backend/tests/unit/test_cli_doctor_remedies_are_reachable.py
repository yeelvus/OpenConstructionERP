"""A remedy the reader cannot carry out is worse than no remedy at all.

Every hint in the doctor was written for a pip install, which is where most of
them are read. The desktop build has no pip in it: ``sys.executable`` is the
app binary, so "pip install --force-reinstall openconstructionerp" cannot be
run there at all. An operator who follows it learns only that the tool which
found the fault also cannot fix it, and the next report they read gets less
trust than it deserves.

The sweep below is deliberately over the whole doctor rather than over the
lines known to be wrong today. Only one of them can reach a desktop reader as
things stand, because everything else the doctor names is in
``requirements-desktop.lock`` and those branches report ok with the hint never
rendered. That is a fact about today's lock, not about this code: a dependency
leaving the lock arms another line silently, with nothing to catch it.
