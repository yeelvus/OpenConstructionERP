"""The UK cost-plan and statutory rules.

Two rule sets, and the split between them is the point. ``nrm`` is a method of
measurement and travels wherever the method is used, so an Australian project
measured to NRM gets those four rules and none of the British statute. The
``uk_statutory`` set is the law of one country, is switched on by the UK pack,
and asks only what an estimate records about itself.

Every statutory rule here checks that something is stated rather than what it
says, with one exception. The higher-risk building test is statute and is
checkable, so it is checked: the estimate's own storeys, height and dwelling
count either produce the answer it declared or they do not.
