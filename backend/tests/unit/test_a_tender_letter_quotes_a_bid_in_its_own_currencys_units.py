"""A tender letter quotes an amount with the digits its currency has.

The award letter, the rejection notice and the award record all print money
through one renderer, ``pdf_documents._fmt_money``. It was handed the currency
code, printed that code next to the figure, and still quantised to a
``Decimal("0.01")`` literal, so a tender settled in forint went out quoting
fillér that left circulation in 1999 with the letters HUF beside them, and one
settled in Kuwaiti dinar went out a fils short of the bid it was quoting.

Tendering is where this matters most, because the module already knows bids
arrive in more than one currency: it counts the ones it had to leave out on
that ground, under ``off_currency_excluded``. And the rejection notice goes to
the bidder who lost, who is the reader most likely to check the number against
their own submission.

Two things are measured, because either alone would pass against code that is
still broken. The rendered strings are pinned by equality rather than
containment, since ``"1,234" in out`` is satisfied by ``"1,234.00"``, which is
the output being fixed. Then the documents themselves, because a helper reading
the registry proves nothing about the four places that call it.
