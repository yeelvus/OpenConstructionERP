"""The deadline register has to name whoever the row was given to.

``owner_user_id`` is normalised from columns that carry no foreign key, and the
three writers behind them store three different things: a contact id when the
party is external (the demo seeder puts the main contractor on every punch
item), a user id when a picker names a teammate, and free text when somebody
types a name. The register resolved all of that against ``User`` alone, so
every row naming a contact came back with no ``owner_name`` - and the client,
which has no fallback of its own, printed "Unassigned" over a row that does
name somebody. That is a false statement about the row, not a missing one.

These tests pin the resolution and, just as importantly, the two misses that
have to stay misses: a row nobody was given to, and an id that resolves to
nothing. Echoing the second would print a raw UUID under a column headed by a
person's name, which is the defect this fix shares a root with.
