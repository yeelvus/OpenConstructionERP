        Returns ``(elements, total, boq_links_by_element_id,
        doc_links_by_element_id, task_links_by_element_id,
        activity_briefs_by_element_id, requirement_briefs_by_element_id,
        validation_summaries_by_element_id, current_pct_by_element_id,
        current_pct_date_by_element_id)`` where each brief is a plain dict
        with the fields expected by the corresponding Pydantic brief schema.

        ``current_pct_date_by_element_id`` maps each element id to the
        ISO-8601 recorded date of the headline progress entry (the same
        entry whose percentage lands in ``current_pct_by_element_id``), so
        the viewer can show "65% as of 2026-06-01" when an element is
        selected in the "By progress" overlay. Absent when the element has
        no linked progress or the winning entry carries no recorded date.

        ``current_pct_by_element_id`` maps each element id to the latest
        ``percent_complete`` (0-100) of the BOQ position(s) it is linked
        to.  When an element links to several positions we take the MAX of
        their latest percentages, because a human reading a "by progress"
        3D overlay reads the most-advanced linked work as the element's
        headline state.  Elements with no linked position (or with linked
        positions that have no ProgressEntry yet) are simply absent from
        the dict, so the viewer paints them neutral grey.

        BOQ briefs match ``BOQElementLinkBrief`` (id, boq_position_id,
        boq_position_ordinal, boq_position_description, link_type, confidence).

        Document briefs match ``DocumentLinkBrief`` (id, document_id,
        document_name, document_category, link_type, confidence).

        Task briefs match ``bim_hub.schemas.TaskBrief`` (id, project_id,
        title, status, task_type, due_date). Tasks are denormalised - each
        ``Task`` row carries a JSON ``bim_element_ids`` array - so we load
        all project tasks once and filter in Python. This is cross-dialect
        safe and correct for the bounded sizes we expect (< a few thousand
        tasks per project).

        Activity briefs match ``bim_hub.schemas.ActivityBrief`` (id, name,
        start_date, end_date, status, percent_complete). Activities are
        loaded through ``oe_schedule_schedule`` for the model's project and
        filtered in Python on their ``bim_element_ids`` JSON array - same
        rationale as tasks.

        This avoids an N+1 by issuing:
            1. A single SELECT on BIMElement with ``selectinload(boq_links)``.
            2. A single SELECT on Position for all distinct linked position ids.
            3. A single SELECT joining ``oe_documents_bim_link`` → ``oe_documents_document``
               filtered by the element ids in the current page.
            4. A single SELECT on Task for all tasks in the project containing
               the model.
            5. A single SELECT on Activity joined to Schedule for all
               activities in the model's project.
