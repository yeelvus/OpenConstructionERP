"""Check that a built desktop sidecar carries a usable embedded PostgreSQL.

The sidecar is a PyInstaller onefile executable: everything it needs is packed
into an archive appended to the binary and extracted to a temporary directory at
launch. If a file did not make it into that archive, nothing says so until a user
runs the installer on their own machine and the app stops at "Starting the local
database".

That is what happened in issue #419. The hook that collects the embedded
PostgreSQL tree used PyInstaller's ``collect_data_files``, which excludes every
suffix in ``importlib.machinery.all_suffixes()``. On Linux that list contains
``.so``, the exact suffix PostgreSQL gives its own loadable modules there, so
dict_snowball, plpgsql and the encoding converters were dropped from the bundle.
Windows and macOS name those same modules ``.dll`` and ``.dylib`` and came
through intact, so the break looked like a Linux-only mystery.

The hook now walks the tree itself and refuses to build without those modules.
This script is the second half: it reads the archive of the executable that was
actually produced and confirms the files are in it. A guard on the input and a
guard on the output catch different things - the hook cannot see a file that a
later build stage strips, and this cannot see a file the hook never offered.
