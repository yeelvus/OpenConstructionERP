"""A leftover ``postmaster.pid`` must not be believed just because its number is alive.

Operating systems reuse process identifiers, and Windows reuses them quickly.
A pidfile left behind by a force-killed postmaster keeps naming a number, and
once the system hands that number to an unrelated program the file describes a
process that has nothing to do with the cluster. Asking only whether the number
is alive therefore answers a different question than the one that matters.

This is the ordinary aftermath of upgrading rather than a rare accident: the
installer hooks force-kill the sidecar and its children on every install and
every uninstall, which is exactly what leaves the file behind.

Measured on a real machine before the fix: a pidfile written in July named a PID
then held by a licensing service, the check saw a live process and kept the
file, the cluster reported itself ready on a port where nothing was listening,
and the backend refused to start with a connection error. The user was told the
database was ready and the application server was not, which is the least
useful pair of statements the product could have made.

The blind spot of this file: it exercises the decision, not the boot. Whether
clearing the file actually returns the cluster to the clean-start path is a
property of pixeltable-pgserver and is covered where the cluster is really
started, not here.
