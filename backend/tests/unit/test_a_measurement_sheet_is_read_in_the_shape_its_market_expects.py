"""A measurement sheet has to come out in the shape its market's rules expect.

The measurement presets carry a ``region`` field, exactly like the price
breakdown presets did, and until now nothing resolved a preset from it. Both
endpoints took the preset by name with ``"international"`` as the default, so a
German quantity surveyor computing a take-off got the international sheet
unless they knew to type ``preset=reb`` into a query string, and an Austrian
one never reached OENORM A 2063 at all. Two country conventions shipped
complete and unreachable.

The second half matters as much as the first: the compute endpoint and the
saved-sheet endpoint are a pair. A take-off computed as a REB DA11 sheet and
read back as an international one is worse than either convention applied
consistently, so both endpoints are checked here rather than only the one the
audit named.

Germany and Austria are separate rows on purpose. Switzerland shares the
language with both and has no measurement preset of its own, which is the case
that separates "resolve from the market" from "hand over whatever looks close".
