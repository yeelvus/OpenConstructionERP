"""What an award hands to the contract draft it creates.

Two award paths draft a contract: ``bid_management.package.awarded`` (the
subscriber in ``notifications/_wave5_cross_module_subscribers.py``) and
``tendering.package.awarded`` (``bid_management/events.py``). Both need the
same three answers, and they live here so the two paths cannot drift apart:

* whether a contract for this award already exists, keyed on metadata rather
  than on the contract code, so a hand-made contract that happens to use the
  code does not swallow the award, and so the two paths converge on one
  contract when a bid package is linked to a tender package;
* a contract code that is free, since ``oe_contracts_contract.code`` is
  unique across the whole install;
* who the counterparty is. A bidder is a snapshot row that no contracts or
  finance reader can resolve, so the counterparty is the directory entry the
  bidder was linked to, or nothing, and never the bidder row itself.

Imports of the contracts and subcontractors models stay inside the functions:
this module is imported by bid_management at load time, and those modules are
plugins that may not be installed.
