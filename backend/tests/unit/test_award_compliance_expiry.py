"""The award gate reads the expiry dates the compliance register already holds.

Three registers on the platform carry expiry dates, but only one of them is
keyed to a counterparty: ``oe_subcontractors_certificate``, plus the
denormalised ``Subcontractor.insurance_expiry_date`` on the vendor row itself.
Until this gate read them, an expired insurance certificate was recorded,
displayed on the drawer, alerted on by the expiry cron - and did not stop the
award.

What is asserted here, in the order it matters:

* a lapsed blocking document refuses the award, and the refusal names the
  document and the day it lapsed;
* a document that lapsed and was then renewed does **not** refuse, which is the
  case a naive "latest row" or "maximum expiry" reading gets wrong;
* a lapsed document of a type nobody requires does not refuse, because a gate
  that bites on everything is a gate somebody switches off;
* missing and expired are told apart, and only expired blocks the award;
* the boundary on the expiry day itself, from both sides of midnight.
