"""Installing a country pack has to leave the workspace knowing which country.

A project created while a country pack is active inherited the pack's
estimating methodology and nothing else. Everything else in the product that
is country-specific reads ``Project.country_code``: the markup region a bill is
seeded with, the CPM working calendar, the compliance-pack resolver and the
measurement system. All four answer "no opinion" when that column is unset. So
installing the Hungarian pack fitted out the cascade and left every one of them
saying nothing was known about the market, on a workspace that had just been
told which market it was for.

The fix is one line of intent: when a country pack is active and the person
creating the project named no country, the pack's country is the answer. An
explicit choice always wins, and this only ever fills a blank.

Three things have to hold together for that to be safe, and this file gates
each of them:

* the pack has to state a market unambiguously, which is what
  ``market_country_code`` is for, including saying ``None`` clearly for the
  packs that name no country;
* the fill must never overwrite a country the user chose;
* the country it fills in must actually reach the thing this was for, which is
  the markup region the bill is seeded with.

The last one is the point of the whole change and the easiest to lose: a pack
could set a country that no national stack covers, and the bill would still be
priced with the neutral method while every check above passed.
