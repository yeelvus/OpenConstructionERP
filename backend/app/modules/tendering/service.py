    A tender package can cover part of a bill: ``create_from_boq`` freezes the
    chosen sections into ``line_item_template``, and the demo installer records
    the same thing as a plain ``scope_position_ids`` list. Both comparison
    screens read the package's whole BOQ, so without this narrowing the lines
    nobody was asked to price still land on the reference side, where every
    bidder reads as having omitted them. A package over a quarter of a bill
    then levels a bid of 812,400 to roughly four times that, because each
    out-of-scope line is imputed at the bidder's own mean rate, and compares it
    against a budget four times its own.

    Metadata that declares no scope means the package covers everything its
    BOQ holds, which is what every package created before this carried. A scope
    that matches nothing in the BOQ is stale metadata rather than an empty
    package, so it is ignored too: an empty matrix would be a worse answer than
    a wide one.

    Args:
        positions: BOQ positions as loaded for the package.

    it is.

    ``create_from_boq`` records the chosen sections as ``source_section_ids``.
    Packages that predate that, and the ones the demo installer writes, record
    only a flat position list, so the sections are derived by walking each
