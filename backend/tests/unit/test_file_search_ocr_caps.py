"""OOM guards for the file_search OCR rasteriser.

``_extract_ocr_text`` renders each PDF page to a pixmap before OCR. ``get_pixmap``
has no size ceiling, so a large-format sheet (an A0 drawing at 150 DPI is ~35 MP)
or a maliciously oversized page could allocate hundreds of MB and OOM a 3 GB
worker. These tests pin the pure render-scale clamp that bounds every page render
to ``MAX_OCR_PIXELS`` and confirm normal pages are rendered unchanged. Pure
functions - no fitz, no tesseract, no database.
