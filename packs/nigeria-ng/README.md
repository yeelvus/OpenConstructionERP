# Nigeria Construction Pack

Configures OpenConstructionERP for the Nigerian construction market. Measurement
follows BESMM3 (Building and Engineering Standard Method of Measurement, 3rd
edition), the standard used by Nigerian quantity surveyors. Currency is NGN with
7.5% VAT on construction services. The NBS (Nigerian Building Standards) and NIQS
(Nigerian Institute of Quantity Surveyors) practice frameworks are referenced.

## What makes a Nigerian estimate Nigerian

A bill of quantities in Nigeria is measured to BESMM3, the method developed by the
Nigerian Institute of Quantity Surveyors. The format follows the UK tradition - the
QS profession in Nigeria is RICS-aligned - but BESMM adapts the measurement rules
to local construction methods and materials, particularly for reinforced concrete
frame construction which dominates Nigerian building.

Public procurement follows the Public Procurement Act 2007 administered by the
Bureau of Public Procurement. The National Building Code 2006 sets the regulatory
framework. Professional practice is governed by NIQS for quantity surveyors, COREN
for engineers and ARCON for architects.

VAT on construction services is 7.5 percent. The pack sets the `ng_vat_7_5` tax
template.
