"""The classification registry answers by country, not by string shape.

The defect these tests exist for: ``PL`` resolved to DIN 276 while
``PL_WARSAW`` resolved to MasterFormat. Sixteen countries answered two
ways depending on whether a city happened to be appended, because the
city-suffix safety net in the old resolver only fired when the whole
region string missed the lookup, and a catalogue region id never missed
it - the catalogue loop had already inserted it with a default standard.

So the test that matters here is not a roster of expected answers. It is
an invariant driven from the registry and from the shipped catalogues,
which means a country added tomorrow is covered without anyone
remembering to add a case.
