"""Which asyncio event loop the HTTP server runs on.

On Windows the server keeps the proactor loop that uvicorn picks there by
default, with one change: a failed accept is retried instead of ending the
server. Linux and macOS are untouched and keep whatever uvicorn chooses.

The defect. CPython's proactor loop closes the LISTENING socket when one accept
fails. ``BaseProactorEventLoop._start_serving`` (Lib/asyncio/proactor_events.py
in 3.12) catches any ``OSError`` from the accept future, logs "Accept failed on
a socket" and calls ``sock.close()`` on the listener, and nothing opens it
again. The process stays up, the port refuses every connection, and to a
desktop user the app is frozen until it is restarted. One client that resets
its connection while it waits in the listen backlog is enough: Windows then
completes the next ``AcceptEx`` with ``ERROR_NETNAME_DELETED`` (WinError 64).
Browsers do that when the server is slow to accept, which is when it happened
in the field: a test server logged the WinError 64 at 11:45:08 and never
accepted another connection.

The fix. The loop gets a proactor whose ``accept`` hides those per-connection
errors from ``_start_serving``: when the pending ``AcceptEx`` fails because the
client went away, it posts a new one on the same listener and the future
``_start_serving`` holds simply resolves later, with the next client. Any other
error, a closed listener, or a cancellation still reaches ``_start_serving``
unchanged, so shutting the server down works as before.

Why not the selector loop, which has no such accept path: on Windows it loses
outgoing data. ``_SelectorSocketTransport._write_send`` pops a buffer off the
queue before ``send()`` and drops it when ``send()`` raises
``BlockingIOError``. Windows sockets have no ``sendmsg``, so that is the only
write path there, and asyncpg's ``executemany`` feeds it through
``writelines``. Measured on Windows 11 / CPython 3.12.11 against PostgreSQL:
an ``executemany`` of 346 UPDATE statements applied 313 of them and reported
success. A server that silently skips writes is worse than one that stops
answering.
``backend/tests/unit/test_the_windows_server_loop_survives_a_reset_client.py``
replays the accept failure with real sockets.
