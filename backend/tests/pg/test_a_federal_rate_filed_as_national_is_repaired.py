"""Canadian GST filed as ``national`` is not a label problem, it is a wrong total.

``v3302_tax_combination`` backfilled ``combination`` on the thirteen Canadian
and United States rows, and a revision body never executes on the boot path, so
an upgraded install has all thirteen on the column's server default. Eleven of
them are sub-national and ``tax_subdivision_backfill`` rewrites them, because
the table's check constraint will not let it write a subdivision without saying
how the rate combines. The two country-wide rows are outside that: no
subdivision either way, no constraint breached, no repair reaching them.

They break nothing loudly, which is the reason to test them at all. The
resolver splits the active rows by ``combination`` and only the ``federal``
list is the base a sub-national rate is measured against, so a GST row filed as
``national`` empties that list and every Canadian answer that leans on the base
moves. The assertions below are on resolved rates rather than on the column,
because the column is the mechanism and the rate is what a quantity surveyor
puts in a tender.

The harmonised provinces are the trap and are asserted for that reason. Ontario
comes out at 13 % either way, because a ``replaces_federal`` rate never reads
the base - so the province most likely to be spot-checked is the one that looks
right while British Columbia is understated by five points.
