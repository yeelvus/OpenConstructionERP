"""EN 16931 business rules, evaluated in Python.

A receiver validates an incoming e-invoice against the EN 16931 Schematron (in
Germany, the KoSIT validator). Every finding it reports carries a rule
identifier such as ``BR-61`` or ``BR-CO-15``, and that identifier, not the
wording, is what the sender has to act on.

This module evaluates the same rules natively. Running a Schematron engine
would mean a JVM or an XSLT processor plus the rule artefacts, which the
platform's 2GB-VPS budget does not have room for; the rules themselves are
small predicates over the semantic model, so they are expressed here directly.
Each one cites the identifier a receiver would report, which keeps our finding
and theirs comparable. This is a well-cited subset, not the full artefact: it
covers the rules an invoice assembled from platform data can actually break.

Identifier namespaces used here:
    * ``BR-*`` / ``BR-CO-*``  EN 16931-1 content and calculation rules
    * ``BR-S-*``, ``BR-Z-*``, ``BR-E-*``, ``BR-AE-*``, ``BR-IC-*``,
      ``BR-G-*``, ``BR-O-*``  the per VAT-category rule families
    * ``BR-DE-*``  XRechnung (KoSIT) national rules
    * ``PEPPOL-EN16931-*``  Peppol BIS Billing 3.0 rules
    * ``OCE-*``  house advisories, warning severity, not part of any standard
