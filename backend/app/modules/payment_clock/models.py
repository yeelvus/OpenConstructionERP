"""Payment clock ORM models.

Tables:
    oe_payment_clock_regime      - one statutory payment regime
    oe_payment_clock_application - a payment application under a regime
    oe_payment_clock_notice      - a notice served in the sequence
    oe_payment_clock_event       - a computed breach and its consequence

The class is called :class:`StatutoryPaymentApplication` rather than
``PaymentApplication`` because two other modules already declare a model by
that name (``subcontractors`` and ``cvr``), and the thing stored here is not a
third payment application. It is the statutory clock *over* an application that
lives somewhere else: the same subcontractor payment application can be one row
there and one row here, and the two say different things.

No ``relationship()`` is declared anywhere in this module. A notice and an
event point at their application by id, and an application points at its
regime by id, so every read is an explicit query and there is no lazy-loading
strategy to get wrong.

Nothing is ever queried *inside* a JSON column. On PostgreSQL a ``.contains()``
on a plain JSON column compiles to a string LIKE rather than to JSONB
containment, so a filter written that way would silently mean something else.
``PaymentClockEvent.detail`` is written and read whole.

# arithmetic for.

# How a deadline counts days. Australian and Singaporean statutes say "business
# days", the New Zealand Act says "working days"; both mean the same thing here

#       payable, and no defence to it survives. This is the rule the module
#       exists for (United Kingdom, Ireland, New South Wales, Queensland,
#       New Zealand).
#   evidential_bar - the payer stays free to dispute the amount but may not
#       raise at adjudication any reason it did not put in the response
#       (Singapore).
#   deemed_dispute - failing to respond disputes the whole claim rather than
#       conceding it, so the claimant's next step is adjudication, not a debt
#       claim (Malaysia).
#   none - the regime has no notice sequence at all and only supplies a
