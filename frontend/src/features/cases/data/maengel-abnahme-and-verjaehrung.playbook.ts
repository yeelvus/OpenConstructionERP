// Case: "Maengel, Abnahme and the Verjaehrung clock" (DE).
//
// The end of a German project is a legal sequence, not a mood. Walk the site
// and log every Mangel with photo and location, drive the list to zero or to
// agreed exceptions, hold the formal Abnahme whose protocol decides when risk
// passes and the Verjaehrung starts, then track the defects through the
// liability period on the limitation the contract actually gives you: four
// years for building works under VOB/B, five under a BGB Werkvertrag. Content
// strings are key plus inline English default and live only here.
