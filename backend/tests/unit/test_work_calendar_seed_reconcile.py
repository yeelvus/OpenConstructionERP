"""The work calendar reconciler agrees with the file it delivers from.

The reconciler itself needs a database and is covered where the other boot-path
repairs are. What is checked here is the half that does not: the table of ship
dates, the anchors derived from it, and the row builder both the seeder and the
reconciler go through. Those are the parts that rot silently when somebody adds
a country to ``work_calendars.json`` and nothing tells them there is a second
place to write.
