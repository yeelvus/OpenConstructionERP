"""Guard the seam between what a partner pack declares and what the engine has.

``validation_rule_packs`` carries two kinds of name at once: identifiers of
built-in rule sets, which switch those rules on, and ids of the JSON documents
the pack ships under ``rule_packs/``, which the engine never executes. Both are
intended. The failure mode is a third thing that looks like the second: a pack
naming a standard the engine DOES implement, spelled with separators the
registry does not use, so the rules sit there unused while the installer
reports only "no built-in engine match".

The test that existed before this one asserted ``rule_registry.has_rules()``
for a handful of set names. That is a fact about the registry and it was true
the whole time; no manifest was ever read, so it could not have caught any of
this. This file reads the manifests.

What this file no longer does is allow-list. It used to hold the fifteen
pairings that were wrong on the day it was written and assert that the scan
found exactly those, which grandfathered all fifteen and could only have caught
a sixteenth. The requirement that a pack actually declare the engine identifier
now lives in ``test_partner_pack_rule_sets.py``, against the
``validation_rule_sets`` field that switches rules on. What stays here is the
detector, the probes, and the controls that stop either from going quiet.

Everything here measures in a subprocess, and that is not incidental. The
registry is not a constant: ``register_builtin_rules`` puts 29 sets in it, and
each module that owns validators adds its own on import, so the answer depends
on what the process happens to have loaded. Run in a pytest session that has
already built an app, this file saw ``boq_quality`` holding 23 rules; run
alone, 19. A guard whose subject changes with test ordering is worse than no
guard, so each helper starts a clean interpreter and loads a stated set.
