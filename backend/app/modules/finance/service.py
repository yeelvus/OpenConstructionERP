        The direction follows the contract's counterparty. A claim on a client
        contract is money the client owes us, so it is raised as a receivable.
        A claim on a subcontract is the subcontractor billing us, so it is a
        payable: booking it as a receivable put a subcontractor's bill into
        accounts receivable and its retainage into the retention we hold from
        the client. The name keeps its original wording because the route and
        its callers use it.

        Idempotent: if an invoice already carries this ``claim_id`` in its
        ``source_claim_id`` column it is returned unchanged (event replay /
        double certification / concurrent calls all converge on one row).

        The claim's contract supplies the project and counterparty; the claim
        supplies the gross / retention / net figures. Each ``ProgressClaimLine``
        becomes one ``InvoiceLineItem`` (3 claim lines → 3 invoice items). The
        claim's gross lands in ``amount_subtotal`` / ``amount_total`` and the
        retainage in ``retention_amount``; the net collectible is therefore
        ``amount_total - retention_amount``. Storing the gross (not the net)
        keeps retention a single deduction so the payment-time withholding never
        double-counts it.

        Multi-currency: amounts denominated in the claim currency are converted
        into the project base currency via ``Project.fx_rates`` before storing.
        A currency with no configured rate keeps its own value (never zeroed) so
        a forgotten rate surfaces as a visibly-wrong figure rather than dropping
        money silently.

        Raises:
            HTTPException 404 when the claim or its contract is missing.

        Locking a bill is what makes it the budget. The lock itself fills the
        cost model's budget lines; this is the finance side of the same step,
        so the finance dashboard and the Budgets tab stop reading zero after a
        lock (they read ``ProjectBudget``, which nothing used to fill).

        * Only priced leaves count. A section row carries the subtotal of its
          children, and summing it as well would count the bill twice.
        * Rows are keyed ``(wbs_id, category="estimate")``, the category that
          marks them as generated. Each row records what every bill put into
          it under ``from_boq:<boq_id>``, so locking the same bill again
          replaces that bill's share instead of adding it twice, and a second
          bill on the same WBS adds to the first rather than overwriting it.
        * A change in the original budget moves the revised budget by the same
          amount, so revisions already booked against the row survive.
        * A bill that already has a budget from the "Create Budget" button of
          18.0 and earlier (rows stamped ``boq_id`` in their metadata) keeps
          that budget and gets no second one. Those rows may carry revisions
          and synced figures, so they are neither converted nor replaced.

        This is the only writer of a bill's finance budget: the lock reaches it
        through ``costmodel.budget.generated`` and the "Create Budget" endpoint
        calls it directly, so whichever runs first, the other finds the bill's
        share already there.

        Amounts are net of VAT, as a bill is, in the project currency.

        Args:
            project_id: Project the bill belongs to.
            boq_id: The bill that was locked.

        Returns:
