"""Running an upgrade of this install, and knowing when it cannot be run at all.

The desktop app ships as a PyInstaller sidecar, so ``sys.executable`` there is
the frozen binary rather than an interpreter. A ``[sys.executable, "-m", "pip",
"install", ...]`` command therefore feeds its own tokens straight back into this
application's argparse CLI, which answers ``invalid choice: 'pip'`` and shows
the user a usage dump where an upgrade should have been (issue #403). The
bundle carries no pip to fix that with either: on the desktop the installer
replaces the whole application.

Two places build that command - the ``/api/system/upgrade`` route and the
``upgrade`` CLI command - and both must refuse identically, so the decision and
the wording live here rather than being written out twice.

The upgrade itself also lives here, as a job rather than a function call.
Downloading a release, resolving its dependencies and installing them takes as
long as it takes, which on a slow link is minutes, and no request can be held
open that long: the browser gave up at 45 seconds and reported a failure over
an upgrade that was still running and would go on to succeed (issue #430). Worse
than the wrong message, the work ran inline in the event loop of a single worker
process, so for its whole duration the server answered nothing at all, and the
user watching it had no way to tell a stuck upgrade from a slow one.

So the request starts a job and returns its id, the work runs in a thread, and
the state is polled. One job runs at a time; asking again while one is running
returns the one already going rather than starting a second pip against the same
site-packages.

The registry is in this process's memory on purpose. An upgrade ends by asking
the user to restart, and a restart is exactly what discards the record, which is
correct: after the restart the installed version answers the question the job
was tracking. Deployments that run more than one worker cannot share a lock this
way and should turn the route off with ``ALLOW_RUNTIME_UPGRADE=false``, which is
what a pipeline-managed install wants regardless.
