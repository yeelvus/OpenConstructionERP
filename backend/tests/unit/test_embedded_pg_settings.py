"""The embedded cluster gets the lock headroom the platform's schema needs.

PostgreSQL sizes its lock table as ``max_locks_per_transaction`` times
``max_connections`` and shares it across the whole cluster. Creating or
reflecting this platform's schema locks well over a thousand objects, so with
the default of 64 a few connections doing that at once run the pool dry and the
statement fails with "out of shared memory" -- which reads like a memory problem
and is really a configuration one.

These tests drive the config writer against a temporary directory, so they need
no cluster and cannot disturb the session's own.
