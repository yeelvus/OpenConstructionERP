// Case: "Price a variation and agree the extension of time" (GB).
//
// One change, from the notice that preserves the entitlement to the order
// that closes it. JCT calls it a variation and a relevant event, NEC4 calls
// it a compensation event with a time bar, and both are decided on records
// taken while the work was happening. Content strings are key plus inline

  longDescDefault:
    "JCT and NEC4 handle a change identically in substance and very differently in procedure. Under JCT the contract administrator issues an instruction, the work is valued under the valuation rules, and delay runs through a relevant event and an extension of time. Under NEC4 the same fact is a compensation event: notified inside a time bar, quoted, and assessed against the accepted programme with cost and time settled together. What both forms share is that the entitlement is won or lost by the records taken while the work was happening, not by the argument made afterwards. This case runs one change from notice to agreed order and posts it against the contract sum, so the final account is a running total rather than a reconciliation.",
