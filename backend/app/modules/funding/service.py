"""Public funding business logic.

Three things here are worth more than the CRUD around them.

**Deadlines are derived, once, from the award.** The moment an award is
recorded, every date the programme's own terms imply becomes knowable: when
the report is due, how long money may sit unspent, how long the vouchers must
be kept. Working them out at read time would mean every screen recomputes
them and a change to the programme's terms silently moves a deadline that has
already been communicated to a person. So they are written down as
obligations, once, and the rows say they came from a programme rule.

**Rollups are derived, always.** Approved against drawn against received is
the question every funding officer asks, and each part already lives in a
row. A stored total is the copy that is wrong in the screenshot somebody
forwards to an auditor.

**Validation is part of reading an application, not a screen somebody opens.**
``GET /applications/{id}`` returns the findings with the record.
