"""The buyer of one invoice, resolved from the contact that invoice already names.

EN 16931 wants the buyer's postal address (BG-8), and XRechnung makes the city
and the post code of it mandatory (BR-DE-8, BR-DE-9). None of that is invoice
data. It describes the counterparty, which this platform already stores once in
the contacts directory, so an invoice that names a contact should not have to be
told again who is being invoiced and where they are.

The result is handed to ``build_einvoice`` inside ``defaults`` and never as its
``buyer`` argument. ``defaults`` is the floor the document overrides; the
argument is a ceiling it cannot. A buyer typed onto one invoice has to keep
winning over the standing record, which is what makes a one-off recipient still
expressible.

Nothing here parses a free-text address. A contact whose address was captured
before this existed holds a single unstructured line under ``text``, and that
line becomes the address line as written. Splitting a city or a post code out of
it would work on the addresses we happen to have and mis-file the ones we do
not, and a wrongly split post code is worse than an absent one: the absent one
is reported to the user by BR-DE-9, the wrong one is silently exported.
