"""BOQ Pydantic schemas - request/response models.

Defines create, update, and response schemas for BOQs, positions, markups,
structured (sectioned) BOQ responses, templates, and activity log entries.

Numeric values (quantity, unit_rate, total) are stored as strings in
SQLite-compatible models and are exposed on ``PositionResponse`` as plain
decimal strings, not floats - see the BUG-B-011 note on that schema for why.
Schemas that carry a measurement with no money beside it may still type it as
a float; each schema states which it uses.

#:
#: A bill's consumption tax is a markup row of category ``tax``. It has never
#: been a column: ``BOQ`` does not declare ``tax_rate``, the service never
#: reads or writes it, and ``BOQTotals`` says outright that the matching
#: output fields hold their defaults for wire compatibility only. The input
#: side went on advertising the field with a worked example anyway, and the
#: two paths lost the value differently. ``create_boq`` builds its ``BOQ``
#: from a named field list, so a rate sent to ``POST /boqs/`` was dropped and
#: the caller got 201. ``update_boq`` dumps the payload straight into
#: ``BOQRepository.update_fields``, so a rate sent to ``PATCH /boqs/{id}``
#: reached ``update(BOQ).values(tax_rate=...)`` and raised
#: ``CompileError: Unconsumed column names: tax_rate``, which the global
#: handler at ``app.main`` turns into an opaque 500.
#:
#: Refusing it is the answer this file already gives a ``per_unit`` markup
#: (see ``MarkupCreate.markup_type``): a value the engine has no way to use is
#: rejected at the schema rather than accepted and dropped.

    * ``subtotal`` - applies to the direct-cost subtotal **plus the sum
      of all preceding markup lines** (e.g. VAT/output tax on the
      contractor price including overhead & profit). Behaves identically
      to ``cumulative``; the alias is retained for GAEB/legacy clients
      that label the tax base "subtotal".
    * ``cumulative`` - applies to the running total *including all
      prior markups*. When multiple markups have ``apply_to='cumulative'``
      they are evaluated in ``sort_order`` ASC, and each cumulative
      markup's base is the direct-cost subtotal **plus** every PRIOR
      markup (cumulative, subtotal or direct_cost) in the same BOQ. This
      compounds profit-on-overhead-on-cost, the GAEB / DIN 276 default.
      Reorder markups by changing ``sort_order``; ties are stable by ``id``.

    ``scope_position_id`` and ``overrides_id`` express inheritance with
    override. Leaving both unset creates a bill-wide line, the company
    standard, which is what every markup was before these existed. Naming a
    position confines the line to that position and everything under it, and
    naming ``overrides_id`` as well makes it stand in for that bill-wide line
    inside its own subtree. An override keeps the place of the line it
    replaces in the compounding order, so an exception changes the rate and
    never the order.
