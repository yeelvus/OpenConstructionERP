/**
 * Reduce an update payload to the fields the user actually edited.
 *
 * Edit forms here prefill from a record that was read at some earlier point and
 * then PATCH every field back, whether or not it was touched. That silently
 * undoes somebody else's work: you open a record, change the title, save, and
 * the description you never looked at is written back as it stood when your
 * copy was loaded, overwriting an edit made in between. Nobody sees an error,
 * because from the server's side it is an ordinary write.
 *
 * The update routes are PATCH over Pydantic models dumped with
 * `exclude_unset=True`, so a field left out of the body is left alone in the
 * database. Sending only what changed therefore narrows the window from every
 * field on the form to the single field two people edited at once, which no
 * amount of client-side care can fix without a version token.
 *
 * `base` must be the form state as it was first initialized, not the raw
 * record, so that both sides have been through the same normalization. That is
 * what keeps a date rendered as `2026-08-01` from reading as different to the
 * `2026-08-01T00:00:00` it came from, and stops a currency filled in from the
 * project default from being written onto a record that never had one.
 *
 * Clearing a field is still a change: form `''` against a base holding a value
 * is dirty, and the caller's payload maps it to `null`. Only an untouched field
 * is dropped. An empty result means nothing was edited, and the resulting empty
 * PATCH is a no-op the backend already handles.
 *
 * A payload key with no field of the same name on the form is always sent. The
 * key/value types line up in the signature, but `Object.keys` runs on the real
 * object, so a payload carrying something the form does not hold - an id, a
 * value derived from elsewhere on the page - would compare `undefined` against
 * `undefined`, read as untouched and be dropped from the body. Erring towards
 * sending it costs at most one redundant field; erring the other way silently
 * removes one the caller meant to write.
