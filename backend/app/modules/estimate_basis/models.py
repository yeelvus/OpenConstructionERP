"""Estimate-basis ORM models.

Tables:
    oe_estimate_basis_document - one drafted, editable basis-of-estimate per
        generation, scoped to a project (and optionally the BOQ it was drawn
        from). The three qualification lists and the coverage snapshot are held
        as JSON so a regenerate or a user edit is a single-row write.

class EstimateBasis(Base):
    """A drafted basis-of-estimate (inclusions, exclusions, assumptions).

    Columns:
        project_id - owning project (CASCADE on delete).
        boq_id - the BOQ the basis was generated from, when a single BOQ was
            targeted; ``None`` means it spans every BOQ of the project. Kept as a
            bare indexed GUID (no hard FK) so deleting a BOQ never cascades away
            the client-facing document.
        title - human-readable heading for the document.
        status - ``draft`` while being edited, ``final`` once signed off.
        inclusions / exclusions / assumptions - JSON lists of qualification
            dicts (see :class:`.derivation.Qualification`); each item carries a
            stable id, its text, the trade it derives from and an enabled flag,
            so the UI edits, reorders and toggles lines without losing identity.
        coverage - JSON snapshot of the present/absent trade picture and quality
            flags at generation time, so the export shows the basis even after
            the source estimate moves on.
        currency / financials / provenance / pricing_date - the derived half of
            the document: the money it qualifies, where its lines came from, and
            the date its rates are current to. All snapshots, for the same
            reason ``coverage`` is one.
        estimate_class / accuracy_low_pct / accuracy_high_pct /
            market_conditions / contingency_rationale - the human half. The
            platform suggests a class from the evidence; only an estimator
            stores one.
        generated_at - ISO-8601 UTC timestamp of the derivation.
        created_by - the user who generated the document (provenance).
        metadata_ - module-extensible blob.
