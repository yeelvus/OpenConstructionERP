"""No project id can seed a demo register with an empty overdue tile.

The seeder derives its random number generator from the project id, so the
register is redrawn for every project and everything the demo screens show is a
draw. The overdue tile lost that draw: the seeder decided a row was settled
using its own pair of statuses while the report exempts a third, paused, from
ever counting as overdue, so a paused row got a past date the report then
refused to count. Measured over twenty thousand drawn ids, that emptied the tile
on 229 of them - roughly one register in eighty-seven, which fails a lane once
and then passes for a week.

The fix reserves the second position of every register for a status the report
can count and dates it into the past, so an overdue row is there by
construction. This asserts that as a property of the seeder rather than as an
observation about one project: the invariants that make it structural, checked
across drawn ids, party-pool sizes and ordinals.

The seeder itself is driven here, against a stub session that answers the three
lookups the way an empty database would. A paraphrase of the draw would only
test this reading of it. ``_seed_project`` is called directly rather than
through ``seed_interface_management_demo`` because the wrapper swallows a
per-project exception, which would turn a broken seeder into a silently smaller
population.
