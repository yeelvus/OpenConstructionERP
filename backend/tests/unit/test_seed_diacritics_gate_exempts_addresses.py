"""The diacritics gate must not ask for an accented email address.

A stripped spelling is correct inside an email address and wrong in a display
string, and the demo packs carry both on the same line for the same firm:

    ("Kurpfalz Kältetechnik GmbH", "vergabe@kurpfalz-kaelte.de", ...)

Before the exemption the gate reported all twenty-nine addresses in the packs and
instructed the reader to write the accented form. Following that instruction
breaks every one of the addresses, and the gate then goes green. That is the
failure this file exists to prevent, so the controls matter more than the
positive case: a test that only checks an address is ignored would also pass
against a gate that had been switched off.
