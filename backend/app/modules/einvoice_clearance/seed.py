"""Demo seed for the e-invoice clearance module.

Loaded on demand via ``await seed_einvoice_clearance_demo(session, project_ids)``.

The gap this closes
===================
The module shipped complete and unseeded, so ``/einvoice-clearance`` was empty
on every install: no registration, no document, no trail. A visitor could read
the explainer about what an authority answers and then look at a screen where
nothing had ever been answered.

Seeded through the module's own service
=======================================
The document is not written as rows. It is prepared, checked and submitted
through :mod:`app.modules.einvoice_clearance.service`, the same three calls the
router makes, so the statuses, the ordering and the identifier are produced by
the state machine rather than described by this file. A second description of
the transition sequence is a second thing that can be wrong, and the trail is
only worth showing if it is the trail the machine actually writes.

The payload is likewise the real one: the service renders the invoice with the
EN 16931 engine, so what the screen offers for download is the XRechnung a user
would get from the export route, hashed from the exact bytes.

Nothing is assumed about which invoice
======================================
The invoice is resolved by :func:`showcase_invoices`, which looks up the number
the demo pack declares on the project that pack installed. The country, the
seller and the buyer reference all come off that invoice; the regime, the
platform and the format come from the country registry. When any of it cannot
be resolved the project is skipped with a log line and nothing is written,
because a clearance document pointing at no invoice is a fiscal record of
nothing - worse than the empty screen it was meant to fix.

Sandbox, deliberately
=====================
The registration is a sandbox one and the submission acknowledges the warning
that says so. Both are forced by what the module is: the offline reference
adapter refuses to serve a live registration (it would be minting identifiers no
authority has ever issued), and a sandbox registration on a real invoice raises
a warning that blocks an unacknowledged submission. Turning either off does not
produce a "more realistic" demo - it produces a rejected document.
