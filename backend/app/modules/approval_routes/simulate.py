"""Dry-run simulator for approval routes.

A route author needs to see what a template will do *before* anyone starts a
real workflow on it: how many approvals each step needs, whether a step can
ever clear, and what a single rejection does. This module answers that
question without touching the database.

The single source of truth for "is this step cleared?" lives in
:func:`step_cleared`, which is also called by the live engine
(``service.ApprovalRouteService._maybe_advance``). Keeping one implementation
means the dry run can never drift from what the engine actually does.
