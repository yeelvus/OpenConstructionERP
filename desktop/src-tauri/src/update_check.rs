// OpenConstructionERP Desktop, launcher-side update check.
//
// Why this exists, and why it lives in the launcher rather than in the app.
//
// The application already tells a user about a new release from inside itself:
// `GET /api/system/version-check` answers the question and a sidebar card shows
// it. That whole path needs a backend that started. Version 15.0.0 shipped
// without the locale catalogue its sidecar reads while starting, so on every
// machine the backend died during startup and the window never got past the
// splash. The people it happened to are exactly the people who most need to
// hear that a fixed build exists, and they are the only people the in-app
// notice can never reach, because the notice is served by the thing that did
// not start.
//
// So the launcher asks the question for itself, over one plain HTTPS GET, and
// says the answer in the failure window that today only offers to mail a log
// file. It never speaks on a healthy start: the application's own notice covers
// that, and two cards saying the same thing is noise.
//
// A VERSION CHECK THAT CAN STOP THE PRODUCT FROM STARTING IS A WORSE BUG THAN
// THE ONE IT IS THERE TO CATCH. Every failure here - no network, a rate-limited
// API, a proxy answering with its own login page, a machine with no DNS, a
// malformed tag - ends in exactly one thing: nothing is said, and startup is
// untouched. Nothing in this file is ever awaited by the startup path.
//
// Privacy. This is an outbound request to a third party on every start of an
// AGPL product that people run on private networks, so: it is one anonymous
// GET, it sends no identifier, no telemetry and no version of ours (the
// user-agent below is a bare product token with no version in it, because
// GitHub rejects a request with no user-agent at all), the notice says on its
// face that GitHub was asked, an administrator can turn it off for a whole
// image with an environment variable, and the user can turn it off from the
// notice itself.
