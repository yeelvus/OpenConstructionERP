"""Deterministic demo seed for the HSE Advanced module.

Generates realistic volumes per PRD scope:

    30   toolbox topics (catalogue / library)
    50   JSAs (mix of statuses, varied risk scores)
    40   permits-to-work across types/statuses
    200  toolbox talks
    2000 toolbox attendance rows
    80   PPE issues
    50   safety audits with 300 audit findings
    80   CAPAs (mix overdue / open / closed)
    30   worker safety certifications
    1-2  incident investigations per project, opened on real safety incidents

All randomness is seeded with ``random.Random(42)`` for reproducible runs.

Idempotent: if any HSE-Advanced table already holds rows the bulk seed is a
no-op. Investigations are the exception and are guarded on their own, per
project - see :func:`_seed_investigations` for why a whole-module sentinel
cannot reach them.
