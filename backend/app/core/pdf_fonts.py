"""Unicode font registration for every reportlab-generated PDF.

OpenEstimate principle #2 is *i18n EVERYWHERE*. reportlab's built-in Type-1
fonts (Helvetica / Times / Courier) are Latin-1 only, so any PDF that renders
Cyrillic (ru, bg, uk, sr), Greek, or the many accented Latin scripts with the
default font shows empty boxes ("tofu") instead of text. A construction ERP
that ships 29 locales but prints unreadable invoices and contracts in half of
them is broken.

This module bundles **DejaVu Sans** (regular + bold) and registers it with
reportlab once per process. DejaVu covers Latin, Latin-Extended, Cyrillic and
Greek - i.e. every locale this product ships *except* the complex scripts
(Arabic, Hebrew, CJK, Thai, Devanagari), which need much larger Noto fonts and
proper bidi/shaping. For the covered scripts the fix is complete: glyphs
render, not boxes.

Chinese is handled separately and without bundling anything, because reportlab
ships CID font *metrics* for the Adobe Asian font packs and can reference them
by name. ``pdf_font_for_text`` returns the CID face for text that needs it and
the DejaVu face for everything else, so a Chinese document does not change the
face a German one prints in. The other complex scripts remain a documented
follow-up.

**The CID face is referenced, not embedded.** A PDF using it carries the text
and the metrics but not the outlines, so it renders wherever the reader can
supply an Adobe Simplified Chinese face - which every mainstream desktop and
browser viewer does, and an offline or minimal viewer may not. That is the
trade for not carrying a 16 MB font in the repository, and it is a real
limitation rather than a footnote: a document that must render identically
everywhere needs an embedded font, which is a separate decision with a size
cost attached.

Usage in a generator::

    from app.core.pdf_fonts import BODY_FONT, BOLD_FONT, register_pdf_fonts

    register_pdf_fonts()            # idempotent; call once at the top
    canvas.setFont(BODY_FONT, 10)   # instead of "Helvetica"
    canvas.setFont(BOLD_FONT, 12)   # instead of "Helvetica-Bold"

A generator that can be handed Chinese - which in this product means any
generator that prints project names, item descriptions or party names, because
that is where Chinese arrives - asks for the face per string instead::

    from app.core.pdf_fonts import pdf_font_for_text, pdf_style_for_text, pdf_table_font_commands

    canvas.setFont(pdf_font_for_text(title, bold=True), 12)
    Paragraph(html.escape(desc), pdf_style_for_text(styles["cell"], desc))
    table.setStyle(TableStyle([*base_commands, *pdf_table_font_commands(rows)]))

Per string rather than per document on purpose. The faces cover different
scripts and none covers all of them, so a document mixing a Chinese supplier
name into German text renders correctly only if the choice is made at the string
that is being drawn.

The choice is made by asking the font, not by testing the codepoint against a
range. ``font_can_draw`` reads the TrueType character map, or a Type-1 built-in's
own encoding vector, and reports whether that face has a glyph. A string is then
given the lowest face on a ladder - the generator's existing face, then the
bundled Unicode face, then the Chinese pack - that can draw every character in
it. Two things follow, and both matter more than the tidiness. A string the old
face could already draw never leaves the first rung, so wiring a generator up
does not move a single byte of its existing Latin output. And a string the old
face could not draw escalates whatever the reason: Cyrillic and Greek get the
same treatment as Han, which a range test named for one script would never have
given them.

Known limitation, right-to-left scripts. Arabic and Hebrew escalate to the
bundled Unicode face like any other script this module cannot draw in the base
face, and that face has the glyphs, so the correct codepoints reach the content
stream and a reader can select and copy the text. What this module does not do
is lay them out. There is no bidirectional reordering and no contextual
shaping, so Arabic letters are drawn in their isolated forms rather than joined
to their neighbours, and both scripts are drawn in logical order rather than
visual order. On the page that reads backwards. The choice is deliberate: boxes
destroy the codepoints and cannot be recovered by anything downstream, whereas
this keeps the data correct and gets the presentation wrong, which is the
better failure on a document whose text has to be verifiable against the
structured data beside it. It is still wrong, and implementing bidi and shaping
is the fix.

``register_pdf_fonts()`` is safe to call from many generators and many times;
it registers at most once and never raises if the bundled TTFs are missing
(it falls back to Helvetica and logs a warning, so PDF generation degrades
rather than crashing).

    """``FONTNAME`` commands for exactly the table cells their base face cannot draw.

    A bare string in a reportlab table is drawn with the face the ``TableStyle``
    names, so a per-paragraph choice never reaches it: this is where a
    half-wired generator keeps printing boxes while every other assertion
    passes. Append the returned commands after the table's own style and the
    later command wins for those cells only.

    ``base`` is the face those cells are drawn in today. A cell that face can
    already draw produces no command at all, so the table's Latin output is
    untouched and its column widths do not move. Pass what the table actually
    uses, and note that this is rarely one face: a table that names a
    ``FONTNAME`` for its header row and none for its body has a bold Unicode
    header sitting on top of a body that reportlab draws in **Helvetica**,
    because that is what a cell with no ``FONTNAME`` over it falls back to.
    Give the header rows with ``header_rows`` and ``header_base`` so they are
    measured against the face they really have. Getting that wrong is not
    harmless: a header already drawn in a bold Unicode face would otherwise be
    handed a command putting it back to the regular weight.

    Cells holding a flowable (a ``Paragraph``) are skipped, because a flowable
    draws itself with its own style and a ``FONTNAME`` command would not reach
    it anyway. Give those the treatment from :func:`pdf_style_for_text`.

    Bold cells resolve to the same single-weight CJK face, so a Chinese heading
    is legible and simply not heavier. That is the same trade
    :func:`register_cjk_font` documents.

    Args:
        rows: The table's data, row-major, as handed to ``Table``.
        base: The face the table draws its body cells in today.
        header_rows: How many leading rows are drawn in a different face.
        header_base: The face those rows are drawn in; defaults to the bold
            Unicode face, which is what a header ``FONTNAME`` usually names.

    Returns:
        A possibly empty list of ``("FONTNAME", (col, row), (col, row), face)``.

# Register eagerly, at import time. Generators capture the face names with
# ``from app.core.pdf_fonts import BODY_FONT, BOLD_FONT``, which snapshots the
# string values at the moment of import. If registration only ran later (inside
# a generator), the Helvetica fallback - implemented by reassigning these module
# globals on failure - would never reach the names those modules already bound,
# so an install with the bundled TTFs missing would hand reportlab the
# unregistered "DejaVuSans" and raise instead of degrading gracefully. Running
# it here finalises BODY_FONT / BOLD_FONT before any importer can read them, and
# the _registered gate keeps every later call a no-op.
