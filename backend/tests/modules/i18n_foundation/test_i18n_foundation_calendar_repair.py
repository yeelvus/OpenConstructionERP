"""``v3303`` run against a real database, not just its decision rule.

The seed file fix reaches new installs only - ``seed.py`` returns early once
the table has rows - so the Saudi calendar shipped as ``[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`` stays
in every database that has already seeded. ``v3303_work_calendar_iso_weekdays``
is the repair, and ``tests/unit/test_work_calendar_weekdays_are_iso.py`` proves
its decision rule shape by shape without a database.

This is the other half: the statement actually running. A repair whose rule is
right and whose UPDATE writes the text ``"[7, 1, 2, 3, 4]"`` into a JSON column,
or fails to bind at all, is still a broken repair, and no amount of testing the
rule would say so.
