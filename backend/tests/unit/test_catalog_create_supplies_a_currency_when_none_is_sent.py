"""The catalogue must name a currency when the caller cannot.

The BOQ editor saves a resource into the user's own catalogue. It used to
rebuild the currency code from the display symbol, which recognised three
symbols and answered EUR for the rest, so a project in CLP, BRL, PLN or INR
wrote its catalogue rows in euros. It now sends the project's own ISO code, and
where the project never set one it omits the field entirely rather than sending
a blank string.

Omitting is only correct because this schema carries a default. Nothing further
down the path fills a currency in: ``create_resource`` passes ``data.currency``
straight to the column, and the column's own default applies only to an unset
attribute, not to an empty string. So an empty string would validate, store, and
leave a catalogue row that names no currency at all.

These tests pin the two halves of that: the default exists and is a usable code,
and a blank string is not equivalent to omitting the field.
