"""Wires scripts/check_validation_message_locale_coverage.py into the pytest run.

That script is the actual gate (it can be run by hand and prints its own
report); this file is what makes it fire on every ordinary backend test run
without a CI workflow edit. That is measured, not assumed: ci.yml's "Run unit
tests with pytest" step (grep the step name, the line number will drift) runs
``pytest tests/unit`` sharded six ways, directory-scoped, so a new file in this
directory is collected with no workflow change. Most of ci-postgres.yml names
individual files instead and would NOT have picked this up. Same relationship
test_backend_locale_catalogue.py has to backend/locales - except that guard
predates this one and covers a different catalogue (app.core.i18n's 28 backend
locales), not the seven MessageBundle catalogues under backend/app. Nothing
checked those before this file: not test_validation_i18n.py (per-key coverage
inside locales that already exist, never file count), not
test_backend_locale_catalogue.py (wrong directory), not any
scripts/check_i18n_*.py (all scoped to frontend/).

A gate that cannot go red is not a gate, so this exercises every failure path
directly rather than trusting that the script's logic is correct by inspection.
The locale-loss proof is parametrised over all six module catalogues rather
than sampling one: the gate was widened from one catalogue to seven, and a
proof that bcf is ratcheted says nothing about the other five.
