"""Feature 06 — submittal ↔ approval-routes wiring tests.

Pins the connective tissue:

1. ``SubmittalService.start_approval`` creates an ``Instance`` with
   ``target_kind='submittal'`` and moves the submittal out of draft, recording
   the instance id in metadata for deep-linking.
2. The engine's terminal decision events carry ``target_kind`` / ``target_id``
   / ``decided_by`` so a consumer subscriber can drive the FSM.
3. ``SubmittalService.apply_approval_decision`` (the body the subscriber calls)
   drives the existing, idempotent FSM: approve → ``approved`` (idempotent on a
   duplicate event), reject → ``rejected`` with the comment persisted.
4. The engine rejects a second pending workflow on the same submittal (409).
5. A project with NO configured route keeps the direct ``/approve`` path — the
   subscriber never fires because no instance exists.

These exercise the real service + engine objects on the same session, which is
how the feature behaves in production: ``start_approval`` and the FSM share the
request session, and the subscriber simply re-invokes
``apply_approval_decision`` from its own session on a committed row.

    The submittal FSM publishes ``submittal.submitted`` / ``.reviewed`` /
    ``.approved`` which, in the live app, fan out to the vector indexer and
    notifications — each opening its own ``async_session_factory`` session.
    conftest shims ``publish_detached`` to run synchronously, so those
    cross-session writes execute inline outside a greenlet and raise
    ``MissingGreenlet`` in the unit harness (they are detached + greenlet-safe
    in production). We snapshot the bus, clear the handler maps that matter to
    these tests, and restore on teardown so the suite stays hermetic. The
    feature's own wiring is exercised directly via the service methods the
    subscriber calls, so dropping the bus subscribers does not reduce
    coverage of the connective tissue under test.
