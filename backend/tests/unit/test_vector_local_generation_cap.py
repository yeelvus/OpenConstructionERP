"""Generating vectors locally must cover the catalogue, or say where it stopped.

When the pre-built embeddings cannot be fetched, this endpoint falls back to
generating them from the cost items already in the database. That fallback took
a fixed first slice - ``search(region=db_id, limit=5000)`` - and reported how
many rows it had indexed and nothing else. For any base bigger than the slice
the caller was handed a smaller, entirely plausible number, and the rest of the
catalogue was left out of the search index with nothing anywhere to say so. The
two values that would have said so, ``total`` and ``has_more``, came back from
the same call and were discarded on the spot.

A cap is still the right shape here, unlike on reads that merely buffer: every
row on this path goes through an embedding model inside the request, so removing
the ceiling would put unbounded CPU work on an open connection. What changes is
that the pass now walks the catalogue in pages up to that ceiling instead of
stopping at the first one, that the ceiling sits above every base the platform
ships so reaching it is an anomaly, and that reaching it is reported - with the
ceiling, how much was covered and how much there was.

The last two tests are the pair that matters. One puts a catalogue past the
ceiling and asserts the signal appears; the other puts one that ends exactly ON
the ceiling and asserts it does not, because a false alarm sends the reader
looking for rows that were never missing.

No database is involved: the repository is replaced by one that serves pages,
and the embedding model by a recorder.
