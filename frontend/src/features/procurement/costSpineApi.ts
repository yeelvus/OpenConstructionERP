/**
 * The project's cost spine, read so a buyer can order against a bill position.
 *
 * The buyer picks a position, not a cost line. What the picker actually lists
 * is the cost spine, because a spine line generated from the bill carries the
 * position's code, description, unit and estimate, and it is the set of
 * positions an order can be attributed to. A position with no spine line is
 * not offered, since ordering against it would record no money link at all.
 *
 * What goes back to the server is the `boq_position_id`, not the cost line, so
 * the link is resolved server-side at the moment the order line is written.
 * Sending the cost line we happen to be holding would freeze whatever this
 * page loaded, which may already be stale.
 * `backend/app/modules/procurement/cost_spine.py` sets out why.
 *
 * Narrowing happens on the server, not here. A bill can run to thousands of
 * positions and the endpoint serves at most two hundred at a time, so a filter
 * that could only see what had been loaded would answer "no such position" for
 * a position the register holds, which is a worse answer than an error. The
 * three parameters below exist for that: `search` reaches the whole bill,
 * `linked_to_position` makes the returned rows and their count describe the
 * same set, and `boq_position_id` resolves a selection that sorts past the
 * page so an already attributed line can still be named.
 *
 * The one thing that stays partial is the unsearched list, which is a page of
 * a possibly longer register. `truncated` says so, and the picker prints it.
