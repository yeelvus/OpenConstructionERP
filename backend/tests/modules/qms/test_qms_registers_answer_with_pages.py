"""The quality registers have to say how much of themselves they returned.

Every one of these routes capped its result and answered with a bare array,
so a project past the cap was handed a full page with nothing to say it was
one. The NCR register is the sharp end: a project is closed out against its
list of nonconformities, and a list that stops at 200 and reads as complete
is how one survives handover.

Asserted against the registered ``response_model`` rather than the return
annotation. ``router.py`` imports annotations from ``__future__``, so the
annotation is the string "NCRListResponse" and an identity check against it
would pass for any module that spells a name the same way. ``response_model``
is also what FastAPI serialises through, so a route could declare the
envelope in one and rows in the other and only this half would reach a
reader.

No database and no HTTP: this is a claim about what the router declares, and
routing tables are built at import. Every route is looked up by its endpoint
function rather than by path, so renaming a path cannot quietly drop a case
here to zero matches and still pass.
