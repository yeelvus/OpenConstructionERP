"""What still points at a document, so a delete can say what it costs.

Thirty-four columns across twenty-one modules hold a document id that no
foreign key constrains. ``delete_document`` removes the row unconditionally:
it never asks whether anything still points at the id, and the three
subscribers of ``documents.document.deleted`` (the module's own handler, the
file_search indexer, the file_references purger) own none of these columns.
So the ids are left behind, and the user confirming the delete is told
nothing about them.

This module is the read-only half of the answer: it names the referrers and
counts them. It changes no delete behaviour. Blocking the delete would be the
wrong call, and the codebase says so itself - ``CloseoutBinding`` documents
its soft link as deliberate "so deleting a document never cascade-wipes the
closeout history". The references are meant to be severable. They are just
not meant to be invisible.

Why the list is curated rather than discovered
----------------------------------------------
Matching column names at runtime finds the same thirty-four, and that
agreement is what the gate in ``tests/unit/test_document_reference_integrity``
checks. It is not safe as the source of truth, because in this codebase a
column called ``document_id`` does not always mean a document:

* ``EInvoiceEvent.document_id`` carries a ForeignKey to
  ``oe_einvoice_clearance_document`` - a different table entirely. It is
  excluded here only because it has that key; a name-matcher would have
  swallowed it.
* ``PortalDocumentAccessLog.document_id`` is polymorphic. It is qualified by
  ``document_type``, a free-form ``String(64)`` the API accepts from the
  caller, and only the value ``document`` means a documents-module row. Hence
  ``qualifier`` below.

Impact vocabulary
-----------------
``strands``
    The column is NOT NULL, so the row cannot even record that the document
    went away. It is left pointing at nothing and no repair short of deleting
    the row can fix it. Six columns are in this state.
``unlinks``
    The column is nullable, or the id sits in a JSON array an element can be
    dropped from. The row survives and loses its attachment.
``retains``
    The row is meant to outlive the document. The portal access log is
    append-only audit, and takeoff already holds its own copy of the blob:
    ``preserve_blobs_for_deleted_source`` runs inline in the delete path
    precisely so the takeoff document keeps working.

Impacts are read off the model and its comments, never off the column name.
