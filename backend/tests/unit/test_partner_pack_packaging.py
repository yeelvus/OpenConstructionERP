"""The documents a pack ships in the repository, and the ones it ships to a user.

Thirteen packs carried rule-pack documents in the tree that no installed copy
ever received, because a wheel only carries a non-Python file when a
``package-data`` glob names it. The defect is invisible from inside the tree:
every document is there, every test that reads the tree finds it, and the only
people affected are the ones who installed from a package. That is the worst
shape a defect can have, so it gets a gate rather than a repair.

The property is stated over every pack: each non-Python file under a pack's
package directory has to be matched by one of that package's ``package-data``
globs. A pack that starts shipping a new data directory without declaring it
goes red on the day it lands, not on the day somebody installs it.

The inverse, a glob that matches nothing, is deliberately not asserted here.
Twelve packs carry one today and it costs nothing: setuptools ignores a glob
with no files, so the wheel is correct either way. Folding it in would make
this gate red for a cosmetic reason and train people to ignore it, which is how
a gate stops working.

``test_the_gate_reports_a_pack_whose_glob_is_missing`` is the part that keeps
this honest. A gate built from first principles can pass because its own
predicate is wrong, so the predicate is run against a pack built to fail and
against the same pack built to pass, and has to tell them apart.
