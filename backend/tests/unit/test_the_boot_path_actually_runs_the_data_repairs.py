"""The runner is wired into startup, in the right branch and in the right order.

``tests/pg/test_data_repairs.py`` proves the runner does the right thing when it
is called. Nothing there proves that anything calls it. That gap is not a
theoretical one: the defect the whole data-repair mechanism exists to answer is
code that does nothing while every signal reports success, and a call site
deleted from ``app/main.py`` would reproduce it exactly - the module would still
import, the health field would still answer ``false`` because
``data_repairs_failed`` is only set where the pass runs, and no test would move.

Read statically off ``app/main.py`` rather than by booting a lifespan. Booting
one needs a live PostgreSQL and belongs to the PG lane; what has to be held here
is a property of the source, and three of the four assertions below are about
ORDER, which a runtime test would find harder to see than the parser does.

The three orderings, and why each matters:

* the ledger model is imported before ``create_all``. It is declared in
  ``app.core``, which the dynamic ``app.modules.*`` model loop never reaches, so
  an import that lands after ``create_all`` leaves the table absent - the
  repairs then run correctly and the record of them is lost on every install.
* the repairs run after ``create_all``, because the ledger they write to is one
  of the tables ``create_all`` builds.
* both sit inside the ``"postgresql" in settings.database_url`` branch, which is
  what makes ``data_repairs_failed`` answer ``null`` rather than ``false`` on a
  deployment that never runs them.
