"""A purchase order has to read back the position it was ordered against.

``POItemCreate`` accepts a ``boq_position_id``, the buyer picks one, and the
order stores only the cost line it resolved to, because a money row carries no
position column. That is the right storage decision and it left a hole on the
read side: the response returned the cost line and nothing else, so an edit
form reopening the order had no way to put the buyer's own choice back into
the picker. The control renders empty, empty looks like "never coded", and the
next save writes it back over a real attribution.

So the response now carries the position too, derived rather than stored.
These tests cover both halves of that: the query that resolves it, and the
stamping that puts it on the response.

The negative cases are the point. A line with no cost link, and a cost line
generated from no position, both have to come back as ``None`` rather than as
somebody else's position, because the map is keyed by cost line and a wrong
key silently reads as a missing one.
