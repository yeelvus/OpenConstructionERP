# DDC-CWICR-OE: DataDrivenConstruction - OpenConstructionERP
"""The cost-side demo seeds must fill their screens, and fill them only once.

Allowances, the basis of estimate and the value dashboard all shipped with no
demo data at all, so every demo project photographed as an empty state. The
three seeders that fix that share the ways a demo seed goes wrong without
raising anything:

* the register is populated but incoherent - a drawdown larger than the
  allowance it draws against, a document whose coverage does not match the
  estimate it was derived from. Nobody reading a screenshot checks the
  arithmetic, and everybody reading the register does;
* the second boot doubles it, because idempotency in this codebase is per loop
  rather than per seeder;
* the rows exist but the reader downstream cannot use them. The value figures
  are aggregated by the pure engines, so rows that land outside the project
  scope, or on one instant, aggregate to a headline of zero or to a single bar
  with no error anywhere;
* the seed runs on a project that is not a demo project. The boot enrichment
  hands every project in the database to every seeder, so on a real installation
  a customer's own project is offered to all three. Being idempotent does not
  help there - it is the first run that does the damage.

The third is asserted through the value service's own aggregation rather than by
restating its ``WHERE`` clause, so a change to what the dashboard counts fails
here.
