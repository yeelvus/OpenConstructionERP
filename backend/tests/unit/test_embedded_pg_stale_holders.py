"""A holder that was killed must not stop the next process from stopping the cluster.

``pixeltable-pgserver`` records one process identifier per process that opens
the embedded cluster and stops the postmaster on the way out only when the list
it reads back names the exiting process and nothing else. It appends on the way
in and edits on the way out, so a holder that was killed never removes itself,
and nothing in the library prunes what is left.

Until this release the only way this application stopped on Windows was by
ending its process tree, so every machine that has already run it carries
identifiers of processes that no longer exist. That makes the graceful stop a
one-time event: it can fire on a data directory nobody has ever force-killed
and is skipped on every machine it was actually written for. It is skipped
silently, too, because from outside a skipped stop and a completed one look the
same, which is why this is a test and not an observation.

Deciding which recorded holders are gone rests on ``_pid_alive``, so the second
half of this file pins that down as well, in particular that it keeps answering
without ``psutil``. psutil is not a declared dependency of this project, and a
liveness check that quietly stops checking disarms the whole thing.

The live and dead identifiers here are real processes this test starts, rather
than numbers assumed to be free. The stand-in server implements the library's
decision rather than a paraphrase of it, and the last test fails if a future
version of the library changes that decision.
