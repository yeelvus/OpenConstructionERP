"""Per-folder permission ORM models for the file-manager.

Tables:
    oe_documents_folder_permission - grants a project member ``viewer``,
                                     ``editor``, or ``owner`` access to a
                                     specific ``(scope_kind, scope_path)``
                                     folder within a project.

Semantics
---------
A "folder" here is a virtual concept: it is identified by a
:class:`FileKind`-style key (``bim_model``, ``dwg_drawing``, ``sheet``,
``photo``, ``document``, …) optionally narrowed by a ``scope_path``
sub-path. ``scope_path = NULL`` means "all files of this kind". A
non-null ``scope_path`` lets the owner restrict sub-paths
(e.g. ``photo`` kind, path ``site/2026-05`` → only the May 2026 site
photos).

Access logic (enforced in :mod:`folder_permissions_service`):

* Project owner → bypass entirely (existing repository behaviour).
* Project member with NO matching grant on a scoped folder → 404.
* Project member with a matching grant → role determines write capability:

  =======  =====================  =========================
  Role     Read (list / get)      Write (upload / delete)
  =======  =====================  =========================
  viewer   yes                    no
  editor   yes                    upload + delete OWN files
  owner    yes                    full
  =======  =====================  =========================

* Folders that have **no grants at all** stay open to every project
  member - keeps the default UX (Team Strip) backward compatible.

Why a soft-delete column instead of ``DELETE``?
    Revoking is a frequent operation and we want it to be an atomic
    flip. Hard-deleting would also lose the audit trail of who had
    access when. A future ``GET /folder-permissions/audit/`` endpoint
    can replay history off the same table.

Why ``UniqueConstraint(project_id, scope_kind, scope_path, user_id)``?
    Prevents a user accumulating multiple conflicting roles on the
    same scope (one user, one role per folder). On re-grant the
    router maps the unique violation to **409 Conflict** so the UI
    can surface a useful message instead of a generic 500.
