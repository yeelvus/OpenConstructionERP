"""The reconciler has to have an opinion about every rate the seed file ships.

Why this file exists at all
---------------------------
``tax_seed_reconcile`` splits the shipped rate lines three ways: lines added
after the file's first release, which it may deliver; lines another repair
owns, which it must not touch; and everything else, which is what dates a
database's seed.

The third group is derived rather than written out, and that is the hazard. A
line added to ``tax_configurations.json`` without a matching entry in
``LINE_FIRST_SHIPPED`` falls silently into it, where it does two wrong things
at once: it is never delivered to anybody, which is the original defect coming
straight back for that rate, and it becomes evidence about when a database was
seeded, which it cannot be, because the installs being dated are exactly the
ones that do not have it.

Nothing else would notice. The repair still runs, still reports clean, and the
rate is simply absent on every upgraded install - which is the failure mode the
whole registry exists because of. So the seed file is pinned here, and adding a
row to it is meant to fail this test and make somebody say which release the
row first shipped in.
