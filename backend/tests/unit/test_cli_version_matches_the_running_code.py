"""The version the CLI prints is the version the server reports.

``_resolve_version`` used to ask ``importlib.metadata`` first, which returns
whatever distribution is installed in the environment. On a source checkout
that had ever seen ``pip install openconstructionerp``, that is not the code
being executed: the CLI printed v15.2.0 for a tree at 15.9.1 while
``/api/health`` on the same interpreter correctly said 15.9.1, and there was no
test to notice. ``config._detect_version`` exists precisely to prefer the
pyproject beside the running source, and its own docstring says why: otherwise
you cannot tell, in a QA session, whether a just-edited file is serving
requests.

None of this is a fact about the environment these tests happen to run in, so
the checks below construct the disagreement rather than waiting for one.
