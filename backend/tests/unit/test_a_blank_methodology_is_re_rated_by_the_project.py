"""What a hand-made methodology is priced at, against what it says on screen.

A methodology installed from the catalogue carries its country's rate, and the
project VAT override lands on a number the reader recognises. A methodology the
user made by hand is the sharper case, and it is the one this file pins.

``CreateMethodologyModal.tsx`` seeds a new methodology with exactly one cascade
step, ``category="tax"``, ``rate="0"``, and sends ``vat_rate="0"`` beside it.
Exactly one tax step is precisely the condition
:meth:`MethodologyService._with_project_vat` requires, so that nought is
replaced by the project's own rate at pricing time. The computed figures and
both exports are right to do this, and they report the rate they used. The read
side does not: ``GET /methodologies/{id}`` serves the stored steps and the
stored ``vat_rate``, so a screen showing VAT nought belongs to a bill costed at
the project's rate, with nothing on the screen saying so.

This file characterises that behaviour rather than blessing it. Whether the
read side should carry an override signal, resolve the effective rate, or ask
the user before substituting at all is an open product question. What is not
open is that the substitution happens on the hand-made stack too, which is easy
to miss because every catalogue template arrives with a plausible rate already
in place and only the blank one starts at nought.
