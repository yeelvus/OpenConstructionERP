"""The three answers ``scripts/inspect_desktop_sidecar_signatures.py`` can give.

The census is a release gate: it reads the Mach-O members sealed inside the onefile
sidecar and fails the build when one of them disagrees with the wrapper about a Team ID.
A gate is only worth its exit code, and this one used to spend 0 on two unrelated states.
On a runner that is not macOS it returned 0 without opening the file, and the workflow
step that reads that 0 writes the word "clean" into the job summary. So "there is no
codesign here to ask" and "every member agrees with the wrapper" arrived at a human
reader as the same sentence.

What keeps that from being live today is a condition at the call site, not the script:
both invocations in ``desktop-release.yml`` are closed by ``runner.os == 'macOS'``. A
third one added without it would produce a cleared census over an artifact nobody opened.
That is the same silhouette as a build-output test that passes because the build output
is absent, and it is why the answer belongs in the script.

So the codes are asserted exactly, never as ``!= 0``. ``!= 0`` passes on 1 as readily as
on 2, which is the collapse this file exists to detect one number over.

Cases:
    * the platform is wrong, the file is there - exit 2, and no census line to misread
    * the file is missing - exit 1, on macOS and off it, because existence is asked first
    * a darwin run over agreeing members - exit 0 and a census line with a real count
    * a darwin run over a disagreeing member under the gate flag - exit 1
    * the three states do not share an exit code
    * no PyInstaller to open the archive with - exit 2, not an accusation about members
    * a reader that refuses the file itself - exit 1, because that is about the file
