"""What the ISO-zero repair will and will not touch.

The whole safety of the repair is in one decision - repair this row, or leave
it - and that decision is a pure function, so it is tested here without a
database. The database half is in ``tests/pg/test_work_calendar_iso_zero.py``.

The case that matters most is the one that must NOT be touched: a four-day
Monday-to-Thursday week is unusual and entirely legal on this axis, and a repair
that cannot tell it from a week written on the wrong axis would be rewriting
somebody's deliberate configuration. Unusual is not impossible, and only the
impossible one is repaired.
