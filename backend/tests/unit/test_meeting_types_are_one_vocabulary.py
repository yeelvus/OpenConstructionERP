"""What the meetings module does with its type list, beyond agreeing on it.

The cross-layer agreement, that the Python tuple, the TypeScript array and the
locale files all say the same words, is held for every module at once in
``test_module_vocabularies_close_across_layers.py``. What lives here is the
part only this module has: a meeting type can be guessed from a transcript, and
a type nothing can guess is a type the import path can never offer. That is not
a crash, it is an option in the API that no feature ever produces.
