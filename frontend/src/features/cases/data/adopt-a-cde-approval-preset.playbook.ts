// Case: "Adopt a CDE approval preset".
//
// A short, focused worked example for the CDE setup wizard and the
// ready-made ISO 19650 approval presets: run the wizard, adopt a preset in
// one click, tailor the cloned route, then confirm the go-live gate is
// actually satisfied before the whole team is invited on.
