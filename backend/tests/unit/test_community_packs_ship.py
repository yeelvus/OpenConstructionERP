"""The community packs have to be packaged, and then they have to be findable.

Nineteen packs sat in the repository and no pip or desktop install had ever
listed one. Two independent defects, either of which alone was enough:

1. ``backend/pyproject.toml`` packaged ``app`` and ``openconstructionerp`` and
   nothing else, so the ``packs/`` tree never entered the wheel.
2. ``app/core/partner_pack/discovery.py`` located the tree by counting five
   parent directories up from its own file. That reaches the repo root in a
   source checkout and the virtualenv's ``Lib`` directory in an install, where
   nothing has ever existed.

Each defect hid the other. Fixing the packaging alone ships bytes nothing
looks at; fixing the resolution alone points at a directory that was never
shipped. So this file checks both halves, and checks them the way the bug
demanded: the resolution half is exercised against a synthetic *installed*
layout, because a check that only ever runs in the source tree is precisely
the blindness that let this survive.

What is deliberately not here: proof that a built wheel contains the files.
Configuration that looks right can still produce an archive that does not, so
that assertion belongs on the artefact and lives in the wheel-inspection step
of ``.github/workflows/pypi-publish.yml``.

Pure filesystem and AST work, no database and no application import beyond the
discovery module itself, so nothing here can be skipped by a database marker.
