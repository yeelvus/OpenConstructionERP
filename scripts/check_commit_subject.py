"""Commit subject guard: reject a shell quoting artefact in the subject line.

Twelve commits in this history open with ``@ `` before their real subject,
among them the v14.6.0 release commit. None of that was intended. A PowerShell
here-string opener (``@'``) written on the same line as ``git commit -m`` is
consumed as the start of the message, so git takes it as the subject and the
sentence the author wrote lands underneath it. The message reads fine in the
editor and wrong in ``git log``, and nothing between the two says so.

The rule this guards is narrow on purpose. It does not ask a subject to be a
conventional commit: several hundred subjects in this history are not, and
retrofitting that is a separate decision. It asks only that the subject not be
a fragment of the shell that produced it, which is never a style preference and
always a corrupted message.

Two rules, deliberately scoped differently:

  * The artefact rule runs in every mode. The twelve commits that already carry
    it are published and one of them is the target of the v14.6.0 tag, so they
    are listed below as history that cannot be rewritten rather than treated as
    failures.
  * The dash rule runs only on a message being written. Long dashes are against
    project style, but 2094 existing messages use one, so a scan of history
    would report a decision nobody has taken rather than a defect.

Three ways to run it, matching check_commit_trailers.py:

    python scripts/check_commit_subject.py                # all commits from HEAD (CI)
    python scripts/check_commit_subject.py --range A..B   # a revision range
    python scripts/check_commit_subject.py <msgfile>      # one message file (commit-msg hook)

Exit code 0 means clean. Exit code 1 lists every offending commit.
