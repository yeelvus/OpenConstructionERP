"""Report modules that reach an inference primitive without declaring that they do.

The question this exists to answer is the first one a regulator or a buyer asks:
which of the things you ship performs inference, and on what. Today that can only
be answered by a person reading every module and forming an opinion, which is how
a sweep of this platform's AI surface finished without having opened the module
that transcribes speech.

`ModuleManifest.inference` lets a module answer for itself. This gate checks the
answers against the code, because a register nobody checks is a register that
drifts, and it is quoted outside the project.

WHY THIS IS NOT SCOPED BY NAME

A gate keyed on directory names passes `phonelog` in silence. That is not a
hypothetical: `phonelog` is a filing-sounding name on a module that posts call
audio to a hosted speech-to-text endpoint, and a keyword sweep of this tree
missed it for exactly that reason. Names are also wrong in the other direction -
`smart_views` sounds like inference and is a pure rule engine with hard-coded
predicates, and `bimlv` sounds like nothing at all.

So the scope is what a module actually reaches. Every import in `backend/app` is
read with `ast` and resolved into a graph, and a module is in scope when it, or
anything it imports without leaving `app/core`, imports one of the PRIMITIVES
below.

WHY THE WALK STOPS AT ANOTHER MODULE'S BOUNDARY

Following every import edge without limit puts 56 of 193 modules in scope, and
most of that is one module calling another module's public service function that
happens to run a model inside. Measured on 2026-08-28: 31 modules reach a
primitive on their own account, and 25 more only through another module. Those 25
are consuming somebody else's inference, and the producer is the one carrying the
obligation, so lumping them together produces a number nobody can act on. The
walk therefore goes freely through `app/core` and stops at the boundary of
another `app/modules/<other>`.

A module that consumes another's inference is not off the hook, it is a different
answer: `InferenceRole.CONSUMES_RESULT`, which this gate does not require but
does check for completeness when it is given.

WHY A MODULE MAY DECLARE MORE THAN ONCE

One answer per module is the wrong shape for at least one endpoint here. The
catalogue matcher scores with a rapidfuzz ratio and two fixed bonuses in lexical
mode, which is a predefined string rule, and with a learned encoder in semantic
and hybrid mode, and the mode arrives as a request parameter with lexical as the
default. A single role would be wrong for most of that endpoint's calls. So the
manifest may carry a tuple, each entry saying in `when` which calls it covers,
and this gate treats a module as declared when any entry admits inference and as
contradicted only when every entry denies it.

The rules for what makes a declaration too thin exist twice: once on the objects,
in InferenceDeclaration.gaps and ModuleManifest.inference_gaps, and once here in
the ast loop. That is the price of a gate that refuses to import manifests, which
it refuses so that a manifest cannot change the answer by running code. Edit one
and edit the other, because the two drifting apart makes the register wrong
rather than merely noisy.

WHAT A GRAPH ROOTED AT PRIMITIVES CANNOT FIND

A model loaded in place, reaching no shared entry point at all. Two exist today:
`erp_chat/service.py` posts to two provider endpoints with its own HTTP client
rather than through the shared layer, and `costs/matcher.py` constructs a
sentence-transformer itself when the shared embedder is unavailable. Both modules
happen to be in scope for other reasons, so neither is currently hidden by this -
but the shape is, so a second textual pass runs alongside the graph and reports
separately. It is a text instrument, so it reads a hostname in a comment the same
way it reads one in a call, and every member of its list has been opened and read.
Modules that host a primitive are excluded from it: the graph starts at those
files, so naming them as what the graph cannot see is simply untrue.

WHAT THIS GATE DOES NOT SEE AT ALL

`ModuleLoader.discover()` walks the shipped directory plus any runtime root
attached by `module_runtime_root`. This gate walks the shipped directory only, so
a module written by the module builder and installed at runtime is outside its
population entirely. That is exactly the Article 25 case - a user who modifies the
intended purpose becomes the provider - so the omission is worth knowing rather
than worth quietly closing here: the honest place to catch it is the builder,
which now writes a declaration into every module it generates.

Run from anywhere:

    python scripts/check_module_inference_declarations.py

It reports and exits 0 by design, so that the number can be read before anything
starts failing a build on it. `--strict` turns findings into a non-zero exit.
An optional path argument scans a different app directory instead, which is what
the negative-control test uses so it never has to write into the live tree:
