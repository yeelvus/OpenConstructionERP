"""The last rung of the display-title chain may not be a bare identifier.

:class:`VectorHit` resolves a title from the stored payload, then from the
embedded text, and finally from the row id. Both frontend consumers of the
unified search render that title as the row label, and one of them does so
with no guard of its own, so the last rung put thirty six characters of
hexadecimal in front of the reader. An identifier names nothing to a person
and cannot be told apart from the next unnamed row.

The assertions below compare the title against the id rather than merely
requiring one. A UUID is a non-empty string, so a check that only asked for a
truthy title would pass against exactly the output being fixed here.

No database is involved: ``VectorHit`` is a dataclass with a property.
