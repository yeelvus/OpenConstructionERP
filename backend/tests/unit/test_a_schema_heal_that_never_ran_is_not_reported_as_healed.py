"""A verdict about work that never happened is not "it went fine".

``/api/health`` reports ``schema_heal_failed``, and it computed it as a plain
two-valued boolean: false unless a failure was recorded. The heal that would
record one runs inside ``if "postgresql" in settings.database_url`` in the
startup sequence, so a deployment whose database is not PostgreSQL never reaches
it and answered ``false`` for its whole life - "healed fine" about a heal that
never happened, which is not what that deployment knows.

Three states are needed and there are three: healed, failed, never ran. This is
the same argument the field one line above it already makes -
``alembic_head_matches`` answers ``null`` where the comparison cannot be made,
because a permanent wrong answer is worse than no answer, and consumers act on
it. See ``test_an_undeterminable_migration_head_reads_as_unknown.py``.

The polarity is inverted between the two fields, which is why the endpoint reads
this one with ``is True``: for the head check ``false`` is the bad news, here
``true`` is. ``null`` is not bad news in either and must not degrade the status.

The verdict also belongs to the application it describes rather than to the
process. It used to live in a module global, so a second ``create_app()`` in one
interpreter - which the test suite does routinely, and a desktop process that
restarts its backend in place could - inherited the first application's verdict
about a database it never opened.
