"""Repo hygiene guard: keep internal-only files out of the repo and builds.

Internal planning docs, strategy, QA artifacts, audits and runbooks are kept
local only. They must never ship in the public repository or in a release
artifact (the wheel, the frontend bundle, an installer). This guard fails the
commit, the CI run, or the build if any tracked file, or any file inside a
built artifact, matches the internal denylist below.

Usage:
    python scripts/check_repo_hygiene.py              # scan git-tracked files
    python scripts/check_repo_hygiene.py --zip X.whl  # scan a wheel / zip
    python scripts/check_repo_hygiene.py --dir DIR    # scan a directory tree

Exit code 0 means clean. Exit code 1 means an internal-only path was found and
the output names every offending file.

# --- The untracked-file check -------------------------------------------------
#
# The denylist above matches names, so it only ever catches a leak somebody
# already thought of. It passed clean on a wheel carrying
# app/scripts/demo_seed_issues.md, an internal defect log with BLOCKER and BUG
# entries, because that name is neither underscore-prefixed nor all-caps and no
# pattern described it. Two seed scripts and a stale 495-entry frontend bundle
# rode in beside it. All four were in .gitignore; the ignore lines were written
# repo-root-anchored as ``backend/...`` while hatchling resolves patterns
# against the project root, which is ``backend/``, so it looked for them at
# ``backend/backend/...`` and every one of the 43 such lines was inert.
#
# Adding four more names would leave the class open. The structural question is
# the one below: a wheel should contain built artifacts and tracked sources, so
# a file in the archive that git does not track is the shape of the whole bug,
# whatever it happens to be called and whichever ignore file failed to stop it.
#
# Archive paths are mapped back to repo paths using the build's own
# configuration, read from backend/pyproject.toml, rather than a table copied
# by hand: ``packages`` and the ``force-include`` map are exactly the statement
# of where each part of the wheel came from. An archive path that matches no
# entry in that map is reported, not skipped. That is deliberate. If someone
# adds a force-include and does not extend the map, the right failure is this
# gate crying about paths it cannot explain, because the alternative is the
# gate going quiet, which is how the original hole stayed open.

# Sources that are legitimately untracked, with the reason each one is allowed.
# Keyed by the repo-relative source path the build reads them from, so the
# allowance is stated about the real directory rather than about wherever the
# wheel happens to file it. Argue with these; do not add to them lightly. The
# test for a new entry is "this is generated by the build" and not "this is
# untracked on my machine", which is what the leaked files would have claimed.
