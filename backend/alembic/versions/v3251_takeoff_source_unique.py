"""Takeoff from-source idempotency: collapse duplicates, add unique index.

``POST /documents/from-source`` find-or-creates a takeoff document by
``(project_id, source_document_id)`` with an unlocked SELECT then INSERT, so two
concurrent opens of the same Project-Files PDF could both miss and both insert,
minting duplicate ``oe_takeoff_document`` rows for one source. Measurements and
AI plan-read runs reference the document by its string id, so a reader that
resolved to a different duplicate than a measurement was saved against saw the
measurement disappear - stranded on an unreachable row (issue #369).

This migration first merges any pre-existing duplicates - keep the oldest row
per ``(project_id, source_document_id)`` group as canonical, re-point its
measurements and AI runs, delete the newer duplicates and remove their orphaned
PDF files - then adds the unique index that prevents new ones. The merge has to
run before the index or the ``CREATE UNIQUE INDEX`` fails on the existing
duplicates.

A plain (non-partial) unique index is used on purpose: ``source_document_id`` is
NULL for direct uploads and PostgreSQL treats NULLs as distinct in a unique
index, so ordinary uploads never collide, and a plain index (unlike a partial
one) is also reconstructed by the startup ``postgres_auto_migrate`` heal on
embedded / stamped installs that never run this migration.

Every step is inspector-guarded and idempotent, so a re-run - or a database the
embedded runtime already healed - is a no-op. PostgreSQL-only. Chained after
v3250_merge_open_heads to keep a single linear head.
