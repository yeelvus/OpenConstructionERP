"""Changelog mirror guard: the file and the in-app page must tell the same story.

This project keeps two changelogs. ``CHANGELOG.md`` at the repo root carries the
prose, and ``frontend/src/features/about/Changelog.tsx`` carries a trimmed card
per release for the /about page. They are written by hand, separately, and until
this script nothing compared them.

``scripts/check_version_sync.py`` reads the top of each, but only to answer a
different question: does the newest entry match ``backend/pyproject.toml``. That
check is silent in exactly the case that matters here. It compares each file
against the version literal, never against the other file, so when a release is
written into one changelog and forgotten in the other, the release simply is not
mentioned and there is no drift for a version comparison to see. The gap is not
hypothetical: twelve commits landed after 17.7.1 with no ``[Unreleased]`` section
in either file, and every gate in the tree stayed green over it.

What this reads:

  * every ``## [N.N.N]`` heading in the markdown, and whether it opens with an
    ``## [Unreleased]`` section
  * every ``version: '...'`` literal in the component, split into release
    numbers and the single ``Unreleased`` label the component allows

What it fails on:

  * the newest release in the markdown is absent from the component
  * the newest release in the component is absent from the markdown
  * any release at or above FULL_COMPARISON_FLOOR that appears in one file and
    not the other, in either direction
  * one side carries an unreleased section and the other does not
  * either side carries no releases at all, which means the reader below broke
    rather than the changelogs agreeing about nothing
  * the component carries a version literal that is neither a release number nor
    the unreleased label, because a third kind would be counted by nothing here
    and read as a release by the version gate

The newest-release check and the full-set check are both kept, and they are not
redundant. The newest one carries the message a reader needs after an upgrade
and fires even for a release below the floor; the set one catches a hole in the
middle of the history that a matching head would hide. When the newest release
is itself the missing one, only the newest message is printed, so the same fact
is not reported twice under two headings.

Newest means the highest version, not the topmost line. The component sorts
semver-aware at render time precisely so an entry written out of order still
displays correctly, so the topmost literal there is a convention rather than a
guarantee, and a guard that assumed otherwise would report the wrong pair of
names in its own failure message.

Exit codes:
    0  - both changelogs name the same newest release and agree about whether
         there is unreleased work
    1  - they drift, or either file cannot be read

#     from 16.0.0   markdown  26   page  26   md-only   0   page-only  0
#
# Read those rows before changing the number. The gap is NOT a trimmed tail: the
# page carries 0.1.0, the oldest release in the markdown, and nothing at all is
# missing below it. All 116 markdown-only versions sit scattered INSIDE the range
# the page claims to cover, and it runs both ways, because 26 versions appear in
# the product page that the markdown has no record of. Those 26 were checked
# against git tags and the answer split: 12 of the 26 have a real tag and 14 do
# not, so the tags are a third record that agrees fully with neither file.
#
# Three disagreeing records of a four-year history is archaeology. Nobody should
# backfill it by guessing, because an entry invented to make this guard green is
# worse than the gap it closes: it reads as history and is not.
#
# What the rows do show is that from 10.0.0 onward the two files have agreed for
# 101 consecutive releases. Current practice is clean and has been for a long
# time; what is broken is a period before the practice settled. So the floor
# fences off the archaeology and lets the guard hold the part of the history that
# is actually maintained.
#
# Raising this number is always safe: it can only narrow what is compared.
# LOWERING it is not, and the cliff is closer than the number suggests. The
# highest divergence on either side is 6.1.2 (markdown-only), so a floor at
# 6.2.0 still passes today and anything at or below 6.1.2 goes red immediately
# on history that cannot be fixed. 10.0.0 is deliberately four minor series
# clear of that edge rather than hugging it, so a release series added below the
# current head does not quietly reopen the archaeology.
