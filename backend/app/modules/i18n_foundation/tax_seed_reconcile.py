"""Hand an already-seeded database the tax rates a later release added.

The defect
----------
``seed.py`` fills ``oe_i18n_tax_config`` only while the table is empty. A rate
added to ``seed_data/tax_configurations.json`` in a later release therefore
never reaches a database that was seeded before it, and no amount of shipping
the corrected file changes that. The file has grown from 70 rows to 81, and the
growth is not cosmetic: eight of the eleven were Canadian provincial rates. An
install seeded before v15.5.0 holds two of the ten sub-national Canadian rows
and gets ``subdivision_unknown`` from
:func:`~app.modules.i18n_foundation.tax_rules.resolve` for the other eight
provinces for the rest of its life, so a Canadian firm on such an install is
quietly missing most of its own provincial rates.

``romania_vat_2025`` is one hand-written instance of this, for one country. This
is the general case for the table.

The question this module is really about
----------------------------------------
Inserting a missing row is trivial. Knowing that it is missing rather than
deleted is not, and getting it wrong is far worse than the defect: a rate the
customer deliberately removed would come back on every boot, for ever, and
nothing they can do inside the product would stop it.

A row that is not on file looks exactly the same in both cases. So the answer
cannot come from looking at the table, and it comes from two places instead.

**One: what this repair has already handed over.** Every delivery is recorded
in :class:`~app.core.data_repairs.DataRepairDelivery`, in the same transaction
as the insert. From the second boot onward the question is settled by a record
rather than by inference - a key that was delivered is never delivered again,
whether or not the row is still there. Deleting a rate this repair gave you is
therefore permanent, which is the property that matters.

**Two: how old this database's seed is.** That is the only thing available on
the first boot, and here it is not a guess, because the seeder is
all-or-nothing. Every shipped row on an install was written by one seed
transaction over an empty table, so they all carry one ``created_at``, and that
timestamp says which seed file this install was built from. If the install was
seeded before the release that added a rate, the file it was seeded from did
not contain that rate, so it was never delivered. That is a proof rather than a
heuristic, and it is the reason this module can exist at all.

The residual gaps, stated rather than glossed
---------------------------------------------
Both are misses, never resurrections, and that asymmetry is deliberate: every
uncertainty resolves to "leave it alone".

* A database that still holds rows, but none of the originally seeded ones, has
  no timestamp to read, so nothing is delivered to it. Logged, and it stays
  broken until somebody adds the rates by hand.

  A table emptied completely is a different database and not a gap at all.
  ``_seed_tax_configurations`` fills this table whenever it is empty, so an
  empty table means the rows are about to be written rather than that they are
  missing - and on a first boot that is the ordinary state when this runs,
  because the repair registry runs well ahead of ``seed_i18n_data`` in
  ``app.main``. This repair is for an already-seeded database and declines to
  say anything about one it can see has not been seeded, silently: the sentence
  above, printed to somebody five minutes into their first install, tells them
  to do by hand what the boot is about to do for them.
* A fresh install of an OLD build, made after the rate shipped, reads as too
  young and is skipped. Rare - it needs somebody to install a superseded
  release for the first time - and the cost is that a fix does not arrive,
  which is where this module started.
* A database that filled the gap itself keeps its own rate and is given
  nothing. See below; that one is refused rather than merely missed.

Additive on the table is not additive on the answer
---------------------------------------------------
The population this repair serves is the one whose provinces have had no rate
for a year, so some of them will have typed the rate in themselves, under their
own tax code. Their row and ours are different rate lines, so the line is
absent, so on the reading above the rate is owed - and delivering it would be a
second rate charged on the same province, or a second country-wide rate with
nothing to say which of the two is the standard one, which is a country that
stops pricing at all rather than one that prices wrongly.

So the unit of absence is the rate line but the unit of delivery is the
jurisdiction: a line is only handed over into a province, or a country-wide
slot, that holds nothing in force today. That is a decision about whether to
write rather than a second kind of write, so the repair stays additive.

A refusal is logged and no delivery is recorded, because the line is still
owed. If the collision is ever cleared the next boot delivers it.

Delivered a rate at a time, not a row at a time
-----------------------------------------------
The unit is ``(country_code, tax_code)``, a rate line rather than one row of
one, and both halves of that matter.

An install that holds no row at all for a rate line has never had that
jurisdiction's rate, and giving it the shipped rows - including a closed
historical window, if the file ships one - is purely additive. An install that
holds *any* row for the line has the line, and this repair leaves it alone even
if the file has since grown a second window for it: a new window on an existing
rate is a rate that changed, which is a ``superseded`` repair that has to close
the old window as it opens the new one. Doing that here would be exactly the
retroactive rewrite the registry's natures exist to keep apart, so it is
refused rather than approximated.

One shipped rate is on that side of the line today and it is worth naming
rather than leaving as an artefact. Nova Scotia cut its harmonised rate from
15 % to 14 % on 2025-04-01, and the file carries both windows. An install
seeded before v15.5.0 already holds the 15 % row, so the line reads as present
and the 14 % row is not delivered here. That is not a gap any more:
:mod:`app.modules.i18n_foundation.tax_window_supersede` closes the open window
and inserts the rate that replaced it, which is the ``superseded`` shape this
module is forbidden to take. Its population is derived from the same seed file,
so the division between the two is a property of the data rather than a list
either of them keeps: a rate line absent from a database belongs here, and a
rate line present at a superseded rate belongs there.

What was deliberately not generalised
-------------------------------------
Fifty-nine seed functions across forty-two files carry the same early return,
but almost all of them seed a demo project, where seeding once is the intended
behaviour and a later addition is meant for the next demo rather than for this
one. Five of them seed shipped reference data out of a data file: the three in
``i18n_foundation/seed.py`` and the two in ``app/scripts/seed_starter.py``.

Only tax rates got a reconciler, and the reason is the delete question rather
than effort. Every safety argument above rests on the identity of a row being
stable and meaningful - a tax line is one rate for one jurisdiction, and a
customer deleting one is making a statement about their business. A starter
cost item or a country row has no such identity: they are edited, renamed and
re-coded in normal use, so "absent" there does not mean what it means here, and
a reconciler could not tell a deleted row from a renamed one at all. Countries
and work calendars have the same defect and it is genuinely open; a country
missing from an old install is a real gap. Filling it needs a decision about
what identifies a row that people edit, and that decision is not this module's
to make.
