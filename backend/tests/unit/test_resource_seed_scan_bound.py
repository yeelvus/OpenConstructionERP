"""Seeding the resource sheet must read the region in bounded pages.

``seed_region`` runs inside the same request as a cost-base import, directly
after it, and it walks the components breakdown of every work item in the
region. Reading that in one buffered result put tens of thousands of those JSON
breakdowns in memory at once, on a machine that had just finished holding the
import, and the kernel killed the process. The operator saw a server that
stopped, not a seed that failed, so nothing pointed at this loop.

The bound is checked by watching the page sizes the scan asks the session for,
rather than by measuring memory. The page size is what this code decides;
resident memory is decided by the driver, the allocator and the garbage
collector too, and a test measuring it would fail for reasons unrelated to this
loop. The limit is read back off the compiled statement so the assertions are
about what the scan requested, not about what a fake chose to hand it.

The last two tests are the control. One runs the same seed with the bound
raised out of reach, which is what removing the paging would look like from
inside the loop, and asserts the single unbounded page that would then appear.
The other asserts the bounded and unbounded runs agree on every number and on
every row written, because paging a scan is only correct if it changes nothing
but the peak.

No database is involved: the session is replaced by a recorder that serves the
pages the statement asks for.
