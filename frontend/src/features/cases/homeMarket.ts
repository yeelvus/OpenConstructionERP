// Cases - the market a UI language speaks for, and the ordering that follows.
//
// A language is not a country, and this file exists to keep that sentence true
// rather than to paper over it. Of the languages the product ships, ten reach
// a market the catalogue actually has cases for; the rest reach none, and the
// honest answer for them is the order the catalogue already had.
//
// Nothing here filters. `homeMarketFirst` reorders and returns every case it
// was given, because the alternative - defaulting the market SELECTOR to the
// language - would hide the 140 universal cases from the reader whose language
// happens to name a market, and those cases are the product rather than a
// backlog (see the `region` doc in ./types.ts and the market shelf comment in
// ./CasesPage.tsx). The same "same market first, then the rest, both in
// lifecycle order" shape is already how `moreCasesFor` in ./relatedness.ts
// lays out the strip at the foot of a case, so a reader meets one idea twice
// rather than two.

/**
 * The market a UI language speaks for, or `null` when it speaks for none the
 * catalogue has cases for.
 *
 * `markets` is the set of region codes the catalogue actually carries (the
 * hub's `regions`), so a market with no cases can never become an answer, and
 * a market that gains its first case starts being answered with no edit here.
 *
 * The country comes from `SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES`, where every language already
 * declares one for its flag. That registry is the single place this product
 * says which country a language belongs to, and reusing it means the two can
 * never drift apart. It also settles the sharp cases on its own:
 *
 *   - `es` declares `es`, so Spanish reaches the Spanish cases. `es-MX`,
 *     `es-CL` and `es-CO` declare `mx`, `cl` and `co`, and what each of them
 *     reaches follows the catalogue rather than the language: Mexico has a
 *     case of its own now, so `es-MX` leads with that, while `es-CL` and
 *     `es-CO` still reach none. What none of the three reaches is Spain, and
 *     that is the point rather than a gap: the Spanish cases implement Spanish
 *     public procurement, FIEBDC-3 and Spanish site paperwork, and leading
 *     with them for a Mexican reader would not merely be unhelpful, it would
 *     name a law that does not apply where they work.
 *   - `pt` and `pt-BR` declare `pt` and `br`. Brazil has a case and Portugal
 *     does not, so the two have parted company: `pt-BR` reaches Brazil and
 *     `pt` reaches none. The shape is the same as Spanish; only the counts
 *     differ.
 *   - `en` declares `gb` and `en-US` declares `us`, and the catalogue has both
 *     British and American cases, so the two English entries separate cleanly.
 *
 * A tag the registry does not list is read through its region subtag instead,
 * and the subtag wins outright rather than falling back to the base language's
 * country: `de-AT` and `de-CH` reach no market rather than the German one,
 * `fr-CA` reaches Canada. A bare tag the registry does not list reaches
 * nothing, because a language on its own is not evidence about a country.
 *
 * Note the limit that rule cannot fix from here: `resolveInitialLanguage` in
 * app/i18n.ts strips the region off a browser locale before the app ever sees
 * it, so an Austrian browser arrives as plain `de`. This function will answer
 * `DE` for that reader. That is survivable only because the answer orders the
 * catalogue instead of narrowing it - an Austrian sees the German cases first
 * and every other case right behind them.
