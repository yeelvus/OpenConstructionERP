"""A contract family is registered in three places or it is half present.

Three modules hold a table of contract standards and they are at three
different granularities:

* ``contracts.CONTRACT_CLAUSE_TEMPLATES`` - the document catalogue, one row per
  standard-form document and option (``nec4_ecc_option_a`` and
  ``nec4_ecc_option_c`` are different contracts).
* ``variations._VARIATION_CLAUSES`` - the variation clause reference, one row
  per standard edition, because the clause number moves between editions.
* ``change_intelligence.NOTICE_PERIODS`` - the notice periods, one row per
  family, because the windows are family-level and stable across editions.

They are not duplicates of each other and unifying them would force one
granularity onto all three. What they do share is a bridge:
``time_bar.normalize_standard`` maps any of these vocabularies onto a family.
These tests guard the bridge, so that a family added to one table and forgotten
in another is a red test rather than a contract that silently gets neutral
fallback notice periods, or a blank variation clause on every record.

Reaching a family is not the same as reaching periods. ``normalize_standard``
recognises families the notice engine deliberately holds no periods for
(``NOTICE_PERIODS_HELD``), so "the bridge answered" cannot stand in for "the
engine can time this". The question asked below is therefore whether a code
reaches a family that is *in* ``NOTICE_PERIODS``, which is the property every
caller of these tables actually depends on.

Adding a family to only some of the tables is allowed. Saying so out loud is
not optional: put it on the deliberately-absent list below with the consequence
spelled out, so whoever reads it is deciding rather than discovering.
