"""The contract standard a demo pack declares must reach the notice engine.

Driven from the shipped packs rather than from a constructed contract, because
a hand-built fixture is exactly what let the defect sit. ``normalize_standard``
mapped a FIDIC string to FIDIC in isolation and always had; what nothing
checked was the seam - whether any demo project put a standard anywhere the
resolver actually looks. None did, so every demo project fell through to the
standard-neutral periods, including the one whose pack names FIDIC, which the
engine supports and holds correct periods for.

Each test states the population it swept and asserts a floor on it. A suite of
this shape passes vacuously the day the packs stop declaring a form, and a
green run over an empty set is the failure mode it exists to prevent.
