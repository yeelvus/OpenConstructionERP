"""A diacritic must not decide which trade a line item lands in.

The classifier matches keyword substrings, so before accents were folded the
answer depended on whether the export that produced the text kept its marks:
``Rückbau`` was demolition and ``Ruckbau`` was other, ``Serviços`` and
``Servicos`` were two different strings. Folding one side alone only moves
which spelling gets missed, so both sides are folded.

The fold is not free, which is why ``ACCENT_IS_LOAD_BEARING`` exists, and the
last test here is what keeps that list from outliving its reason.
