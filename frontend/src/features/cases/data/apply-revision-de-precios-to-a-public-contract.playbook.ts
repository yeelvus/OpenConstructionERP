// Case: "Apply revision de precios to a public works contract" (ES).
//
// Revision de precios on Spanish public work is not automatic and it is not a
// negotiation: it applies only where the contract provided for it, only after
// the periods the law fixes, and only through the polynomial formula the
// contract names, whose index values are published rather than agreed.
//
// The product carries a cost index as a series of period factors plus regional
// location factors, and applies temporal times location as one multiplier. It
// does NOT compute the polynomial split by material family. The case therefore
// walks the user through recording the resulting coefficient per period and
// applying it, and says plainly that the formula arithmetic happens outside.
// Content strings are key plus inline English default and live only here.

  longDescDefault:
    "Revision de precios is the mechanism that lets a long public contract survive a change in the price of steel or fuel, and it is narrower than most people assume. It applies only where the contract expressly provided for it, only to work executed after the qualifying period, and only through the formula the contract names, using index values that are published rather than negotiated. What the platform holds is the result: a cost index series of one factor per period, optional regional location factors, and the arithmetic that applies them to an amount. The polynomial split by material family, with the fixed coefficients of the formula, is computed outside and what you enter here is the coefficient it produced for that month. Written down that way, the revision on a certificacion is a number anybody can reproduce from the same published sources, which is the only kind of revision that survives an audit.",
