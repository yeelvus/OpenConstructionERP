"""``/api/health`` says whether the record of the boot-time repairs survived.

``run_data_repairs`` returns ``ledger_written`` separately from the repair
outcomes, and the report's own docstring argues at length for why: a repair can
succeed against a database whose role may write rows but not create tables, in
which case the data is correct and the *record* of it is missing, and
collapsing the two would let the smaller failure hide the larger.

The boot path published the outcomes side and threw the other one away. With
``oe_data_repair_ledger`` dropped, both registered repairs landed,
``ledger_written`` came back ``False``, and ``/api/health`` answered ``healthy``
with ``data_repairs_failed: false``. Nothing on that install could then answer
"did this repair run here", which is the only question the ledger exists for,
and nothing said so. Reporting them separately is worth nothing unless both are
then published; this file holds the second half.

The key is ``data_repair_ledger_failed`` and not ``ledger_written`` because of
its neighbours. ``schema_heal_failed`` and ``data_repairs_failed`` both read
``true`` for bad news and are both tested with ``is True``; a field on the same
payload whose ``true`` meant good news would make every monitor rule carry one
opposite predicate for one field, which is how a rule ends up written the wrong
way round.

Three states, for the same reason the fields beside it have three. ``true`` at
least one ledger write failed, ``false`` every one was written, ``null`` the
pass never ran - where a deployment whose database is not PostgreSQL stays for
its whole life, because the repair pass sits inside the same ``if "postgresql"
in settings.database_url`` branch the heal does. That third state is what stops
``false`` from ever being readable as "nothing was attempted": a pass that did
not run never leaves ``null``.
