"""The tax seed reconciler, against the two cohorts it has to tell apart.

Why the fixtures are built the way they are
-------------------------------------------
The defect under test survived five tests of the neighbouring repair, and it
survived them because all five built their fixture in a state the affected
cohort never reaches. So the two cohorts here are reconstructed from the seed
files those releases actually shipped, taken out of git, and each one carries a
digest of the real file so the reconstruction cannot drift away from it: change
``tax_configurations.json`` in a way that breaks the reconstruction and these
tests say so rather than quietly testing a database nobody has.

The reconstruction is written as exclusions from today's file rather than as a
vendored copy, and the digests are what make that honest. They were taken from
``git show d27f29ffa:...`` and ``git show 2dc7354a0:...``, the commits that
shipped in v15.5.0's predecessor and in v15.6.0.

Both cohorts are also put into the schema state the BOOT HEAL leaves, not the
one ``create_all`` builds. The heal adds the subdivision check constraint
``NOT VALID``, which is the only reason a v15.9.1 database can hold eleven rows
that break it; a fixture built under the validated constraint cannot even be
inserted, and a repair tested against one would never meet the rows it exists
for.

What each cohort is
-------------------
``pre_v15_5_0``
    Seeded from the 70-row file, before ``combination`` existed. The heal adds
    that column filled with its server default, so every row reads ``national``
    and no row carries a subdivision. This is the install missing ten of
    Canada's ten sub-national rates.

``v15_9_1``
    Seeded from the 80-row file. It has ``combination`` and does not have
    ``subdivision_code``, so eleven of its rows break the constraint the heal
    later adds. This is the cohort that must NOT be given anything: it already
    has every rate, so a row missing from it was deleted on purpose.
