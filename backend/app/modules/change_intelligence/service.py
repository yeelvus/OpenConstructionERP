"""Change-intelligence service - the thin database layer over the pure engines.

Gathers the current state of every change-family record for a project (change
orders, variation notices / requests / orders, MoC entries) and feeds it to the
pure :mod:`cycle_time` engine to produce the "waiting on whom" board. Only the
columns the engine needs are selected (no relationship loading), so a project
with many change records stays cheap to summarise.

# --- Dispute-exposure radar (#7) -------------------------------------------

# Composes five sibling signals into the pure :mod:`dispute_risk` engine for
# every open change: provability (from :mod:`claims_evidence.provability`),
# overdue age (from the cycle-time aging math), an approval-SLA breach flag,
# ownership ambiguity (from the ownership-chain engine), and the money at risk
# (from the cost-recovery back-charge ledger). The engine's defaults are
# deliberately conservative, so a signal that is not cheaply available per
# change is passed at its safe (high-risk) default rather than fabricated:
#
# * notice / acknowledgement / linked-instruction / dated-record provability
#   signals are left at their conservative defaults - they need a per-change
#   evidence-pack join that this read does not perform - so a change with a
#   clean custody chain still scores in the weak band unless its evidence is
#   wired elsewhere. This is the documented "score an unwired change as if it
#   were weak" behaviour, not an error.
# * the approval-SLA breach flag is passed False: an approval instance is not
#   cheaply linkable to an arbitrary change-family record here. The overdue-age
#   factor still captures lateness from the response-due date the board uses.
#
# Money is taken from back-charges whose ``source_ref`` is the change id (the
# free reference the cost-recovery module stores), summed per change as the
# outstanding and committed-at-risk basis.
