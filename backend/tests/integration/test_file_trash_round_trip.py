"""Delete and restore every trash kind, through the endpoints, with real rows.

The recycle bin is polymorphic: one table holds a JSON snapshot of a row
belonging to any of eight kinds. Every existing test drove one half of that
loop - ``soft_delete`` with a synthetic payload, or ``restore`` from a
hand-written one - so nothing walked the round trip a user walks: delete a
real row, then press Restore.

That gap hid a defect. ``restore`` decided which snapshot values to convert
back out of JSON by the *name* of the key: anything ending in ``_id`` became
a ``UUID``, anything ending in ``_at`` or ``_date`` became a ``datetime``.
Ten columns across six of the eight kinds carry such a name on a ``String``
column, so the conversion handed a varchar an object it cannot store and the
insert failed inside ``flush`` with an asyncpg ``DataError``. A name is not a
type.

Two things follow for this file. It walks every kind, so the next model whose
column type disagrees with its key name is caught by the loop. And the seeded
rows deliberately fill every String column named the way the old rule keyed
off - :func:`test_the_seeds_fill_every_column_the_old_name_rule_would_convert`
fails if a new one appears unseeded, because a round trip that leaves the
dangerous columns NULL passes without ever touching the defect.
