"""One rule, three places it has to hold: a weekday is 1..7, Monday to Sunday.

``I18nFoundationService.get_working_days`` counts a working week by matching
each date's ``isoweekday()`` against the calendar's ``work_days``. That call
returns 1 through 7 and never 0, so any other number in the column matches no
date at all and shortens the week without telling anyone.

The platform shipped exactly that. ``seed_data/work_calendars.json`` carried
Saudi Arabia as ``[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`` - Sunday to Thursday, written with Sunday
as 0 the way JavaScript's ``getDay()`` and cron count - and every install
counted Saudi Arabia as a four-day week. Nothing was raised, nothing was
logged; a duration converted to a finish date simply stretched.

Two convictions worth carrying forward from how it survived. The trap itself
was already known and written down: ``tests/modules/i18n_foundation/
test_i18n_foundation_calendar.py`` has a test for a calendar declaring
weekday 0, naming the zero-based convention as the cause. It used DE as its
stand-in, so nobody grepping for SA ever found it. And the input validation
that test called for would not have caught this row anyway, because
``seed.py`` constructs ``WorkCalendar(...)`` straight on the ORM: the bad
value came in through the wall, not the door. So this file checks the wall
(the seed file), the door (the write schemas) and the repair for the installs
that already swallowed it (the migration), rather than any one of them.

The two zero-based conventions are both live in this repo, which is why the
seed file is checked rather than trusted. ``app/core/calendar.py``,
``app/core/cpm.py``, the schedule module and the work-calendar UI all count
Monday as 0 through ``date.weekday()``. This module counts Monday as 1. The
two disagree about ``[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`` without either being obviously wrong on
its face, and that is exactly the kind of value a reviewer's eye slides over.
