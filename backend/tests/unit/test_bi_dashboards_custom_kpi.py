"""Custom KPI definitions - issue #441.

The module shipped 35 built-in KPIs and no way to add a 36th without
shipping Python. These tests pin the way in that was added for the people
who cannot ship Python: a declarative spec over a whitelisted entity,
checked when the definition is created rather than when it is computed.

The three specs exercised here are the ones the reporter asked for, an
estimating SME with a per-position confidence score:

* amount-weighted bid confidence, ``sum(confidence * amount) / sum(amount)``
* the largest position of each bid
* how many positions are scored below a confidence threshold

Test isolation: a transaction-isolated PostgreSQL session on the shared
schema-loaded ``oe_test_unit`` database, rolled back on teardown.

Run:
    cd backend
    python -m pytest tests/unit/test_bi_dashboards_custom_kpi.py -v --tb=short
