/**
 * The role vocabulary the UI borrows from the backend permission registry.
 *
 * `backend/app/core/permissions.py` is the authority: it resolves a role
 * through `ROLE_ALIASES` and then compares it against `ROLE_HIERARCHY`, and
 * every server-side check goes through that pair. The UI needs the same
 * vocabulary only to decide what to OFFER, never to decide what is permitted,
 * so a copy that drifts shows the wrong affordance rather than granting
 * access. Wrong affordances are still expensive: a button hidden from the one
 * role the backend accepts reads as a broken feature, and a button offered to
 * a role the backend rejects reads as a broken backend.
 *
 * This file exists because the same two tables had been typed out by hand in
 * three feature files, which is three chances to update two of them. What is
 * shared here is the DATA. The wrappers around it deliberately are not: see
 * `normalizeRole` below for the one decision a caller has to make for itself.
 *
 * `scripts/check_role_mirrors_match_the_backend.py` compares both tables
 * against the backend and fails if either drifts, or if a second copy of
 * either appears anywhere under `frontend/src`.

/**
 * Legacy and industry role names that resolve to a canonical role.
 *
 * These are not decorative. A user whose stored role is `estimator` is granted
 * exactly what an `editor` is granted, so a UI that does not know the alias

 *
 * A caller that must tell "no role at all" apart from "the viewer role" cannot

 * RANKS rather than names, `viewer` has rank 0, and its cheapest permissions
