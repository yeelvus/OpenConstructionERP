"""First tests for the AIA payment application renderer.

This module renders a contract document that goes to an owner and an architect,
and until now it had no test of any kind anywhere in the tree. The defect these
cover is what that allowed to ship: a plain string table cell is drawn directly
rather than parsed as markup, so escaping its value puts the entity on the page.
A party named ``R&D Tower`` printed as ``R&amp;D Tower``, and because the
escaping ran with quote=True, ``O'Brien Construction`` printed as
``O&#x27;Brien Construction``. The apostrophe is the wide case: it needs no
unusual punctuation at all, only a name of a kind this document's market is
full of.

The last test here guards the other direction, because the two cell kinds in
this document want opposite treatment and the obvious repair to one of them
breaks the other.
