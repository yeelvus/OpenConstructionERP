"""The AGPL-3.0 text has to be present, verbatim, and reachable by the build.

The project declares ``AGPL-3.0-or-later`` everywhere it can - the SPDX
expression in ``pyproject.toml``, the trove classifier, ``NOTICE``, the desktop
installer EULA, and a line in the About page telling users the full text ships
with the source. Up to and including 15.9.1 none of that was true: the repo-root
``LICENSE`` was a summary, no copy of the licence text existed anywhere in the
tree, the built wheel's ``dist-info`` had no licence file, and the container
image carried none either. A summary sitting where the licence belongs is worse
than an obvious absence, because it looks like the thing it replaces.

Two copies of the text exist, and they exist for different consumers:

* ``LICENSE`` at the repo root, which is where the licence conventionally lives,
  where GitHub's detector reads it, and what ``desktop/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json``
  points the installer at.
* ``backend/LICENSE``, which is the one the wheel can actually use. PEP 639
  resolves ``license-files`` against the project root, and for this build that is
  ``backend/``, which cannot reach ``../LICENSE``.

NOTICE is the same arrangement for the same reason, and it was missing for
longer. The published 16.0.0 wheel holds 3860 entries and NOTICE is not among
them, so a pip install conveys the AGPL text and no attribution index at all.
What makes that particular absence awkward is that six bundled font and font
engine licences do travel in that wheel, inside ``app/`` where they sit under
the package directory rather than beside it, and NOTICE is the file that says
what they are, which bundled binaries carry code nobody declared, and where the
per-release inventory is published. The one file a reader would go to first was
the one they could not reach.

Duplication is the deliberate trade, and this module is what stops it drifting.
The AGPL-3.0 text is frozen (the FSF will not revise version 3), so the only way
the two licence copies can diverge is by accident, which is exactly what an
assertion is for. NOTICE is the opposite case and needs the assertion more: it
is edited every time a dependency starts or stops bundling somebody else's
object code, and an edit that lands in one copy and not the other leaves the
wheel conveying a stale account of what it contains.

Line endings are normalised before comparing. ``core.autocrlf`` is on for many
contributors, so the working-tree bytes differ by platform even though the git
blob does not; what has to hold is that the text is the same, not that a
checkout picked one convention.
