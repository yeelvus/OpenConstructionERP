"""Phone-log ORM model.

Tables:
    oe_phonelog_phone_log - a captured phone call, voice note, or verbal
    instruction, normalized into a dispute-ready record (canonical direction
    and channel, a clean party list, a reliable duration, a short summary, and
    the instruction-bearing sentences pulled out of the transcript) and tied to
    a project. The raw transcript is kept verbatim as the underlying evidence,
    and for a record ingested from a recording the audio itself is stored too
    (see ``audio_storage_key`` for where it goes and how long it lives).
