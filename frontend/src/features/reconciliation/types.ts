// Wire types for the event-reconciliation API. The reconciliation engine scores
// heterogeneous project records (correspondence, change orders, variations,
// management-of-change entries) and emits explainable links between the records
// that are really about the same underlying event. A reviewer then confirms or
// rejects each suggested link; those decisions are persisted as RecordLink rows.

// proposal that no one has ruled on yet (no row exists); "confirmed" / "rejected"
// are stored decisions.

// or null when the row is undated; refs are the tracked codes (CO-14 etc.) the
// record carries. is_seed marks the record the thread was assembled around.
