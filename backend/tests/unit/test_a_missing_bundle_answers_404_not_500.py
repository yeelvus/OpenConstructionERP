"""A deployment without a frontend must not look like a crashed server.

Two states, and until this fix they were answered by one bug and one silence.

A server that never found a bundle already answered 404, because
``mount_frontend`` returns before registering the SPA fallback. The 404 was the
bare ``{"detail":"Not Found"}`` FastAPI produces for a route that does not
exist, which reads as a mistyped URL. The truth is that the wheel shipped
without a UI, or the volume holding the build never mounted, and the server
knows that at startup.

A server that mounted a bundle and then lost it answered 500. ``FileResponse``
raises ``RuntimeError`` on a path that is not there, and the ASGI stack turns
that into ``Internal Server Error`` in plain text. An operator reading that goes
looking for an application crash, when the application is healthy and a
directory is gone. Measured before the fix, with the whole dist removed under a
running client: ``/boq`` 500, ``/favicon.svg`` 500, ``/logo.svg`` 500.

``/assets/*`` belongs on that list too, and the way it hides is worth pinning.
``StaticFiles`` stats its directory once and raises ``RuntimeError`` if it is
gone, and that check runs on the FIRST REQUEST, not at construction. So a server
that had served one asset before the dist vanished answered 404, and a server
whose dist went missing before its first asset request answered 500. Same
deployment, opposite diagnosis, decided by traffic order - and a first probe
that happened to warm the mount reported the honest number.

``raise_server_exceptions=False`` throughout, deliberately. Under the default
the pre-fix code raises ``RuntimeError`` out of the client instead of returning
500, so a test written the usual way passes against the broken code for the
wrong reason and proves nothing.
