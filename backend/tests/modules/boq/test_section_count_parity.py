"""A bill's card and the bill itself must count the same line items.

A section header is stored with one of two spellings of ``Position.unit``:
``""`` is what the demo seeders write, ``"section"`` is what
``BOQService.create_section`` and every file importer write. The list of
bills counts line items with a SQL predicate, because it must answer for
many bills without loading their rows; the bill's own detail endpoint counts
them by calling ``_is_section`` on every row it has already loaded. Two
readers of one concept, so they have to agree on both spellings.

They did not. The SQL half read ``unit != ""`` and recognised only the empty
spelling, so every bill imported from a GAEB, Excel or BC3 file reported its
section headers as priced lines on its card while the bill itself did not
count them. The bug was invisible on seeded data, which is why the assertions
here are agreement between the two readers rather than an expected number: a
test pinning a count would have passed on a seeded bill and would never have
been written for an imported one.

Run:
    cd backend
    python -m pytest tests/modules/boq/test_section_count_parity.py -v
