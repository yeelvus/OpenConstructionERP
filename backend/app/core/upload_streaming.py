"""Streaming-upload helper.

UploadFile.read() loads the entire request body into memory.  On the
3 GB-RAM server this is a trivial DoS vector once we removed the per-route
size caps (a single 1 GB upload pushes the process into swap; a few
concurrent uploads OOM the box).

This module spools the upload to a real on-disk temp file in 1 MB
chunks, returning a :class:`pathlib.Path` the caller can hand straight
to :meth:`StorageBackend.put_stream` (which on the local backend is a
single ``rename`` syscall - close to free).

A SHA-256 of the upload is computed on the fly so callers don't need a
second pass over the bytes.

Typical use::

    from app.core.upload_streaming import stream_upload_to_temp

    async with stream_upload_to_temp(file) as upload:
        # upload.path: pathlib.Path to the spooled temp file
        # upload.size: int (bytes written)
        # upload.sha256_hex: str
        # upload.head: bytes - first ~64 bytes for magic-byte checks
        await storage.put_stream(key, upload.path)
        # ↑ on success, upload.path is moved/consumed.

The context manager removes the temp file on exit IF it still exists
(i.e. ``put_stream`` failed before consuming it).  Successful streaming
moves the file out from under us, which is fine - ``unlink`` no-ops on
a missing path.

    The old fixed 300 s ceiling we used for CAD/RVT/IFC conversion was a
    silent ceiling on legitimate uploads - a 100 MB hospital RVT model
    routinely needs 8-12 minutes of converter time, and the 5 min cap
    just SIGTERMed it without explanation. We now scale the timeout
    linearly with input size so big-but-real files succeed while a
    runaway converter still gets killed eventually.

    Args:
        size_bytes: Size of the input file on disk.  Negative values are
            clamped to 0 (defensive - callers occasionally pass
            ``stat().st_size`` of a missing file as -1).
        min_sec: Floor - used even for empty/tiny inputs, because
            converter startup itself takes 60-180 s regardless of
            input size. Default 600 s = 10 minutes.
        sec_per_mb: Linear growth rate.  Default 30 s/MB matches the
            slowest real-world DDC converter (Revit shelling out to the
            Teigha format readers on cold-cache).
        max_sec: Optional hard ceiling.  ``None`` (default) means
            unbounded - relies on ``min_sec`` as the only floor and
            the per-MB rate to scale up.

    Returns:

        ``asyncio.wait_for`` or ``subprocess.run(..., timeout=...)``.
