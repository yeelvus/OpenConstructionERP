"""The recurring-schedule register fills, and fills the projects still empty.

The service module's recurring schedules tab is a real screen with a real
backend, and every demo project opened it on an empty table, so the feature read
as unbuilt. ``seed_service_recurring_schedules`` fills it.

What is worth asserting is less that rows appear than *when* they appear. The
module's other seeder returns early as soon as any service contract exists,
which on an install that has been seeded once is always. A register wired into
that function would therefore only ever show up on a database that started
empty, which is no running deployment. This seeder asks the question per project
instead, so the tests below check both halves of that: a project that already
has a schedule is left exactly as it was, and a project that is still empty is
filled on the same run.

``next_run_at`` is checked against the library rather than against a date typed
into the test, because a seeded row whose next run disagrees with its own rule
is a row the cron worker will materialise at the wrong time.
