"""Fail if the weak-JWT-secret denylist or its length threshold is restated.

Why this exists. The denylist of known-weak JWT secrets and the 32-unit
minimum length lived in two files at once, ``app/config.py`` and
``app/main.py``, each maintained by hand. That shape is invisible while the
copies agree and silent when they stop agreeing, and these two had already
stopped: the copy in ``main.py`` was missing three of the strings the other
rejected, and it counted UTF-8 bytes where the other counted characters, so
they disagreed on any non-ASCII secret. Nobody noticed, because nothing was
comparing them.

Collapsing them fixes today. This script is what keeps them collapsed: it
fails the moment a second copy appears, rather than the moment the second
copy starts to matter.

Two independent checks, both over the AST rather than the text, so a
reformat or a different quote style cannot slip past:

1. A collection literal (set, frozenset, list, tuple) holding two or more
   known-weak secret strings, anywhere outside the canonical module.
2. A length comparison of the form ``len(<... jwt_secret ...>) < <number>``,
   anywhere outside the canonical module.

Usage:
    python scripts/check_secret_denylist_single_source.py

Exit codes: 0 clean, 1 a second copy was found, 2 the canonical module no
longer looks the way this script expects.
