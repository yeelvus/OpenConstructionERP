"""The weak-JWT-secret rules have one source of truth, and it is strict.

These constants used to exist twice, in ``app/config.py`` and in
``app/main.py``, maintained by hand. They had already drifted: the copy in
``main.py`` omitted three of the denied strings and measured length in UTF-8
bytes where the other measured characters. Nothing compared them, so nothing
reported it.

``scripts/check_secret_denylist_single_source.py`` keeps a second copy from
reappearing. These tests pin the behaviour the single copy must have, including
the cases on which the two old copies disagreed.
