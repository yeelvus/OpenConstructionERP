// An Indian bill of quantities printed `476,579,722.78`. The number is right
// and the way it is written is not: India groups the last three digits and
// then twos, so every estimator, contractor and auditor in that market reads
// that figure as `47,65,79,722.78`. A bill grouped the Western way reads as
// somebody else's document.
//
// `Intl` already knows this - `en-IN` produces the lakh grouping with no
// custom code - so the defect was never the arithmetic, it was which tag
// reached the formatter. `resolveNumberLocale` answered `'auto'` with the UI
// LANGUAGE, and the UI language of an Indian workspace is usually English,
// which resolves to `en-US`. Nothing in the chain ever asked which market the
// workspace serves.
//
// The half of this that a happy-path test cannot see is the mechanism. Two
// assertions below pin it, and both fail against any fix that merely re-tags
// the reader's own language with an Indian region:
//
//   - A GERMAN reader still gets lakh grouping, because the grouping belongs
//     to the document's market and not to whoever opened it. Measured,
//     `de-IN` resolves to plain `de` and prints `476.579.722,78`, so this
//     assertion is only satisfiable by carrying a tag CLDR has Indian number
//     data for.
//   - A reader who explicitly picked `de-DE` keeps it. The market is a
//     fallback for `'auto'`, never an override, which is what keeps this from
//     becoming a second answer to "which locale does the reader read numbers
//     in".
