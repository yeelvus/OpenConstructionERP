"""Counting a period of days on a stated basis. Pure functions, standard library only.

A contractual or statutory period is either a run of calendar days or a run of
working days, and which one it is changes the answer by several days. This
module owns that arithmetic for the whole platform so that a deadline computed
by one engine equals the same deadline computed by another.

It was extracted verbatim from :mod:`app.modules.payment_clock.clock`, which
still re-exports both names and remains the place where the payment sequence is
argued. It lives in ``app.core`` rather than in that module because the notice
and time-bar engine in ``oe_change_intelligence`` needs the same arithmetic, and
``oe_payment_clock`` is a *regional* module whose manifest states that a
deployment outside a security-of-payment jurisdiction should be able to switch
it off. A controls module must not stop counting deadlines because a regional
one was removed.

**Business days are Monday to Friday minus a calendar the deployment supplies.**
Public holidays are deliberately not shipped here: they differ by jurisdiction
and change every year, and a wrong holiday list is worse than an honest
weekends-only count because it produces a date nobody can reproduce. Callers
with a holiday calendar pass it as ``holidays``.

That decision is what separates this module from :mod:`app.core.calendar`, which
does ship per-country holiday tables and counts on a *scheduling* convention: it
rolls a start date that is not a working day forward before counting, and its
result is inclusive of the start. Here, day one is the day after the start date,
which is how the statutes and contracts these periods come from are counted and
how a court reads them. The two conventions give different answers whenever a
period starts on a weekend, so they are not interchangeable and neither is
wrong - they answer different questions. Use this module for a deadline and
``app.core.calendar`` for a schedule.
