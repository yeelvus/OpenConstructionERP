"""Hours booked on site, read back against the bill position that predicted them.

The money side of this report was already here. This is the other half an
estimator asks for: an estimate written from productivity norms predicts labour
hours per unit, and until the hours the crew booked can be read against the same
position the norm library cannot learn anything from the job it was used on.

Three things are worth testing and only one of them is the happy path.

A corrected day must be worth nothing. Correcting an approved timesheet does not
edit it: the original flips to ``reversed`` and a mirror sheet is written whose
hours are still POSITIVE, because in that module the sign lives on the sheet.
The obvious filter, ``status == 'approved'``, therefore drops the original and
counts the mirror at face value, reporting the cancelled hours once, in full, in
the wrong direction. Nothing but a test with a real reversed pair in it catches
that.

The per-unit figure must refuse where it has no denominator. Hours over the
BILLED quantity flatter every unfinished item and flatter an untouched one most
of all, which is the same failure as a zero risk dispersion. The control here
is the assertion that the rate is NOT the number the billed denominator would
have produced.
