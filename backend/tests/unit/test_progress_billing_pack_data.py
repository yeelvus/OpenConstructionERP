"""The progress billing figures in the national packs say where they came from.

``us_pack`` and ``dach_pack`` carry a ``progress_billing`` block: retention
tiers and caps, the events that release retention and the documents each one
needs, the evidence stored materials need before they are billable, the
certificates a subcontractor must hold before it is paid, the billing cycle,
and the code a change-order line gets. A contract is seeded from these, so a
wrong figure is billed.

The rule held here is the one ``test_us_state_packs`` holds for the state
packs, applied to this block: the dict holding a number carries a non-empty
``statute_reference`` or ``source`` plus an ``effective_date`` key (``None``
is an answer, a missing key is not); only a list element such as a retention
tier may lean on the dict that lists it. No test can know the number is
right; these make sure it says who said so.

The second half is the joins. The block names payment clock regimes, a tax
withholding scheme, a contract security type, subcontractor certificate and
waiver types, and document roles. Each name is checked against the vocabulary
that will read it, because a name nothing recognises is inert data that no
page would show as broken.

Pure dict work plus schema imports; nothing here queries a database.
