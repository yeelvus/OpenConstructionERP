"""Unit tests - a DDC conversion failure belongs to the conversion that hit it.

``process_ifc_file`` runs on a shared thread pool (``asyncio.to_thread`` in
the bim_hub router), so two users' uploads convert at the same time. The
failure context the router folds into ``model.error_message`` therefore has
to be scoped to one conversion. A record shared by the whole process reports
one upload's stderr tail - which carries the other user's file path and file
name - on someone else's model.

The tests below interleave two conversions on purpose: both record a failure
before either reads one back. A process-wide record fails them.
