"""Refuse a new collection endpoint that answers with a bare array.

The pagination programme migrates registers one wave at a time, from a bare
``list[...]`` to ``{items, total, offset, limit}``. Waves subtract; nothing
stopped the tree from adding. Every new module shipped another handful of
routes that answer with the first page and say nothing about the rest, so the
only metered side of the account was the side doing the work.

This is the other side. Every bare-list GET that existed when the guard was
written is in ``ALLOWED`` and stays legal until someone migrates it. A route
that is not in that list is new, and new is where the line is drawn: writing
one costs a conversation now rather than a wave later.

``ALLOWED`` is also the census. It is exact, it is checked both ways, and its
size is printed on every successful run, so the number falls as registers are
migrated and anyone can see it fall. An entry that no longer names a bare-list
route fails the run rather than lingering, because a list that keeps entries it
has outgrown stops being a count of anything and starts quietly re-permitting
whatever later takes the same name.

A second list, ``CANNOT_TRUNCATE``, holds the routes that must keep answering
with the whole set because a partial answer from them would be wrong rather
than short. Those two lists mean opposite things, so they are disjoint and the
countdown is the size of ``ALLOWED`` alone: it targets zero. ``--dump`` rewrites
``ALLOWED`` and never touches ``CANNOT_TRUNCATE``, which is what keeps a
justification attached to the entry it justifies.

Definition of a bare-list endpoint, matching the census this list was built
from: a function decorated with ``@router.get(...)`` whose ``response_model``
is a ``list[...]`` subscript, or which declares no ``response_model`` and whose
return annotation is ``list[...]``. Parsed with ast rather than a regex, so a
decorator split over several lines and a return annotation on a line of its own
are both read correctly.

# migration wave, and let the diff show the routes that left.
#
# Nothing but entries goes between the braces below. The region is machine
# written, so a comment placed inside it is deleted by the next --dump while
# the entry it explains survives without it; main() refuses a run that finds

# entry must never be migrated belongs in CANNOT_TRUNCATE above instead.
#
# The qms trio is here rather than in CANNOT_TRUNCATE. list_calibrations,
# list_expiring_calibrations and list_itp_templates have no frontend caller at
# all, which is why they stayed behind while the other eight moved: no wrapper
# means no census of who reads them, and backend tests do, so the readers have
# to be enumerated before the shape changes under them. That is work not yet
# done, not work that must not be done.
#
# Regenerate from a clean checkout, not from the working tree. This repository
# is worked by several sessions at once, so the tree on disk holds routes that
# are not committed yet. The first draft of this list was taken from the tree
# and picked up one such route; CI reads the commit, found no such route, and
# the guard would have arrived red through no fault of the tree. A census of
# what is committed is the only census the gate can hold itself to.

    ``--dump`` reproduces that region entry by entry and nothing else, so a

    explains stays behind. A route documented as unmigratable then reads as one
    more route waiting its turn, which is the failure ``CANNOT_TRUNCATE``
