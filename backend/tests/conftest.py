"""Shared test fixtures.

Test isolation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Per ``feedback_test_isolation.md``: backend tests must NEVER touch the
production database. Several integration suites
(``test_api_smoke``, ``test_boq_regression``, ``test_boq_import_safety``,
``test_boq_cycle_detection``, ``test_boq_cost_item_link``) construct the
FastAPI app via ``create_app()`` which imports ``app.database`` and
binds ``async_session_factory`` to whatever ``DATABASE_URL`` is set at
that moment — so the env vars have to point at a throwaway PostgreSQL
cluster *before* any ``from app...`` import runs.

Doing it here in ``tests/conftest.py`` (which pytest loads before any
test module) guarantees the override beats every test-module import
order, regardless of which suite is collected first. Tests that already
self-redirect (``test_tenant_isolation``, ``test_register_bootstrap``,
etc.) are still fine — they overwrite this with their own connection.

# The app is PostgreSQL-only at runtime, so the test suite runs on PostgreSQL
# too. Two ways to provide it:
#   * CI sets ``DATABASE_URL`` (a postgres service container) — honour it as-is.
#   * Otherwise boot a throwaway embedded PostgreSQL 16 cluster (no Docker) into
#     a temp data dir for the session. ``embedded_pg.boot`` points
#     ``DATABASE_URL`` / ``DATABASE_SYNC_URL`` at the embedded cluster and is
#     registered for shutdown via ``atexit`` so the postmaster is stopped when
#     the run ends, and the data dir is removed with it.
# This must happen before any ``from app...`` import that pulls in
# ``app.database`` (which builds the engine from ``settings.database_url`` at
# import time).
#
# This used to say the temp dir was reclaimed by the OS regardless, and that
# belief is why nobody looked: shutdown stops the postmaster and never removed
# the directory, and nothing else does either, so every single run left its
# cluster on disk. One workstation had accumulated 712 of them, 59.5 GB, before
# anyone noticed the disk rather than the cause.

#: How recently a data dir may have been touched and still be considered a
#: candidate for reaping. Only a belt to the braces below: a session that has
#: just created its data dir but whose postmaster has not yet written its pid
#: file is indistinguishable from a dead one for a second or two.

    The suite is supposed to be hermetic, and mostly is - clients are mocked

    just went out and left a line in the log that somebody had to notice. The
    nightly full run did exactly that: one ``POST https://api.anthropic.com``
    per night, answered 401 because the only key in play was the fixture's own
    ``sk-test-fake-key``. Harmless that time, and precisely the point - the
    same escape with a real key spends money, and either way it makes our runs
    depend on somebody else's availability.

    What counts as egress is the transport, not the hostname. A test that
    installs ``MockTransport`` or ``ASGITransport`` is hermetic no matter how
    real its base URL looks, and plenty of them point at the very vendor URLs
    the production client uses - judging by host would fail those for doing
    exactly the right thing. Resolving the transport the way httpx itself does
    also leaves PostgreSQL and any loopback service alone for free. Mark a test

def _isolate_unit_tests_from_leaked_subscribers(request):
    """Keep a leaked application subscriber out of a unit test's publishes.

    ``_sync_publish_detached`` above picks its regime from what is on the bus:
    with a subscriber that does real I/O registered it schedules the publish on
    the loop, and every pure recorder goes with it. That is correct for an
    integration test, which starts the app and wants those handlers to run, and
    wrong for a unit test, which subscribes a recorder and asserts on it on the
    very next line with no await in between.

    Nothing removes those handlers once registered. So a single test that
    subscribed one and did not unsubscribe silently flipped every unit test that
    ran after it onto the loop regime, and they failed on an empty recorder in
    an unrelated module, hundreds of tests away from the cause and green again
    the moment that file was run on its own. ``test_dashboards_t01_service.py``
    was the one that surfaced it, on ``assert 'snapshot.created' in []``.

    Unit tests never start the app, so for them these handlers are always
    leakage. This fixture marks the scope; the exclusion itself happens in
    ``_sync_publish_detached`` and covers **both** registries, the per-event
    ``_handlers`` as well as the ``"*"`` ``_wildcard_handlers``. The predecessor
    of this fixture looked only at the wildcard list, which is how a leaked
    ``boq.position.created`` subscriber survived and got hand-stepped into a live
    asyncpg read, corrupting the session-scoped loop for the rest of the process.

    Excluding at the publish boundary rather than deleting from the bus is
    deliberate. Deleting would make every test that asserts on the wiring
    order-dependent: ``test_doc_assistant_wiring.py`` imports its events modules
    *inside* the test body, so run alone it re-registers after the deletion and
    passes, and run in a chunk the import is a no-op and it fails. Shipping a
    fresh instance of the bug class we are removing is not a fix. So the bus
    keeps its handlers and the publish simply does not fan out to them.

    """Guard the process-global validation registry against cross-test pollution.

    A few suites swap the module-level ``validation_engine`` or replace/empty its
    registry to exercise edge cases; without a restore, a later test that runs a
    real rule set - inline BOQ-import validation, the pipeline graph gate - finds
    an empty registry and reports every requested set as ``unsupported``. After
    each test put the engine and its registry back, and re-register the built-ins
    if they went missing (``register_builtin_rules`` is idempotent).

    Registering on the way IN matters just as much, and used to be missing. The
    application calls ``register_builtin_rules`` from its lifespan, which no test
    process starts, so the registry began every run empty and was populated only
    as a side effect of this fixture's teardown. The first test in the process to
    ask for a rule set therefore got nothing: the engine marks an absent set as
    unsupported and returns a clean report, which is indistinguishable from the
    rules having run and found no problem. Whether a validation test was real then
    depended on where pytest happened to order it. Measured 2026-07-27 with
    ``tests/unit/test_validation_registry_populated.py``, which saw the registry
    holding ``[]`` at the first test and every built-in set present by the second.

    Both calls used to be guarded by ``"boq_quality" not in list_rule_sets()``,
    and that sentinel is not a property of the built-in pack alone. Modules
    register into the same shared set name as an import side effect:
    ``app.modules.esg.validators`` registers its rule into
    ``["esg_site", "boq_quality"]`` when the module is imported. In a process
    that imported it first, the sentinel reads as satisfied while ``din276``,
    ``gaeb`` and the rest of the built-ins are still absent, so the repair never
    runs and the engine answers a request for them with an empty ``skipped``
    report that is indistinguishable from a pass. That is the shape of the
    2026-08-21 shard failure in ``tests/unit/test_boq_import_validation.py``.
    Register unconditionally instead. The call is idempotent, it costs 0.1 ms,
    and it is what the product itself does at all three of its call sites.
