"""Tests for the changelog mirror guard.

``scripts/check_changelog_mirror.py`` exists because the two changelogs drift
silently, so the thing worth testing is that it goes red in BOTH directions. A
guard that only notices the markdown running ahead is half a guard, and the half
it is missing is the one that fires when somebody writes the in-app card first,
which is the order a frontend change is usually made in.

The cases below therefore come in pairs. Every failure case has a mirror with
the two files swapped, and the message is asserted by the name of the file that
is behind rather than by a substring of the whole output, so a copy-paste that
names the wrong side fails here instead of pointing a future reader at the file
that was already correct.

One case is deliberately green: two changelogs that lead with the same release
but disagree about releases below ``FULL_COMPARISON_FLOOR``. That is the real
tree, where the markdown carries 387 releases and the component 297 and every
one of the 142 divergences sits below 10.0.0, and a guard that failed on it
would be turned off within a day.

The floor is therefore the one number in the guard that a test has to pin from
both sides. ``TestTheFloor`` holds a hole exactly on it, which must fail, beside
a hole exactly below it, which must pass, in both directions, so neither a ``>``
written for a ``>=`` nor a floor nudged by one release can pass here.
