/**
 * API helpers for the Currency / FX register.
 *
 * Backed by /api/v1/fx/ — see backend/app/modules/fx/router.py. Every path
 * below carries its trailing slash because the routes are declared with one.
 *
 * Rates and money arrive as plain-decimal **strings**, not numbers. The backend
 * serialises Decimals that way on purpose: a rate is stored at ten decimal
 * places precisely because six loses about one percent of an inverse rate
 * against a weak currency, and a JSON float would hand that back. They stay
 * strings here, and are parsed only where one has to be compared or inverted —
 * see fxRates.ts, which is the only place that does arithmetic on one.
 *
 * `POST /revalue/` is the one endpoint not wired. It splits a movement into the
 * part caused by scope and the part caused by the rate, over a list of figures
 * the caller supplies; its input is a commitment register, not three fields on
 * a form, so it belongs on a cost report rather than here.
