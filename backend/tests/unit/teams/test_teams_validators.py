"""The six ``teams`` validation rules, each on a project that actually trips it.

Each rule gets a positive case (a clean project it stays quiet on) and a
negative case (a misconfiguration it names). The clean case is what stops a
rule that never fires from looking like a rule that passes.

The snapshot collector is exercised through the rules rather than separately:
if it read the wrong rows, the counts asserted below would not line up.
