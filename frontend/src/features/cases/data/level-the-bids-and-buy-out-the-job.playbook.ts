// Case: "Level the bids and buy out the job" (US).
//
// The objection is "our spreadsheet process has worked for years", and it has.
// The answer is not migration. Subcontractor bids arrive as spreadsheets and
// PDFs on bid day and always will, so the case takes them in that form and
// spends its effort on the part a spreadsheet is genuinely bad at: holding
// several bids against one scope and carrying the chosen one into a commitment
// without retyping it.
//
// The US-specific weight is bid day itself, and the leveling sheet that comes
// out of it. Scope gaps between bidders are priced rather than argued, and the
// award has to survive the buyout that follows it. Terminology is en-US
// throughout: bidders, leveling, scope gaps, buyout, commitment. Content
// strings are key plus inline English default and live only here.

    "Bid day works on spreadsheets because spreadsheets are what arrive, and no estimator is going to ask fourteen subcontractors to learn a portal the week of a bid. So this case does not replace the spreadsheet, it takes it as input. What it replaces is the part that fails quietly: three bids that look comparable because they are all one number, where one excluded the hoisting, one carried the permit and one priced a different specification section, and the cheapest turns out to be the most expensive by the time it is bought out. Leveling makes the exclusions visible while there is still time to price them, and the award carries into the subcontract as the same document rather than as a fresh transcription with fresh typos.",
