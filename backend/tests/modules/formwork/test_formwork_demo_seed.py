"""The demo seeder must name systems the catalogue actually ships.

``seed_demo_formwork`` picks its systems out of the catalogue BY NAME, and a
name it cannot find is skipped with a debug log rather than an error. That is
the right behaviour at runtime - one renamed catalogue row should not fail a
whole demo install - but it means a rename silently empties the demo project
instead of breaking anything loudly. The formwork page would go back to being
the empty screen that started this work, and every test would still pass.

So the coupling gets its own gate here. These tests need no database: both
sides are module-level constants.
