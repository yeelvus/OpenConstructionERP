"""A cluster written by another PostgreSQL major is named, not just refused.

PostgreSQL will not open a data directory that a different major version wrote,
in either direction. Until this guard existed the code read only whether
``PG_VERSION`` was *present*, which answers "does initdb still have to run" and
says nothing about compatibility, so a user whose cluster predated a PostgreSQL
bump got the postmaster's raw refusal after three retries, wrapped in advice to
reinstall - the very act that had caused it - and the only recovery anyone could
name was ``init-db --reset``, which deletes the cluster.

These tests drive the pure check against a temporary directory with the bundled
version stubbed, so they need no cluster, cannot disturb the session's own, and
cannot skip: a test that only runs where the real PostgreSQL binaries are
installed would be absent exactly on the machines this guard is written for.
