        A page with no readable ``sheet_number`` is never chained. There is no

        every unreadable page in the project into one bogus history.

        A number carried by two pages of the SAME upload is a fault in the
        drawing set, not something to resolve by guessing. The earlier page
        takes the link, the predecessor retires because this upload does
        supersede it, and the later page stays current and unlinked. The
        register then shows two current rows for that number, which is the
        truth about the file that was uploaded. It is logged, because the
        alternative is that it looks like our duplication rather than theirs.

        Nothing is deleted and nothing is overwritten. A retired row keeps every
        column it had and only stops being current.
