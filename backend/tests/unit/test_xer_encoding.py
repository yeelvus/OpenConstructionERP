"""A P6 export never says which code page it is in, so we have to be right anyway.

The defect these tests pin is not a crash. Decoding a cp1256 export as Latin-1
raises nothing, logs nothing and stores every Arabic activity name as mojibake,
so the only evidence is on the Gantt chart weeks later. A test that merely
asserts "the import succeeded" is exactly the test that was already passing.

Every language case therefore asserts the round trip: bytes encoded in a real
code page come back as the string that went in. And two cases go the other way,
because a decoder that answered "Arabic" to everything would satisfy the four
language tests on its own: a Western file has to stay Western, and text that is
valid UTF-8 has to stay UTF-8.
