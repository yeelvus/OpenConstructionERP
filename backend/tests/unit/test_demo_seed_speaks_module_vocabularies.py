"""No seeded record may hold a value its own module would refuse.

Four modules have now been caught doing exactly that: contacts on
``contact_type``, variations on its status vocabulary, safety on four fields at
once, and contracts on ``counterparty_type``, where the seed wrote "contractor"
against a module that offers client and subcontractor and a picker that offers
the same two. Four instances is a class, so this checks every module rather than
waiting for the fifth to be reported.

The mechanism behind the class is that the seeder builds ORM rows directly. It
never passes the Pydantic layer that owns the vocabulary, and the columns behind
these fields are plain ``String`` with no enum, so the database accepts anything.
What reaches the screen is then a value the create endpoint would 422, the edit
form cannot re-select, and any filter built from the real vocabulary cannot find.

Three notes on the method, each of which cost a wrong answer to learn.

A regex over the seed source does not work. Auditing safety that way reported
"workmanship" and "supervision" as severities; both are NCR fields sitting a few
lines from the incident block. Values are read out of ``ast`` dict literals here,
never out of raw text.

A field name is not enough to identify a vocabulary. ``priority`` is a task field
and a punchlist field with different scales, and "critical" is legal in the
second and refused by the first; ``status`` belongs to nearly every module. Each
literal is therefore attributed to a schema by how much of its key set that
schema covers, and judged only against the vocabulary of the module it was
attributed to.

Constraints are read from ``model_fields`` rather than parsed from source,
because several are built from a module-level constant - contracts writes
``rf"^({COUNTERPARTY_TYPES})$"`` - and only the resolved pattern states the
actual vocabulary.

What this cannot see, measured rather than assumed. Reintroducing all four of the
defects above, it catches the contracts and tasks ones and misses the safety one,
because the safety values live in a tuple pool that a generator reads rather than
in a dict literal. That measurement predates both the table resolution below and
the shape and value split, either of which may have narrowed it, and it has not
been repeated, so read it as a floor on the blindness rather than a description
of it. Either way it is the division of labour with
``test_demo_safety_vocabulary.py``, which calls the generator and validates real
schema objects: this file is wide and shallow across every module, that one is
narrow and deep on the module where it mattered. A module whose seed is generated
rather than written needs the second kind.

The floors below exist so that a change which quietly drops the attribution rate
to zero fails instead of passing, because a comparison over nothing passes. Of
1642 dict literals in the seed sources, 895 are readable as records and 401
attribute to a schema that states a vocabulary; the rest are configuration and
nested fragments that are not records at all. Counted 18.08 by walking every
``ast.Dict`` in ``_seed_sources()`` and running ``_record_literals`` and
``_scan`` over them, not by reading the assertions. The first two rose from 752
and 352 when attribution moved onto the record's shape: a record whose other
fields are f-strings and calls used to fall under the floor and be dropped
whole, which is how a seeded submittal type outside its own vocabulary reached
every generated project with this file green.

A floor sitting far under the real number stops being a floor. These were set
when 143 records attributed and 143 was already the number after a defect that
silenced hundreds of them, which is how a scan reading a third of the seed went
on passing for months. They are now set close enough to bite.

# Read as constants only, that record is empty - every value is a name - so it
# falls under _MIN_SHARED_KEYS and is dropped. The scan never compared a single
# snag row against the punchlist vocabulary. It did not pass a bad value, it
# read no values at all, and the floors above cannot show that: one silent
# record among hundreds does not move a total. The gap was found from the
# outside, on a screen printing a raw category the module does not define.
#
# So a name is resolved to the column of the table it is bound to, and the field
# then carries the set of values that position can hold rather than a single
# value. The resolution is deliberately narrow: an enclosing ``for``, a target
# the name appears in, and an iterable that is a literal table or a name bound
# exactly once to one, in the same scope. Anything computed - a call, a
# comprehension, a name assigned in two places - resolves to nothing and the
# field is left out exactly as before. A guessed value would be reported against
# a module that never receives it, and a false accusation in a gate is worse
# than the blindness it replaces.
#
# One shape that looks covered and is not: a name assigned inside the loop body
# rather than bound by the loop. ``status = ("open", "in_progress",
# "resolved")[i % 3]`` sits two lines above the punch record, and the record
# reads the name, so the pool stays behind an assignment this does not follow
# and the field is dropped. Written inline in the record the same pool is read.
# Nothing hangs on it today, because punchlist states a status vocabulary only
# on its transition schema, but the limit is real and belongs written down next
# to the shape it resembles.
