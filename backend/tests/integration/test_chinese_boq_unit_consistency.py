"""Unit-system consistency has to reach a Chinese bill of quantities.

``BOQUnitSystemConsistencyRule`` reads ``data["project_unit_system"]``, and that
value comes from whichever regional pack claims the project's country. A market
no pack claims resolves to ``None``, and on ``None`` the rule returns an empty
list: no result, no finding, no exit code. That silence is indistinguishable
from a bill with no unit problems, which is the whole reason these tests exist.

China was such a market. The rule's unit vocabulary already carried the words a
GB 50500 bill writes - 平方米, 立方米, 米 - so the vocabulary looked done, but no
pack declared ``"CN"``, so the rule never ran on a Chinese project at all and
the vocabulary was unreachable. Reading the vocabulary alone could not tell the
two apart, so these tests go through ``ValidationModuleService.run_validation``
against committed rows: a regression that unhooks the pack makes them fail,
while a test that assembled a ``ValidationContext`` by hand would pass either
way.

The check is directional, which decides what each case here proves. The rule
compares a bill's units against the set for the system the project is *not* in.
So on a Chinese project - metric - it is the imperial vocabulary that gets
read, and a Chinese bill is protected by the imperial words, not by the metric
ones. The metric words matter in the other direction, on an imperial project
carrying a Chinese row. Both directions are covered below, because a suite that
only tested one of them would report a vocabulary as protecting a market it
never touches.
