"""Catalog API routes.

The catalog stores **resources** - single-input items (one material, one
labour rate, one machine, etc.) with one price per region. Resources do
not have a material/labour/equipment breakdown because each resource
*already is* one of those - the kind is in ``resource_type``.

Resources are referenced by **cost positions** (work compositions) in
``oe_costs_item``, exposed at ``/api/v1/costs/``. A position's
``components[]`` array names the resources it consumes by ``code`` and
adds quantity / unit-rate / cost. So:

    /api/v1/costs/         - work positions (≈55k canonical, more with
                             regional price variants). The "work items"
                             you see referenced in legacy CSV columns
                             *are* these.
    /api/v1/catalog/       - leaf resources with prices. Each maps to
                             zero or more cost positions via the
                             ``components[].code`` field.

Use ``/api/v1/catalog/{resource_id}/used-by/`` to walk the relation in
the resource→positions direction (the inverse of ``components[]``).

Endpoints:
    GET  /           -- Search/list catalog resources (public, query params)
    GET  /stats      -- Counts by type and category
    GET  /regions    -- List loaded catalog regions with counts
    POST /import/{region} -- Download catalog from GitHub and import
    DELETE /region/{region} -- Remove all resources for a region
    PATCH /adjust-prices -- Bulk price adjustment by factor
    GET  /{resource_id}            -- Get single resource by ID
    GET  /{resource_id}/used-by/   -- Cost positions that reference this resource
    POST /           -- Create a custom resource (auth required)
    POST /extract    -- Extract resources from cost items (admin)
