"""diary_labour_published: mark the entries whose hours already reached cost.

Diary work hours used to be handed to the labour cost flow when the entry was
submitted. Submitting says the worker has finished writing, not that anyone has
checked what they wrote, and these hours land straight on a budget line's
``actual_amount``. They now go out on approval instead, which is the rule the
desktop timesheet has always had.

That move needs a mark, otherwise every entry already submitted under the old
behaviour would publish a second time the moment somebody approved it. The
project would then carry those hours twice with nothing on screen to explain
the difference, and the first approval a user ever performed would be the thing
that broke their numbers.

``oe_field_diary_entry.labour_published_at`` is that mark, backfilled from
``submitted_at`` for every entry that reached ``submitted`` or ``approved``.
Under the old code reaching either status is exactly what published the hours,
so the backfill is a statement of what already happened rather than a guess.
Entries still in ``draft`` never published and stay null.

An entry with no ``submitted_at`` but a submitted status is stamped with
``approved_at`` and failing that with ``updated_at``, because the mark only has
to be non-null to mean "already counted" - the timestamp is for a human reading
the row later.
