// Case: "Report a DIN 276 cost plan to the client" (DE).
//
// A German cost-consultant case: set the early cost frame, code every bill
// position to its DIN 276 Kostengruppe, let the cost spine build the plan as a
// tree of cost groups, check that nothing is left unclassified, read the
// variance group by group and issue the plan to the Bauherr in the structure
// their auditor reads. Content strings are key plus inline English default and
// live only here.
