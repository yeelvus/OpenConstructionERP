"""Report which published releases carry which signature, for all four mechanisms.

"Signed" is not one property of a release. This project has four independent
mechanisms, they are produced by different jobs, they protect different things,
and a release can carry any subset of them:

    1. git tag object signature   the tag itself, GPG or SSH, verifiable with
                                  `git tag -v`. Says who cut the tag.
    2. Sigstore / cosign          a detached signature over a SHA256SUMS
                                  manifest of the published assets, produced by
                                  release-signing.yml. Says these are the bytes
                                  we shipped.
    3. macOS Developer ID         codesign with a Developer ID certificate plus
       and notarisation           Apple notarisation and a stapled ticket. What
                                  Gatekeeper accepts without a warning.
    4. Windows Authenticode       a certificate on the .exe and .msi. What
                                  SmartScreen reads.

The reason this script exists rather than a table in a document: the table went
stale the moment it was written, and a stale inventory of guarantees is worse
than none, because it is quoted. The document states the rule and carries the
command; this produces the numbers on demand.

What is measured and what is not, stated plainly because the difference is the
whole point:

    Mechanism 1 is measured, locally, from the tag objects in this clone. It
    cannot be measured from the GitHub API at all: the releases endpoint says
    nothing about tag objects, so a run that only talked to the API would
    report "nothing missing" for the mechanism where everything is missing.

    Mechanism 2 is measured from the published asset list. The three assets
    either exist on the release or they do not.

    Mechanisms 3 and 4 are NOT derivable from an asset list. A .dmg is a .dmg
    whether or not it is notarised, and nothing in its name or size says. So by
    default they are answered from the credentials: no Developer ID certificate
    and no notarisation credentials means no build could have been notarised,
    and no AZURE_KV_* secrets means no installer could have been Authenticode
    signed. That is an argument from the cause rather than an observation of
    the effect, and it is labelled as such everywhere it appears.

    An argument from the cause has one weakness worth naming, because it is the
    weakness that matters for a claim about the past: the secret list is read
    NOW. A credential that is absent today may have existed a month ago and
    been deleted since, and nothing in the current configuration would show it.
    So "no release has ever carried this" does not follow from "the secret is
    not configured" on its own.

    --check-artifacts closes that for Windows by measuring the published bytes.
    An Authenticode signature is appended to a PE file, but the pointer to it
    sits in the optional header's data directory, entry 4, so an 8 KB range
    request per installer settles the question without downloading any payload.
    Size zero there means unsigned. There is no equivalent for macOS from a
    non-Mac host, so mechanism 3 remains an argument from the cause and says so.

Usage::

    python scripts/release_signature_inventory.py            # summary
    python scripts/release_signature_inventory.py --all      # every release
    python scripts/release_signature_inventory.py --json     # machine readable
    python scripts/release_signature_inventory.py --check-artifacts   # read the
                                                             # published bytes

Needs the `gh` CLI, authenticated. Run from anywhere inside a clone.

Exit codes:
    0  the inventory was produced
    1  the inventory could not be trusted (short fetch, gh missing, and under
       --strict, any mechanism that could not be measured)

# A credential is "wired" when the step that runs the signing TOOL receives it,

# APPLE_* secrets in order to report that they are absent, and a detector that
# grepped for the names read that as "notarisation is configured" - the exact
# false claim the status step exists to prevent. So each mechanism is tied to
# the step that consumes it, identified by the action it uses or the command it
# runs, and only that step's env is inspected.
#
# (uses-prefix, invoked command, alternative credential sets the tool accepts)

# "azuresigntool" anywhere in a step picked out the preflight step, whose
