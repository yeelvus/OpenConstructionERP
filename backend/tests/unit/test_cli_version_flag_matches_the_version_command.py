"""``--version`` must answer, and answer the same thing the subcommand does.

``openconstructionerp --version`` used to exit 2 with "unrecognized arguments"
because the only spelling wired up was the ``version`` subcommand. It is the
first thing most people type at a tool they have just installed, so the first
thing the tool said to them was an argparse error.

The flag now hands the work to ``cmd_version``, and these tests are what keeps
it that way: they run the CLI both ways in a real process and compare the whole
report, so a change that touches one spelling and not the other fails here
rather than in front of a new user.

The version string is pinned to ``backend/pyproject.toml`` rather than to
``importlib.metadata``. That is deliberate and it is the same rule
``test_cli_version_matches_the_running_code`` enforces: the metadata reports
whatever distribution happens to be installed in the environment, which on a
source checkout that has ever seen ``pip install openconstructionerp`` is not
the code being executed. Measured on the machine this was written on, the
metadata said 14.6.0 while the tree said 16.1.0. Asserting against it would
encode the exact bug ``_resolve_version`` exists to prevent.
