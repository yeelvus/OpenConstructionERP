"""Creating a requirement has to leave something a response can be built from.

Both write routes in this module answered with a server error. The cause was
not in either route: ``create`` and ``bulk_create`` add a row and flush it, and
a flush is not a load, so the ``selectin`` collections and every column the
insert did not name came back unloaded. The response schema then read
``linked_position_ids``, which reads ``position_links``, which asked the
database for rows from inside a synchronous property on an asynchronous
session. That cannot emit IO from where it is standing, so it raised, and both
routes turned the raise into a 500.

What makes this worth pinning rather than patching is that no test could see
it. The suite's own helpers call ``session.refresh`` after creating a row, and
a refresh is a load, so every fixture-built requirement was fully populated and
every assertion about one passed. Only a row created the way the service
creates one is in the failing state.

These assert the response path itself - the same ``model_validate`` the router
runs - rather than the exception type, because pydantic wraps the failure and a
test that named the inner error would pass for the wrong reason.
