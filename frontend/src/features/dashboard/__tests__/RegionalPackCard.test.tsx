/**
 * Where the card's way into the pack picker lands, in both of its states.
 *
 * WHY THE DESTINATION IS TESTED AND NOT THE CLICK. This card's empty state
 * pointed its only button at `/onboarding`, and the wizard mounted there
 * bounces anyone with `oe_onboarding_completed` straight back to `/` with
 * `replace`. Every reader who can see a dashboard has that flag, so the
 * button did nothing for all of them - and a test that asserted the button
 * renders, or that clicking it calls navigate, would have been green through
 * the whole life of the defect. Both facts it needed were true: there WAS a
 * button and it DID navigate. So these tests never look at the call, they
 * follow the navigation through a real router and ask what is on screen at
 * the end of it, with the flag set the way a real reader's browser has it.
 *
 * WHY THE GUARD IS IN THE HARNESS. The `/onboarding` route here carries the
 * wizard's own `isOnboardingCompleted`, imported from the onboarding feature
 * rather than restated, so a test that passes is a test whose guard reads the
 * same storage key the wizard reads. The first case exists to prove that
 * guard is live: it walks a control button into `/onboarding` and watches it
 * come back to `/`. Without it, a harness that had quietly stopped bouncing
 * would make every later assertion green for the wrong reason.
 *
 * WHY THE FLAG IS ASSERTED AFTER THE CLICK. There is a way to make the
 * wizard reachable from here - remove the completed flag first, the way
 * Settings' "restart onboarding" does. It would pass a naive destination
 * test and silently restart a finished user's setup, which is worse than the
 * dead button. So the flag is asserted intact on the way out.
 *
 * Run: npx vitest run src/features/dashboard/__tests__/RegionalPackCard.test.tsx
