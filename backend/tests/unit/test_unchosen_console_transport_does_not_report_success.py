"""A console transport nobody chose must not report a successful delivery.

``test_email_configuration_diagnosis.py`` next door pins the case where an
operator filled in every ``SMTP_*`` variable and left ``EMAIL_BACKEND`` alone.
This file pins the quieter one underneath it: an operator who set *nothing*
about email at all.

That deployment gets ``email_backend='console'`` because that is the field
default, and the console transport answers every send with
``DeliveryResult.success``. There is no failed-delivery log line, no error
returned to the caller, and no counter that moves, so the population who never
received their password reset cannot be named even afterwards. A measured
install ran that way for ten days.

The distinction the whole file rests on is between an operator who *wrote*
``EMAIL_BACKEND=console`` - a supported choice, see ``console.py`` on
air-gapped installs and compliance freezes - and one who wrote nothing.
``model_fields_set`` is the only thing that separates them: both produce the
same ``email_backend`` value, so any check reading the value alone answers
identically for the two and settles nothing.

Every ``Settings`` here passes ``_env_file=None`` for the reason the
neighbouring file gives, and the unchosen cases additionally assert that
``email_backend`` really is absent from ``model_fields_set``. Without that
assertion a stray ``EMAIL_BACKEND`` in the runner's environment would quietly
turn the two controls into the same test, which is exactly the failure this
file exists to prevent.
