"""The provenance type must refuse to describe the defects it was built for.

Every assertion here that a construction *succeeds* would also pass against a
plain dataclass with no validation at all, so those carry no weight on their
own. The load-bearing tests are the ones that assert a raise, and each is
written from a defect that actually shipped:

* a config endpoint answering "these are CA's phone rules" about the generic
  ones, which is ``DECLARED`` with the requested and used codes differing;
* a calendar endpoint labelling a Canadian project "Standard", which is the same
  lie with the fields swapped;
* a holiday calculation raising, being swallowed into an empty set, and every
  day of the year becoming a working day, which is ``UNAVAILABLE`` being treated
  as an answer.
