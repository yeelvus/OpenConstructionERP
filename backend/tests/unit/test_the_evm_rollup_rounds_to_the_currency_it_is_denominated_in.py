"""The scalar EVM rollup rounds money to the currency it is denominated in.

``app.core.money.money_quantum`` is the platform's single value-layer resolver
for how many decimals an amount really has. Two surfaces in the schedule module
compute earned value over the same activities:

* the 4D dashboard, through ``service_4d._q_money``, which asks the resolver;
* ``GET /schedules/{id}/evm-summary/``, through ``evm_math.compute_evm_summary``,
  which used a fixed four-decimal quantum and never asked anything.

So one schedule answered two different numbers depending on which endpoint was
asked, and a yen came back with four decimals nothing in Japan can settle.
``compute_evm_summary`` now takes the quantum from its caller. ``evm_math`` is
deliberately free of ORM and app imports and cannot resolve a currency itself,
which is why the argument is a quantum and not a currency code; the router
resolves it through ``money_quantum`` and these tests do the same, so a drift
between the resolver and this module fails here rather than in production.

Only the *value* layer is under test. What a screen prints and what an invoice
declares are decided elsewhere (see the three-layer note in ``app.core.money``).
