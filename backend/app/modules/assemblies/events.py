"""Assemblies event subscribers​‌‍⁠​‌‍⁠​‌‍⁠​‌‍⁠ - keep total_rate fresh.

Without this subscriber, ``Assembly.total_rate`` was a denormalised
string snapshot computed once at component create/update/delete time.
When a ``CostItem.rate`` changed externally via the costs module,
every Assembly that referenced it carried a stale unit_cost on its
Components and a stale total_rate on the parent - and any BOQ
position created from the assembly inherited the stale value
forever.

The subscriber listens for ``costs.item.updated``, finds every
Component whose ``cost_item_id`` matches the updated item, refreshes
the component's ``unit_cost`` + ``total`` from the new rate, and then
re-runs the assembly total math on each parent assembly so the
denormalised total stays in sync.

This is the "additive" cost-flow direction - assemblies stay
synchronised with the cost database without the BOQ positions
already created from them having to be hand-rebuilt.  Positions
created BEFORE the rate change are NOT touched (they're locked
financial commitments at create time); the next regenerate of the
position from the assembly picks up the new rate naturally.
