"""Pure computation core for on-site material metering and stock.

Materials arrive on site (a goods receipt), get installed against a BoQ position
(consumption), are lost to breakage or theft (waste / shrinkage), or move between
storage locations (transfer). This module turns a flat list of such movements
into the numbers a site engineer and a cost controller need: stock on hand,
inventory turnover and days-on-hand, the waste ratio, and the material-cost
variance of what was actually consumed against what the estimate budgeted per
position.

Everything here is a plain value object plus a set of functions. It is
``Decimal``-exact and carries no ORM, database or FastAPI dependency, exactly
like :mod:`app.modules.postcalc.model`, so the whole core is trivially
constructed and asserted from plain values. The DB loaders that build
:class:`Movement` lists and the per-position budgets live in
:mod:`app.modules.site_inventory.service`.

Sign convention for stock on hand (the signed sum of movements):

* ``INBOUND``      adds to stock (+quantity)
* ``CONSUMPTION``  removes from stock (-quantity)
* ``WASTE``        removes from stock (-quantity)
* ``TRANSFER``     nets to zero for the whole project (material only relocates);
                   for a single location it is -quantity at the source and
                   +quantity at the destination.

Money is never a float: quantities and unit costs are :class:`decimal.Decimal`
throughout and every division is guarded, returning ``None`` rather than raising
when the denominator is zero.
