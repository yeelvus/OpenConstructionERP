"""Defects-liability validation rules (limitation of defect claims).

The module exists for one sentence, and it is this one: **a warranty period that
names a legal regime and then disagrees with it is reported, never corrected.**
Under the VOB/B the default period for building works is four years and under the
BGB it is five, and a contract is free to agree something else again. So a record
saying "VOB/B" beside a five-year period is either a contract that agreed five
years or a mistake that will cost a claim, and only a person knows which. The
rules name the provision, both numbers and the difference, and leave the record
alone.

Rules, both registered under the ``defects_liability`` rule set:

* ``defects_liability.limitation_period_matches_regime`` - WARNING. The entry
  names a regime and carries a period, and the two say different things. This is
  the one above. Reported for the stored month count and for the stored end date
  separately, because an entry can disagree on either.
* ``defects_liability.limitation_regime_needs_start_date`` - WARNING. The entry
  names a regime but records no Abnahme date, so the period it claims to follow
  cannot be counted at all.

Both are WARNING rather than ERROR on purpose. A period that departs from the
statutory default is lawful where the contract agreed it, so a finding here is
something a person answers, not something that blocks a save. Nothing in this
module ever writes.

**Silence is the whole design for everyone else.** Every rule returns an empty
list the moment it sees no regime on the entry. A register whose entries never
chose a regime therefore produces no findings at all, not even passing ones - it
gets no column, no badge and no nag, because the rules have nothing to say about
a date nobody claimed a reason for. That is checked directly by the tests rather
than left to be true by accident.

Findings are English prose naming the provision, which is the platform's settled
convention for rule messages (see
:mod:`app.modules.payment_clock.validators`); the reader's language happens on
the screen.

Every rule reads a plain dict built by
:func:`app.modules.defects_liability.service.limitation_snapshot`, so the rules
run against a fixture with no database at all.
