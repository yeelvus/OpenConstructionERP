"""A per-currency variations breakdown is written in each currency's units.

``variations.service._money_str_map`` turns a ``{code: Decimal}`` map into the
wire format the dashboard reads. It is keyed by currency code, which is the
whole reason it exists: the scalar totals beside it are single-currency, and
this map is what a project running variations in more than one currency has
instead. It quantised every value in it to two decimals.

So it was wrong in exactly the place its own purpose lies. A forint entry came
back carrying fillér that left circulation in 1999, a Kuwaiti dinar entry came
back a fils short, and the two sat in one dictionary next to a euro entry that
was right, which is the arrangement most likely to make a reader trust all
three. That is not a missed edge case, it is the function contradicting the
reason it was written.

Four response fields are rendered through it, ``cost_impact_by_currency``,
``cost_impact_unconverted_by_currency``, ``daywork_value_by_currency`` and
``daywork_value_unconverted_by_currency``, and none of them had a test of any
kind before this file.
