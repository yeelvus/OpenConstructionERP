// valueGuide - "How it works" content for the Value Realized dashboard.
// Consumed by <ModuleGuideButton content={valueGuide} /> on ValueDashboardPage.
//
// i18n: every key carries its inline English default and is read via
// t(key, { defaultValue }). The keys are not in en.ts, the inline defaults
// are the English source; their translations live in the other locale files,
// so a changed default needs its translations redone too. No spotlight
// selectors are set because the page exposes no stable data-testid hooks, so
// each card renders centred.
