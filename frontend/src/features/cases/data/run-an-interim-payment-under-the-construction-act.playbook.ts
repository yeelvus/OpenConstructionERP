// Case: "Run an interim payment under the Construction Act" (GB).
//
// The statutory sequence, run once end to end: due date, payment notice, pay
// less notice, final date, and the section 111 consequence of missing one.
// The point of the case is that the sum payable is derived from the notices
// that were actually served, not from the valuation everybody remembers.

    "The Housing Grants, Construction and Regeneration Act 1996, as amended by the 2009 Act, gives every construction contract in Britain a payment timetable, and the sequence is the whole of it. There is a due date, a payment notice five days after it, a pay less notice up to seven days before the final date, and the final date itself. Section 111 is what gives it teeth: the notified sum must be paid in full by the final date unless a valid pay less notice was served in time, and where the payer served no payment notice at all, the sum the payee applied for becomes the notified sum. This case runs one interim application through that sequence so the deadlines are known before they pass rather than reconstructed from emails afterwards.",
