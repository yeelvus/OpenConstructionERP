"""The demo estate must not stamp a progress claim at a time that has not come.

``seed_contracts_demo`` limits a claim to ``today`` and then lays a business
hour on top of it, so an installation seeded at 07:30 UTC wrote claims
submitted at 10:00 UTC the same morning. Nothing in the product objects to a
timestamp in the future, and the register renders it without comment, so the
only thing that ever caught it was an assertion in the PostgreSQL suite that
fires on the wall clock of the machine running it: green after ten in the
morning, red before, and read as a flake either way.

These tests do not depend on the time of day. The first pins the clamp with a
day that is in the future no matter when it runs, and the second pins the other
side of it, because a clamp that simply returned ``now`` for everything would
pass the first test while flattening the whole history of the ladder into one
instant.
