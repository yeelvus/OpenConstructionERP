          warning so the buyer can still raise the PO with eyes open.
        * an expired / revoked / missing required compliance document. Same
          treatment as prequal: a warning, not a block. A purchase order that
          succeeded yesterday and 409s today because a certificate lapsed
          overnight is an interface change, and the subcontract-award and
          payment gates - which are what "award" means - already hard-block on

        Expiry is judged as at ``date.today()``, server-local, which is the

        One clock convention across the three gates matters more than which
        one: two gates disagreeing about whether a document had lapsed on a
        given day would be worse than either answer being off by an offset.

    #
    # A purchase order is a commercial document, so "get rid of it" is three
    # operations, not one, and which applies is decided by what the document
    # has already done rather than by who is asking:
    #
    # * a draft PO that never left draft and that nothing points at may be
    #   DELETED. Budget commits at ``approved``, so such a PO has no finance
    #   marker to compensate, no audit trail hanging off it and no number any
    #   supplier has seen. This is the duplicate, the mistyped one, the row
    #   somebody opened by accident.
    # * a PO that has been approved or issued is CANCELLED. The row stays, the
    #   ``po_number`` stays, the status becomes ``cancelled`` and the reason is
    #   recorded. The number is what the supplier quotes and a gap in the
    #   sequence is what an auditor asks about, so it is never reused and never
    #   reclaimed.
    # * a PO that goods receipts, payable invoices, retainage releases or
    #   requisitions point at is REFUSED, 409, naming every holder by kind and
    #   count. Deleting it would take an audit trail with it; cancelling it
    #   would void a commitment that other records are still measuring
    #   themselves against.
    #
    # A PO that has been delivered against and now has to stop is closed, not
    # voided: the FSM already allows ``issued -> completed`` and
    # ``partially_received -> completed``, which records that the order ended
    # where it ended. Cancelling would claim it never happened.

        Takes a row-level write lock on the PO first, so the count and the
        removal that follows it are one critical section. Without the lock this
        is a read followed by a write: the counts come back empty, a goods
        receipt is inserted against the PO, and the delete then CASCADEs it away
        without an error - ``GoodsReceipt.po_id`` and ``PORetainageRelease.po_id``
        are both ``ondelete="CASCADE"``, so the database would not object, and a
        retainage release is money already paid out.

        What the lock buys, precisely. ``FOR UPDATE`` on the PO row conflicts
        with the ``FOR KEY SHARE`` that PostgreSQL's referential-integrity
        trigger takes on a parent row when a child carrying a foreign key to it
        is inserted. So a concurrent insert of a goods receipt, a retainage
        release or a material requisition either blocks until this transaction
        ends, or committed before the lock was granted and is therefore visible
        to the counts below. Both outcomes are correct; neither loses a row.

        Payable invoices are the exception that the database cannot cover:
        finance is an optional module and its ``Invoice`` carries no foreign
        key to a PO, only a ``metadata_["po_id"]`` stamp, so inserting one
        takes no lock on this row and no referential-integrity trigger fires.
        That kind is serialised by cooperation instead - the invoice-creation
        endpoint takes this same lock before it reads the PO, so whichever of
        the two transactions arrives second waits and then sees the other's
        committed result. If a second way to raise an invoice against a PO is
        ever added, it has to take the lock too; nothing in the schema will
        enforce it the way it does for the three kinds above.

        The lock is taken here rather than in each caller so that no removal
        door can be added later that counts without it - the same reasoning
        that put the guard itself in one place and called it from all three.
        Re-taking it in a transaction that already holds it is a no-op, so a
        caller that locks earlier for its own reasons costs nothing.
