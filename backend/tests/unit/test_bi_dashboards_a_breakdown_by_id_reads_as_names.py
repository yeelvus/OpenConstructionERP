"""A breakdown keyed by an id has to say what each id is - issue #441.

Grouping a custom KPI by ``boq_id`` is how the reporter asked for a number
per bid, and it is the only way to ask: the group key is what the database
can group by. What comes back is then keyed by a uuid, and a column of
uuids is not an answer to "how does each of my estimates score". The name
was reachable - ``label_field: boq_name`` - but only by an author who
already knew the field existed, and the whole point of the whitelist is
that nobody should have to know that.

Three things are pinned here.

* The catalog declares which field names an id, and a spec that groups by
  that id and asks for no label gets that name written into it when the
  definition is created. Written at creation, not applied at compute: a
  definition already stored keeps whatever shape it was created with, and
  the author can read back what they got and change it.
* A name that is blank is not a name. ``boq_name`` is NOT NULL and still
  arrives empty, because ``BOQCreate`` checks ``min_length=1`` before the
  HTML sanitiser runs and a name of ``<script>x</script>`` sanitises to
  ``''``. An empty label renders as nothing at all, which reads as a
  broken row rather than as an estimate nobody named, so it takes the same
  reserved key as an absent group and the consumer localises it.
* The drill-down carries the name beside the id. Every custom KPI lands in
  the synthesised-record path - a spec has no registered record provider -
  so that path is the drill-down a custom KPI actually shows, and it was
  emitting the uuid as the record's key with the name buried inside its
  value.

Test isolation: a transaction-isolated PostgreSQL session on the shared
schema-loaded ``oe_test_unit`` database, rolled back on teardown.
