"""Every risk row a demo pack seeds has to fit the column it is written to.

The catalogue is a promise: a project a user can pick from the list has to
install. One could not. ``it-park-bangalore`` prices an Indian campus in INR,
the seed scored its risks on a cost-scaled formula, and the eleven-character
result did not fit ``RiskItem.risk_score``, which is a ``String(10)``.
PostgreSQL refused the INSERT, ``POST /api/demo/install/it-park-bangalore``
answered 500 with nothing written, and it did so every time, for as long as the
pack had shipped.

Nothing caught it because nothing compared what the seed writes with what the
column accepts. That comparison is this file. It walks the whole catalogue,
generates the risk rows each entry would seed, and measures every value against
the width declared on the model. The widths are read off ``RiskItem.__table__``
rather than repeated here, so a column narrowed tomorrow is measured at its new
width without anyone remembering to come back.

Two things keep this honest. The score comes from ``_seed_risk_score``, the
function ``install_demo_project`` itself calls, so a seed that goes back to
inventing its own scale fails here rather than in production. And the tuple is
unpacked by position, guarded on arity, so a generator that grows a field
breaks the test instead of quietly shifting every value one column across.

No database: ``_generate_module_data`` is a pure function of the template.
