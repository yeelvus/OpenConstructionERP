"""R7 DMS folder-permission tests.

Scope
-----
Per-folder ACL tests covering:

    1. Wrong-role gets 403 (viewer cannot write).
    2. Wrong-tenant / unknown user gets 404 (not 403 — don't leak existence).
    3. Owner always bypasses the ACL.
    4. Editor can write to an unscoped (open) folder.
    5. Viewer is denied write on a restricted folder.
    6. Wildcard grant (scope_path=None) covers every sub-path of that kind.
    7. More-specific grant beats the wildcard.
    8. ``folder_access_for`` returns ``None`` when a folder is restricted
       and the user has no matching grant (→ caller turns into 404).

All tests are pure-unit: repositories and the DB are fully stubbed.
``is_project_owner`` / ``is_project_member`` are patched to return
a deterministic answer so we don't need a real User table.
