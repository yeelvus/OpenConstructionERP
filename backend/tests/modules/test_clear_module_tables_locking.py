"""What ``clear_module_tables`` must do when somebody leaks a transaction.

The nightly cross-OS job used to die at 9% of the suite. The cause was not the
test that failed but the one after it: a fixture rebuilt the schema per test
with ``Base.metadata.drop_all``, DROP TABLE needs ACCESS EXCLUSIVE, and the
failing test had left a connection ``idle in transaction`` holding ACCESS SHARE
on one of those tables. No statement timeout covers a lock wait, so the drop
waited forever and the 900-second per-test timeout eventually killed the whole
process - taking the other 91% of the tree with it and printing no test name,
because pytest writes a node id without a trailing newline.

"The file passes now" would not prove that fixed: the file would also pass if
the failing assertion had simply stopped failing while the mechanism survived.
So these tests plant the leak deliberately and measure what the clear does
about it. Both hold a real lock from a second connection and assert on elapsed
time, which is the thing only the new mechanism can change.
