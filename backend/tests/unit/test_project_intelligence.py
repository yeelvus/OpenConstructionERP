"""Baseline tests for project_intelligence advisor and cross-project ACL.

Covers two correctness properties the module must hold:

1. ``generate_recommendations`` returns a structured insight derived from the
   project state and score, sourced from the LLM when one is configured. The
   LLM call must surface ``provider_intelligence.llm_call`` structured log
   records (tokens + duration + outcome) so cost is observable.

2. ``_verify_project_access`` blocks cross-project data leakage: a non-admin
   user requesting a project they do not own gets a 403, *before* any
   advisor / collector / scorer code runs. This guards every advisor entry
   point (recommendations, chat, explain-gap, actions).
