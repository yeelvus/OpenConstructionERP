"""Celery task definitions - RFC 34 §4 W0.1.

There is exactly one task: ``oe.dispatch_job``. Module-specific work
attaches via :func:`app.core.job_runner.register_handler`, NOT via
``@celery_app.task``. This keeps the worker entry point a single,
small, well-tested generic dispatcher.

The dispatcher loads the JobRun by id, looks up the handler registered
for ``JobRun.kind``, and invokes the lifecycle helpers in
:mod:`app.core.job_runner`. All persistence runs through SQLAlchemy
async sessions; the task body itself stays sync (Celery's contract)
and uses ``asyncio.run`` to bridge.

    ``_run_async_in_dedicated_thread`` gives every dispatch a brand-new
    event loop - a fresh ``asyncio.run()`` each time. ``base_factory`` is
    whatever ``_get_session_factory()`` currently resolves to (production,
    or a test's patched-in isolated database): an ``async_sessionmaker``
    bound to a pooled engine that outlives any single dispatch. A
    connection checked out on one loop and later reused from a *different*
    loop makes asyncpg raise ``RuntimeError: ... got Future ... attached to
    a different loop`` - deterministically from the second dispatch onward
    in any one worker process, since a connection returned to the pool at
    the end of one ``asyncio.run()`` is still sitting there, bound to a
    loop that no longer exists, when the next dispatch's loop starts.

    The fix builds a throwaway engine for this dispatch alone, pointed at
    the exact same database as ``base_factory`` (same URL, same
    localhost/SSL handling as ``app.database.create_engine_from_settings``)
    but with ``NullPool``, so no connection is ever held between checkouts
    to begin with - nothing can outlive the loop that opened it. Disposed
    in the ``finally`` below; under ``NullPool`` there is nothing left
    pooled to dispose of, but an explicit dispose keeps the engine's own
    bookkeeping tidy rather than relying on garbage collection for it.

    ``base_factory`` decides *which* database this dispatch talks to; this
    function only changes how connections to that database are pooled for
    the lifetime of one dispatch. It does not change what
    ``_dispatch_job_sync`` does with the session it is handed - only which
    engine that session comes from.

    test-only concern: eager mode (``task_always_eager = True``, the
    documented dev / lightweight-deployment default - see the stack
    table in the project CLAUDE.md) runs the task in-process on
    whatever thread called ``apply()``, and that thread is frequently
    the one driving the caller's own asyncio loop. A real, non-eager
    Celery worker thread usually has no loop of its own, so
    ``asyncio.run`` would work there without this helper - but this
    function does not special-case either mode. It always hands the
    coroutine to a brand-new thread, so the loop it runs on is always
    one this call created and nothing else could already be driving.

    That freshness is also why every dispatch is handed its own engine
    (see :func:`_dispatch_job_via_dedicated_engine`): a new loop here
    does not imply new connections unless the thing using it is built
