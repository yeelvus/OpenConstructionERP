"""The commit-subject guard rejects shell artefacts and nothing else.

Twelve published commits open with ``@`` before their real subject, one of them
the v14.6.0 release commit, because a PowerShell here-string opener was written
on the same line as ``git commit -m``. scripts/check_commit_subject.py exists to
stop the thirteenth.

Two things are worth testing and they pull in opposite directions. The guard has
to catch every shape the artefact takes, and it has to stay quiet on the ordinary
subjects that merely resemble one, because a guard that cries wolf on ``bump
@types/node`` gets disabled and then catches nothing at all.

The allowlist gets its own test. A list of exempt commits is only honest while
each entry still names a commit that really does carry the defect; once an entry
rots, the list is quietly suppressing something nobody has looked at.
