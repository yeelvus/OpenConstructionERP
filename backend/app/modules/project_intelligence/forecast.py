"""Predictive schedule and cost risk analytics (TOP-30 #19).

This module is a *deterministic, explainable* forecasting layer. It needs no
ML training data: every number is a closed-form Earned-Value or schedule-slip
formula, and every risk band is a fixed deterministic mapping. The product
philosophy is honoured throughout - analytics *suggest*, the human confirms;
every result carries a confidence score and a human-readable rationale, and
nothing here triggers an action.

Two layers live here:

* The **pure-logic helpers** (``compute_cost_forecast``, ``project_schedule_slip``,
  ``score_cost_overrun_risk``) operate on plain inputs (Decimals / ints) and are
  fully unit-testable without a database. They guard every division by zero and
  degrade gracefully when an input is missing.
* The :class:`ForecastService` reads from already-committed sibling modules
  (full_evm / finance EVM snapshot, schedule, risk) **read-only** and assembles
  a :class:`ProjectForecast`. It never writes - it does not duplicate the EVM
  math that persists forecast rows in ``full_evm.service``; it recomputes the
  same canonical formulas from the latest snapshot for a live, no-side-effect
  read.
