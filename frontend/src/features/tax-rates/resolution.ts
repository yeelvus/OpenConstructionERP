 * anything.
 *
 * Several of the server's statuses mean "no rate", and they are not several
 * ways of saying the same thing - each one names a different thing that is
 * missing and a different person who can supply it. One of them is not even a
 * single thing: `subdivision_unknown` is returned for three different
 * situations that a reader has to act on differently. They are told apart by
 * the shape of the response rather than by reading the server's English
 * `reason`, because matching on prose breaks the first time somebody rewords

 * The end of the switch below, and the reason it is a switch.
 *
 * `TaxResolutionStatus` in `api.ts` calls itself a closed union and says a
 * status added on the server should be a compile error here. Nothing made
 * that true: the classifier was an if-chain ending in a catch-all, so a new
 * status compiled silently and fell through to the conflict state. The
 * promise was written one level across from anything that enforces it, which
 * is worse than no promise, because it stops the next person checking.
 *
 * Typing the parameter `never` is the enforcement. Every status the switch
 * handles is narrowed away before this call, so a status added to the union
 * and to nothing else leaves a real type here and the call fails to compile,
 * naming the status it could not narrow.
 *
 * At runtime it degrades instead of throwing. Reaching here means a client
 * older than the server it is talking to, and the safe reading of a status we
 * cannot name is the one this file already applies to everything it cannot
 * turn into a number: show no rate. A throw would take the panel down over a
 * deploy-order skew.
