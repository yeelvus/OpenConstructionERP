"""Starter labor rate template library.

Loads a small set of all-in rate build-ups so the rate library, the template
picker on the labor rates page and the labour-rate selector on the norm
expansion page are all useful out of the box. Without it a fresh install opens
the build panel on an empty picker and answers with "No labour-rate templates
yet. Create one on the Labour Rates page first.", which is a dead end on the
one screen that turns a production norm into a priced assembly.

The figures are generic starting points an estimator is expected to tune per
project, trade and region. They name no employer, no agreement and no supplier,
only the trade and the kind of charge, and each template is hand-authored in
its own currency rather than converted from one base, so the number reads the
way a rate sheet in that market is actually written.

Templates are owner-scoped, which is what makes this seeder different from the
other library seeds in the platform. A row with a NULL ``owner_id`` is readable
only by an admin (``labor_rates.router._scope_owner_id`` drops the owner filter
for the admin role, and ``_load_owned_template`` answers 404 on a NULL owner for
everybody else), so a platform-wide seed would fill the page for the one persona
least likely to build a rate and leave it empty for the estimator. The library
is therefore seeded against a real user id and the caller says which one.

Module import stays light on purpose: only :data:`DEFAULT_RATE_TEMPLATES` and
stdlib live at module top, and the ORM / session imports are deferred inside
:func:`seed_labor_rates`, so the pure default data can be imported (and
unit-tested) without a database or SQLAlchemy on the path.
