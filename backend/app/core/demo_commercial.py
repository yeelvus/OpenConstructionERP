"""One commercial story for every demo seeder that deals in money.

The reconciliation register and the earned-value baseline are shown one after
another in the same walkthrough: a viewer reads the margin on one screen and
the forecast on the next, and takes them for two views of one job. If each
seeder invents its own progress curve and its own budget, the two screens
disagree by construction, and the disagreement is worse than either screen
being empty - an empty screen says "no data", two confident and different
answers say the product cannot add up.

So the shape of the job lives here, once: how its money is spent month by
month, which packages it is made of, what each package was supposed to earn
and what it has actually cost. A seeder decides what to write; it does not
decide what the job is doing.

Nothing here reads or writes the database except :func:`bill_total`, which
totals the project's own priced bill. That total is the anchor for everything
downstream, because it is the figure the cost-model screen shows and therefore
the one a viewer will cross-check against.
