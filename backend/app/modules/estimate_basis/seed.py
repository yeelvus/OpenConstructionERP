"""Estimate-basis demo seed - a versioned basis of estimate per demo project.

Drafts the qualification document that goes out with a price: what is included,
what is excluded, and what was assumed. Nothing here is written by hand. Every
line is produced by the module's own :mod:`.derivation` engine reading the
project's real BOQ, its real allowances register and its real preliminaries, so
the trades listed as included are the trades the estimate actually prices and
the allowance lines quote the amounts the allowances screen shows.

Documents are versioned rather than overwritten, which is how the module works,
so a project carries a short history: the concept-design basis signed off
earlier in the job, the tender issue behind it, and the current draft on top.
The older ones are ``final``; the newest is a ``draft`` carrying two edits an
estimator would really make - a standard exclusion switched off because the
scope does include it, and a project-specific assumption typed in by hand. That
is what turns the screen from a generated list into a document somebody owns.

Every write goes through :class:`EstimateBasisService`, the same layer the API
uses, so a document this seeder cannot produce is a document the application
would have rejected too.

Generation dates are anchored to the run date, never hardcoded, so the history
still reads as recent a year from now.

Acts on the demo estate only, and on all of it. Every project handed in is
considered - there is no "flagship plus a few" cap, which is how a screen ends
up permanently empty on the projects that fell outside it. A project outside the
estate is declined outright rather than merely skipped as already-seeded: see
:func:`_is_demo_project`. On top of that, a project that already carries a basis
document is left untouched, so a re-run never doubles the history.
