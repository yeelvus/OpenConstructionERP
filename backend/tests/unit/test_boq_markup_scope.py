"""Unit tests for markup inheritance with per-position and per-section override.

``_calculate_markup_amounts_scoped`` is the composition layer over the bill's
markup cascade. It partitions the direct cost into buckets of leaves that see
the same set of overrides, runs the existing cascade once per bucket, and adds
each line's earnings back up. These tests pin the three things that decide
whether that is safe to ship:

* Nothing moves when nothing is scoped. Every bill in every database today has
  no scoped line, and the founder refused a rounding reconciliation precisely
  because it would reprice stored estimates. A partition that shifts a total by
  a cent would do the same thing under another name, so the unscoped path is
  asserted to be identical to the cascade it delegates to, not merely close.
* The buckets sum to the caller's own direct cost, whatever tree they walked.
* The override semantics that are easy to get subtly wrong: an exception
  changes a rate and never the compounding order, a nearer scope beats a wider
  one, and an inactive override means the company line is inherited again.

Amounts are asserted against the base each line was computed on rather than
against the grand total. A total can agree for the wrong reasons; a base
cannot.
