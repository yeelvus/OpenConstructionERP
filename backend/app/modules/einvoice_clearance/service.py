"""E-invoice clearance service - the round trip and the state behind it.

Stateless helpers over the three models. What lives here is the part that is
genuinely this module's: preparing a payload, deciding whether it may go,
handing it to an adapter, and reading the answer as the regime defines it.

Two things it deliberately does not do:

* build an EN 16931 invoice. :mod:`app.modules.einvoice` does that, in two
  syntaxes across ten profiles, and is imported as a library.
* talk to a government platform. That is an adapter, behind an interface.

The gate
========
:func:`app.modules.einvoice_clearance.validators.evaluate` runs the rules
through the validation engine, which is guarded: a broken rule degrades to "no
findings" so a validation bug cannot stop somebody recording the state of an
invoice. That guard is exactly why it is not what stops a bad submission. The
consequential paths call
:func:`app.modules.einvoice_clearance.validators.hard_blockers` instead, which
runs the same rule objects with no guard at all, so a silenced engine can never
become a way to put an incomplete document to a tax authority. Same rules, two
callers, one definition.
