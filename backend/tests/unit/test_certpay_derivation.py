"""Deriving a certified payroll week from the payroll entries.

The pivot is the part of this module with the most ways to be quietly wrong: it
groups per-worker rows, spreads them across the days of the week, splits
straight from overtime, and works out how much of the rate paid was basic wage
and how much was fringe. All of that is exercised here against a fake data
layer, so the DB is never booted, matching the payroll unit tests next door.
