# DDC-CWICR-OE: DataDrivenConstruction - OpenConstructionERP
"""Unit tests for ``scripts/check_no_proprietary_classification.py``.

The gate's own denylist is stored as hashes so that the script does not become a copy
of the material it exists to keep out of the tree. These tests inherit that property:
every red case is driven by an injected synthetic hash map, so proving that the gate
catches a proprietary title never requires writing one down here.

The green cases are the more interesting half. A denylist that fires on our own
replacement wording, or on the places that legitimately name a standard, would be
worse than no gate at all, so those are asserted against the real hash list.
