// `moduleNames.join(', ')` writes one language's separator for every reader.
// The case card assembled two localized sentences that way: the keys went out
// to forty two languages and the comma between the items inside them stayed
// Latin, so a Japanese reader got "Projects, BOQ, 4D Schedule" where the
// enumeration mark is U+3001 and an Arabic reader got a Latin comma where the
// Arabic one is.
//
// It was invisible to the gate that exists for exactly this question.
// `numbersAreWrittenInTheAppLanguage` scans for `new Intl.ListFormat()` built
// without a locale, so it can only see a call that was made. Code that never
// calls Intl at all leaves nothing for it to match: a gate written around the
// SHAPE OF A CALL is blind to the path that avoided the call.
//
// This file pins the fix, and one thing about the fix that is easy to get
// wrong in the obvious direction - which is why it is a test and not a
// comment. `Intl.ListFormat` offers a `type: 'unit'`, and for a list of module
// names that name reads like the right pick. It is not: in CLDR that type
// describes a list of MEASUREMENTS, "3 ft 7 in", so Chinese joins it with
// nothing whatsoever. Reaching for it would turn a wrong separator into no
// separator, which is a worse bug wearing the fix's clothes.
//
// Following the house rule from `formatCompactCurrency.test.ts`: the exact
// glyphs and spacing belong to the engine's CLDR data and move between ICU
// versions, so what is asserted here is the property that was broken, not the
// string that happens to come back today.

// Imported here rather than awaited inside the last case, and the placement is
// the point. Reaching `@/app/i18n` pulls the module registry and the English
// bundle through the transform, which measured about nine seconds on this
// machine against a fifteen second per-test budget. Inside the case that cost
// counted against the case: it passed with a couple of seconds to spare on an
// idle machine and blew through the budget whenever the machine was busy,
// failing as a timeout that reads like a broken assertion and sends the next
// reader looking for a defect in the formatter. At module scope the same work
// is collection cost, which no per-test timeout bounds, and the case is left
// measuring what it is about.
