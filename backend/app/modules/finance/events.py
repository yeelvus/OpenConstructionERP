"""Finance event subscribers - turn procurement mutation events into
ProjectBudget.committed / actual updates.

Until v2.9.17 ``procurement.po.issued`` and ``procurement.gr.confirmed``
were published into a void: nothing in finance listened, so
``ProjectBudget.committed`` and ``ProjectBudget.actual`` stayed at 0
even when POs totalled millions.  The EVM dashboard's BAC and CPI were
silently divorced from real procurement activity.

The handlers in this module subscribe to those events and adjust the
project's budget rows accordingly:

* ``procurement.po.approved`` → committed += po.amount_total (TOP-30 #10:
  budget is committed when a PO is approved, the moment the spend is
  authorised, since a PO must be approved before it can be issued)
* ``procurement.po.cancelled`` / ``procurement.po.reverted`` →
  committed -= the amount this PO had added (Max-Audit #10: the
  commitment ledger must be reversible so a cancelled or reverted PO
  does not leave a phantom commitment on the budget)
* ``procurement.gr.confirmed`` → committed -= gr.amount, actual += gr.amount

The commitment a PO contributes is idempotent and reversible: each
approved PO stamps a per-PO marker (``committed_from_po:<po_id>``) in the
absorbing ``ProjectBudget.metadata_`` recording the amount it added to
``committed``. A replayed/re-fired ``po.approved`` for the same PO is a
no-op (the marker already exists), and a cancel/revert decrements exactly
the marked amount (and only if it was actually added). This keeps
``committed`` honest under the PO FSM's ``approved -> draft`` /
``approved -> cancelled`` transitions.

Each handler opens its own short-lived session via
:data:`async_session_factory` (mirrors the pattern in
``notifications/events.py``) so a write failure inside the subscriber
never rolls back the upstream procurement transaction.

Budget-row selection strategy when a project has multiple budgets:
the handler picks the budget whose ``wbs_id`` matches the PO's first
line item ``wbs_id``; if there's no match (or the PO has no line
items / no wbs_id), it falls back to the oldest budget for the
project (``ORDER BY created_at LIMIT 1``).  That keeps single-budget
projects working unchanged and gives multi-budget projects a stable
WBS-driven mapping without forcing every PO line to declare a budget
explicitly.
