"""Factur-X / ZUGFeRD hybrid PDF builder.

A hybrid e-invoice is a human-readable PDF that carries the machine-readable
EN 16931 CII XML embedded inside it as an associated file, with the Factur-X
XMP metadata that lets a receiver find and trust the XML. ZUGFeRD 2.1 (Germany)
and Factur-X 1.0 (France) are the same thing under two names, and the hybrid
concept is used internationally.

This module renders the readable page with reportlab (already a dependency)
and embeds the CII with pypdf (already a dependency), setting the associated
-file relationship (/AF + /AFRelationship) and the Factur-X XMP that a hybrid
invoice needs. The embedded CII is the legally operative content and is fully
EN 16931 valid (see ``cii.py``).

Note on strict PDF/A-3b: full PDF/A-3b conformance (OutputIntent + ICC colour
profile) is not asserted here. The file is a correct Factur-X hybrid carrying
the XML with the right relationship and metadata; if a receiver demands strict
PDF/A-3b, run the output through a PDF/A post-processor. The XML path (used by
every automated receiver) is unaffected.

    The page carried the post code and the city and nothing else, so BT-35 and

    reached the person reading the page. A hybrid invoice is one document in two
    representations, and the two stated different addresses for the same party
    on every invoice this product has issued, in every country.

    A field the party does not answer produces no line, which is what keeps the
    invoices that carry no street byte-identical to the pages they were before.

    The order is the country's own. The page used to write the post code before
    the city for everyone, which is right for the DACH countries and the rest of
    continental Europe and wrong for every party the ``peppol_aunz`` and
    ``peppol_sg`` profiles exist to serve. BT-40 / BT-55 already names the
    country on both parties, so the page had the answer and was not asking.

    ``state`` is not passed because :class:`Party` has no field to carry it:
    BT-39 / BT-54 CountrySubentity is absent from the model, so a US or
    Australian party prints "Boston 02108" where it should print
    "Boston, MA 02108". The shape is right and one part is missing, which is a
    question about the party model rather than about this renderer.
