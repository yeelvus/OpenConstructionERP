"""A progress period is a point in time, so two of them cannot be the same one.

The S-curve on a demo project fell 36.7 points in one month and ended the
year below its own July. Nothing was wrong with the readings: the seeder
writes one cumulative percentage per month and they climb. What was wrong was
the label. It kept the project's start year and wrapped the month with
``% 12``, so a programme starting in April 2026 labelled its 13th month
``2026-04`` again, exactly like its 1st.

Everything downstream is keyed by that label. The cumulative endpoint reads
the latest entry per period, sorts the periods as strings and subtracts
neighbours, so a month that owned three readings kept whichever one the
dedupe picked and the ladder came back out of order. The arithmetic was never
asked to produce a monotone series, it was handed a shuffled one.

What is pinned here is the property, not the fix: over the seeded set of a
project, one label means one month, and reading the percentages in label
order climbs. Both halves matter - unique labels with a scrambled ordering
would still draw a falling S-curve.

Pure generation, so no database.
