"""The work-package label recases keys and leaves written text alone.

The interface register printed "Lv 01" where the work package is "LV 01 -
Baustelleneinrichtung und Gemeinkosten". The label is built at seed time from a
subcontractor's first trade category, and that column holds two very different
kinds of string: the lowercase snake_case keys this module's own pool uses, and
whatever text a real register was set up with. ``str.title()`` is right for the
first and destroys the second, because it lowercases the tail of every word,
and an initialism does not survive that.

These cases are the two kinds side by side. The keys are asserted as well as the
free text, because a guard that only stopped the folding would also have stopped
"fire_protection" from ever becoming readable, and the register would have gone
from one wrong label to twenty.
