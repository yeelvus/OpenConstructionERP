"""Upload endpoints must advertise exactly the formats and limits they enforce.

The BIM Hub CAD upload published ``CAD file (RVT, IFC, DWG, DGN, FBX, OBJ,
3DS)`` in its OpenAPI metadata long after the handler had stopped accepting the
last three. An API consumer reading the Swagger UI uploaded an FBX and got a
400 every time. The constant and the refusal message had been corrected in an
earlier pass; the two *published* surfaces, the ``File(...)`` description and
the docstring, were left behind, because nothing compared them to anything.

That is the class this module gates. For every upload endpoint listed in
``CONTRACTS`` it derives both sides from code and asserts they are equal:

* the **advertised** set is parsed out of the endpoint's own published
  metadata, the route description (its docstring) and every parameter
  description, wherever the ``Accepted extensions:`` marker introduces a
  dotted list;
* the **enforced** set is read from the constant the handler actually tests
  the uploaded extension against.

Neither side restates the other, so the assertion is not equal by
construction: adding an extension to the constant without touching the prose
fails, and naming one in the prose that the handler will refuse fails too.
``tests/unit/test_upload_contract_gate_red_control.py`` is the paired control
that perturbs each surface on its own and proves this test goes red.

The same table carries the documented size cap. A description may stay silent
about a limit, but if it names one in megabytes that number has to be the one
the handler enforces - the AI photo endpoint documented a 10 MB maximum next
to a comment reading "No upload size cap - per product policy".
