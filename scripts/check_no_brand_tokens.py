"""Fail the build if a competitor brand leaks in, or a named CAD tool loses its mark.

Two rules live here and they are not the same rule.

Competitor products must never appear in any commit, code, UI string, changelog
or build artifact. Internal research stays internal; everything shippable uses
neutral generic names. The hashed denylist below enforces that one.

CAD authoring tools we convert FROM are the documented exception. Naming them is
the only way to tell a user which files the pipeline actually reads, so they are
allowed in UI strings, and the founder ruling of 2026-08-14 settles the form:
the first mention in each string carries the registered sign, which is the same
treatment the marketing site has used since 2026-07. The trademark form check
enforces that one. It is deliberately hash-free, because here the word is
permitted and only its form is in question, so the report can name it outright
instead of masking it.

English reaches a user through three surfaces, and a check that guards one of
them reports green over the other two. A locale value is the surface everyone
thinks of; an i18n default inside a component is the fallback when a key is
missing, and `guide.eac.selectors.body` has no entry in any of the forty
locales, so its default is the only English that will ever render; a bare
quoted literal in a component never went through i18n at all. All three are
scanned. What is deliberately NOT marked is data: a file-format token
(RVT/DWG/IFC/DGN), a code identifier, the converter's repository slug, a
shipped release note, and a rule pack's `name`, which another file matches
against byte-for-byte.

This gate enforces both automatically so neither relies on a reviewer
remembering. It is wired into both the local pre-commit hook and CI, exactly
like ``check_version_sync.py``.

Brand-safe by design: this file stores only SHA-256 hashes of the lowercased
brand tokens, never the literal brand strings, so the denylist itself does not
put a brand name in the repo. Because SHA-256 collisions are infeasible, the gate
matches ONLY the exact brand tokens, which means it cannot raise a false positive
on an unrelated word. Generic dictionary words that happen to also be product
names are intentionally left out of the automated list (they would match the
ordinary English word) and are covered by human review instead.

When a match is found the report prints the file, line, and a MASKED form of the
token (first and last character plus length) so a developer can locate and remove
it without the log reproducing the full brand string.

Exit codes:
    0  no brand token found, and every named CAD tool carries its mark
    1  a brand token leaked, or a UI string dropped the mark (file:line listed)

Usage::

    python scripts/check_no_brand_tokens.py                # scan all tracked text files (full audit)
    python scripts/check_no_brand_tokens.py path/a path/b  # scan given files (pre-commit)
    python scripts/check_no_brand_tokens.py --since origin/main   # scan only files changed vs a ref (CI guard)

The ``--since`` mode guards against NEW leaks without failing on pre-existing
debt, which is the right way to turn the gate on while a one-time legacy cleanup
proceeds separately. Run with no args for the full audit that drives that cleanup.

# Founder ruling (2026-07): third-party product names are purged from every
# shippable surface and referred to only by open format (DWG/RVT/IFC/DGN) or a
# neutral category. CAD/BIM coordination product names are therefore denylisted
# below as well. The few genuinely load-bearing uses (our own DDC converter
# repository URL, a file-format detection value the parser compares against) are
# kept precise via the allowlist plus human review, so enforcement never breaks
# our own integration code.
#
# Amended 2026-08-14: the authoring tool the converter reads from is named in UI
# strings rather than purged, so it is deliberately absent from this list. It is
# not an oversight and must not be hashed in: the trademark form check below is
# what governs it, and hashing it would forbid the very strings that ruling
# permits.

        # is ordinary unaccented Portuguese and appears throughout pt and pt-BR.
        # A fourth is a three-letter acronym that is already a legitimate
        # commissioning term here and is below _MIN_LEN in any case. Their
        # products are still covered where the product name itself is coined;

# Brand tokens are coined names 4 to 14 characters long. Only hash candidate
# runs in that range so the scan stays fast on large files.
#
# The lower bound was 5 until 2026-08-23, which put four-letter manufacturer
# names out of reach entirely. It moved down after the candidates were counted
# across every tracked text file: the two four-letter names added above match
# nothing outside the files that rename them, and the two that matched ordinary
# words were left out rather than the bound left alone. Lowering the bound
# cannot by itself convict anything, since a run is only ever compared against
# the list; only a careless entry can, which is why the entries were measured.
_MIN_LEN = 4
_MAX_LEN = 14
# Two patterns and a fold between them, because the single ASCII pattern this
# check used until 2026-08-24 was wrong in both directions at once. It ended a
# run at every character outside [a-z0-9], so any separator walked a denied
# name straight through, and every non-ASCII letter ended a run too.
#
# That second half was the expensive one, and it had already cost us three
# different ways. It cut accented words into fragments, which is how ordinary
# Croatian and Spanish prose came to collide with four-letter product names,
# and why two names in this field could not be listed at all. It made a name
# written with its own umlaut unreachable, so one entry below had been recorded
# as the fragment left over after the mark was dropped, and another was
# recorded whole and could therefore never match anything. And it reduced every
# non-Latin script to nothing at all, so a line of Han characters produced no
# run to compare and the check returned clean because it could not read the
# line, which is the one result a check must never give.
#
# So a run is now any sequence of letters or digits in any script, with the
# underscore excluded so that a snake_case identifier still separates into its
# parts, and each run is folded to its base letters before it is compared.
# Marks are stripped before the run is cut as well as after, because text that
# arrives decomposed carries them as separate characters that would otherwise
# end the run exactly as before, and some tracked files are stored that way.
# Compatibility forms fold too, which closes the trick of writing a name in
# full-width Latin.
#
# Text that is pure ASCII cannot carry a diacritic or a non-Latin letter, so it
# takes the original path unchanged, and because the unit here is a line rather
# than a file, nearly every line in the tree still takes it. Both versions were
# run alternately in one process over the whole tree to keep the file cache out
# of it: the full pass CI runs came out at 114s against 123s for the version
# this replaces. The extra work on the lines that do carry an accent is more
# than paid for by matching runs directly rather than through match objects.

# Taking a name out of the product requires writing it down somewhere. The code
# that renames the catalogue rows still carrying it needs the exact old strings
# as search keys, the frozen revision that renames the same rows holds them for
# the same reason, and the test that proves the rename happened has to seed them
# to have anything to rename. Those files are about the names. An ordinary file
# that mentions one is using it. A gate that only asks whether the name is
# present cannot tell those apart and convicts all of them.
#
# The obvious answer is a list of paths that are allowed to carry it, and that
# answer is how a gate dies: the list grows by one every time somebody is
# blocked, nobody re-reads the entries, and eventually it is the list that
# decides what ships rather than the rule. So the distinction here is drawn on a
# property of the file's own content instead.
#
# A file that renames something must say what it renames it to. A file that
# merely mentions the thing has no reason to. So a denied token is passed over
# only in a file that also contains the plain descriptor that that particular
# token is renamed to. It is per pairing, not per file: in the same file, a
# denied token whose replacement is absent is still reported on its own line.
# Nothing has to be maintained, nothing can be added by asking, and a file that
# stops doing the rename stops being excused the moment it does.
#
# Both sides are hashes, so this file still contains no brand literal and no
# catalogue string. Keys are the token hashes in _DENY_HASHES; values are the
# word count of the replacement phrase and the hash of that phrase, reduced the
# way _normalised_words reduces a file. The word count is stored because a hash
# cannot be searched for - the file's own text has to be cut into phrases of the
# right length and hashed to be compared.
