"""The match tuning data has to be found from an installed layout, not just a checkout.

``data/match`` holds four files that tune matching, and all four are optional:
every reader falls back to hardcoded constants when they are absent. That
makes the failure this file guards completely silent. Three readers resolved
the directory by counting parent directories, which reaches the repo root from
a source checkout and the virtualenv's ``Lib`` after a ``pip install``, so no
packaged install ever loaded the tuning, nothing raised, and the only trace
was a debug line nobody had switched on.

The reason it survived long enough to be fixed three times in this codebase is
written into how these tests are built. In a source checkout the old
arithmetic and the new resolver return the same directory, so any test run
from the repo passes either way and proves nothing about the case that was
broken. Only :func:`app.core.match_service.data_paths.match_data_dir_for`
takes the layout as an argument, and only the tests that build a synthetic
install below can fail for the original defect. The checkout test is here as
an instrument guard, and it says so.

The other half is packaging. Fixing the resolver without shipping the bytes
leaves a pip install with a correct pointer at an absent directory, so
``test_the_wheel_destination_is_a_layout_the_resolver_can_read`` ties the
force-include destination in backend/pyproject.toml to the layout the resolver
accepts. The wheel and the frozen bundle are compared against each other
separately, in test_desktop_spec_ships_wheel_data.py.
