"""A cost-file import that dies half-way must leave nothing behind, and say so.

The endpoint stages its rows through ``bulk_import``, which adds and flushes but
never commits; the request-scoped session commits once when the endpoint returns
and rolls back when it raises. So the rows were already all-or-nothing. What was
missing was any way for the caller to know which of the two had happened: a
failure after several slices had flushed surfaced as an opaque 500 with no
statement about the rows, and the response of a run that finished said nothing
about durability either, so "did any of it land?" could only be answered by
going and looking.

Two things were genuinely wrong rather than merely unstated.

``create_catalog`` commits, and it commits on the SAME session the import then
writes through - both service dependencies resolve one ``SessionDep`` per
request. A catalog created inline for an upload therefore outlived the rollback
that discarded its rows, and because the name-availability gate refuses a
duplicate name with a 409, the obvious next move - upload the same file again -
was refused. An import that promises all-or-nothing has to take that catalog
with it, and only that one: a catalog the caller addressed by ``catalog_id``
existed before the upload and is not the import's to delete.

The failure path is what these tests are for. A suite that only covers the
successful import says nothing at all about durability, because on the happy
path atomic and resumable are indistinguishable.

No database is involved: the service is replaced by a recorder that fails on a
chosen hand-over, and the session by one that counts its rollbacks.
