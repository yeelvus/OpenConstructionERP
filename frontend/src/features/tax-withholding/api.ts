/**
 * API helpers for the Tax Withholding module.
 *
 * Backed by /api/v1/tax-withholding/ — see
 * backend/app/modules/tax_withholding/router.py
 *
 * Money and percentages arrive as plain-decimal **strings**, not numbers. The
 * backend serialises them that way on purpose: a deduction reported one cent
 * light is a return that does not reconcile with the tax authority, and that
 * is not a rounding this product is entitled to make. They stay strings here
 * too, and are parsed only where one is compared.
 *
 * Only the read side plus the preview is wired. Recording and editing
 * deductions and reverse-charge determinations are deliberately absent rather
 * than half-built — see the note at the top of TaxWithholdingPanel.tsx.
