// routeIcons.ts says in its own header that it MIRRORS the nav definitions and
// that the two must be kept in sync by hand. That sentence has been there since
// the map was written and nothing has ever checked it, so this does.
//
// The claim under test is narrow on purpose: for every screen the menu offers,
// asking the route-icon map about that exact path returns the same glyph the
// menu row draws. Where the map has no entry for a path it answers with the
// parent module's icon, which is the behaviour detail routes rely on, so a
// disagreement here is a real one rather than a gap.

// A menu row and the screen behind it live in different files, and one of them

// places: the static <Route> list in App.tsx, and the manifests under
// src/modules, which ModuleRoutes mounts only for modules that are enabled.
// The sidebar, meanwhile, hides a row only when the row names a module. So a
// row whose screen is module-owned and that names no module survives its own
// route being unmounted, and the click lands on the catch-all Not Found.
//
// Both sources have to be read together. Checking the menu against App.tsx
// alone reports four working screens as dead, which is how the gap below was
// first mis-diagnosed. App.tsx is read as text rather than imported: importing
