"""Hold the timeline allowlist against the events ``app/`` actually publishes.

This is the check whose absence *was* the bug. The module shipped with sixteen
prefixes, nine of which matched no event in the codebase at all
(``changeorder.`` where the publisher says ``changeorders.``, ``schedule.``
where it says ``schedule_advanced.``, plus ``rfi.``, ``transmittal.``,
``submittal.``, ``delay.``, ``handover.``, ``clash.`` and ``budget.``), and it
captured 13 of 225 published event names. Fifteen unit tests covered that
mapping and all of them passed, because they only ever asked the mapping about
names the mapping itself had invented. Nothing compared the allowlist to
reality, so the allowlist could say anything.

Three directions are gated here, and all three are needed:

1. every prefix matches at least one published name - catches the typo;
2. every exact entry is published verbatim - catches the same typo in the
   other list, and entries that a publisher has since renamed;
3. everything either list captures is *routable* - catches an event that would
   be recorded and then be permanently unreachable.

Direction 3 is the one it is tempting to skip, because the allowlist was
generated under that rule in the first place. A generator that ran once is not
a gate: nothing stops the next entry being added by hand.

Scope of the measurement
------------------------
Event names are read statically with :mod:`ast`, so this sees only publishes
whose name is a string literal. At the time of writing ``app/`` also has 72
publish sites whose name is computed at runtime; those are invisible here and
are not part of any count this file makes. A "captures N of M" figure quoted
from this test is therefore about literal publishes only.

One blind spot is left on purpose, and it is large enough to name. Most modules
publish through their own ``_safe_publish`` wrapper - 326 call sites against
the 11 that call ``publish_after_commit`` directly - and this scan does not
follow them. Measured 2026-09-22: counting them too takes the scan from 227
literal names to 435 and the captured set from 91 to 126, and it lands 16 more
captured names that carry no ``project_id`` in a literal payload at the call
site, which would turn :func:`test_every_captured_event_is_routable` red. Some
of those 16 build their payload in a variable, where this scan cannot see the
keys at all, so a red there would be a mix of real gaps and scan blindness that
has to be read one by one rather than closed in a batch. Widening the scan is
worth doing; doing it means triaging those 16 in the same change, not now.
