"""Country regime registry - what each country does to an invoice.

Three acts, and they are architecturally different acts, not three flavours of
one act:

Every country named as an example below carries its ISO code in parentheses,
and a test parses those codes: each must be a ``COUNTRY_REGIMES`` entry whose
deciding act is the class it illustrates. Name a country here that the
registry does not hold, or under a class its row does not declare, and the
suite says so.

``clearance``
    Pre-issuance. The tax authority validates the document and returns an
    identifier, and the invoice is not legally valid without it. Mexico (MX)
    returns a UUID for a CFDI, Brazil (BR) a chave de acesso for an NF-e,
    Italy (IT) a protocol number from SdI, Poland (PL) a KSeF number, Romania
    (RO) an upload index, Saudi Arabia (SA) a cryptographic stamp, India (IN)
    an IRN. The document cannot be handed to the buyer until the authority has
    answered.

``reporting``
    Post-issuance. The invoice is valid the moment it is issued and is reported
    to the authority afterwards, inside a deadline. Spain (ES, SII and
    Verifactu) and Hungary (HU, RTIR) work this way.

``network``
    No authority at all. The document is routed to the buyer over an agreed
    network - Peppol BIS Billing 3.0, XRechnung into the German (DE) public
    sector, Peppol BIS into the Belgian (BE) and Irish (IE) supply chains.
    There is nothing to clear, so what this module records for these countries
    is routing state.

Countries that do more than one of them
=======================================
A country can do two of these acts at once, and calling such a country by one
of the three names alone states something false about it. France (FR) routes
the document to the buyer over a network of accredited platforms and
separately reports transaction and payment data to the DGFiP, and it is the
registry's one hybrid entry today. Other countries pair acts the same way -
Saudi Arabia (SA) reports its simplified invoices after issue where standard
ones are cleared - but a row is classed by what it declares, and the SA row
models the standard-invoice clearance path alone, as its notes say. Closing
that gap is a second act in ``additional_regimes`` on the row, not a sentence
here; this paragraph names every row the registry classes hybrid.

``regime`` therefore keeps naming the act that decides what a successful answer
means, and ``additional_regimes`` names the other acts the same country also
requires. ``regime_class`` reads ``hybrid`` for any entry that names more than
one, so a country that does two things is not filed under a name that describes
one of them. It is deliberately a derived value and not a fourth entry in
``REGIMES``: the terminal state of a submission is decided by the act it was a
submission under, and "hybrid" would leave that undecidable.

When the obligation starts, and who it starts for
=================================================
A regime is not in force everywhere the day it is legislated. The obligation to
receive and the obligation to issue commonly start years apart, and a mandate
usually arrives in waves keyed to taxpayer size or turnover rather than all at
once. ``commencement`` carries those waves as :class:`CommencementPhase` rows,
one per obligation and wave, and ``scope`` says in words who the regime covers
today. Without them the registry can say what a country does but not whether it
does it to this taxpayer yet, which is the question an operator actually asks.

Every phase names its source and the date that source was read, and the fields
are required rather than optional, because a commencement date without a
citation is indistinguishable from a remembered one and ages silently.
``legal_status`` separates a date that is in force from one that is enacted but
future and from one that is only announced; collapsing those three would let the
product answer "yes, from January" about a wave that has not been legislated.

Why the distinction is in the data and not in the code
======================================================
A single "submit and wait" code path would have to guess what a successful
answer means. Under clearance a success carries an identifier that has to be
printed on the invoice; under reporting a success is an acknowledgement that
changes nothing on the document; under network exchange a success is a delivery
receipt. Those are three different terminal states, so the regime decides the
terminal state rather than the adapter guessing it.

``en16931_profile`` is the one place this module touches document generation.
Where it is set, the country's format is one the platform already builds - the
EN 16931 engine in :mod:`app.modules.einvoice`, which ships CII and UBL and ten
profiles. Where it is empty the national format is outside that engine (CFDI,
NF-e, FatturaPA, KSeF FA(2), ZATCA, the Indian IRP schema, SII, RTIR), and the
caller supplies the payload. Nothing here reimplements a byte of EN 16931.

Country names, platform names and national field names are data.
