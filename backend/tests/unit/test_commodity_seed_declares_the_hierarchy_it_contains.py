"""The commodity-code seed must describe a hierarchy it actually contains.

``app/modules/supplier_catalogs/data/unspsc_construction.csv`` ships inside the
wheel and is loaded verbatim by ``SupplierCatalogsService.seed_commodity_codes``:
every column becomes a column of ``oe_supplier_catalogs_commodity_code``, and
``level`` and ``parent_code`` become the tree an integration walks. Nothing
between the CSV and the database recomputes either of them, so a wrong number in
the file is a wrong number in every customer's lookup table.

Until this test the module had nothing asserting the seed was well formed. The
census that prompted it found 27 of 48 UNSPSC rows declaring a ``level`` their
own code contradicts, rows declaring a ``parent_code`` that is not their
structural parent, and rows whose structural parent is absent from the file
altogether.

What is asserted, and why each one is a property rather than a list of rows
known to be bad. A list goes stale the moment a row is added; these four rules
are computed from the digits, so a row added tomorrow is checked on the same
terms as a row that shipped last year.

1. ``level`` agrees with the shape of the code. Both vocabularies encode depth
   in trailing zeros, but they do not encode it the same way, and the file's
   original defect was applying UNSPSC's rule to CPV. UNSPSC is a fixed
   four-level hierarchy of digit pairs - segment ``XX000000``, family
   ``XXXX0000``, class ``XXXXXX00``, commodity ``XXXXXXXX``. CPV under
   Regulation (EC) No 2195/2002 splits at odd positions - division (2 digits),
   group (3), class (4), category (5).
2. A declared ``parent_code`` names a row that is in the file. A parent nothing
   resolves to is a broken edge in the tree the API serves.
3. A declared ``parent_code`` is the *nearest declared ancestor* of its code: a
   strict structural prefix, with no nearer ancestor that the file also
   declares. This is what catches a flattened tree - a row parked directly on
   the segment while its real class sits two lines above it.
4. ``(scheme, code)`` is unique. ``models.CommodityCode`` carries exactly this
   as a ``UniqueConstraint``, but the loader upserts row by row, so a duplicate
   in the CSV does not raise: the later line silently overwrites the earlier
   one and the row count still reports both.

What is deliberately NOT asserted, stated here so nobody later reads this as a
completeness check. This file is a curated construction subset of two very large
vocabularies, not a closed tree, and it is not the place to decide it should
become one:

* That a code exists in the published vocabulary. That needs the vocabulary, it
  is not derivable from the file, and it is the question the census answered by
  hand against the official code list.
* That the label is the official title for the code.
* That every code's family or segment is itself present as a row. Requiring
  that would mean adding rows for ancestors whose official titles nobody here
  has, and inventing titles is how the file got into this state. Rule 3 gets
  the achievable half of it: an ancestor the file *does* declare may not be
  skipped.
