"""Every force-include path the wheel needs must reach the Docker build context.

The backend wheel is built by pip inside the image, from ``./backend``, and
``[tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel.force-include]`` in backend/pyproject.toml
names paths that live outside the backend directory. hatchling resolves that
map while the wheel is being built and aborts the entire build on the first
entry it cannot find, with ``FileNotFoundError: Forced include not found``.
The Dockerfile therefore has to put every one of those paths into the image
before it installs, and there was nothing holding the two lists together.

What that cost. v16.2.0 published its PyPI package and its GitHub release and
shipped no container image at all. Two 16.2.0 commits added entries pointing
outside backend/: f5ae08469 added ``../data/match``, and 519a75ae5 added one
line per community pack. Neither reached the Dockerfile. data/ was copied, but
after the install, and packs/ was not copied at all, so the build died at
``pip install`` with ``/app/data/match`` missing. The release workflow is the
only thing that builds this image and it only triggers on tags, so the break
was invisible until the tag was already cut and PyPI had already published:
the worst ordering available, and not one anybody chose.

The shape of the defect is two lists in two files that have to agree with
nobody checking. That comes back the first time someone adds a pack, which is
a thing this project does routinely. Hence this check rather than a one-line
repair.

Direction matters, both ways
----------------------------
A map entry with no COPY is the failure above: the image does not build.

A COPY with no map entry is quieter and worse. Four packs in this repo are
deliberately held out of the community wheel, and out of these images with
it: ``aus-nzs`` (deprecated, superseded by ``aus`` and ``nzs``),
``batimatech-ca`` and ``bimhessen-de`` (partnership agreements stated in their
licence sections), and ``doker-formwork`` (its licence section is plain AGPL,
but it carries a named third party's logo, partner name and URL). A COPY that
puts one of those into the build context bakes it into that image layer
permanently, because deleting a file in a later layer does not remove it from
the layer that added it, and these images go to ghcr.io publicly. Nothing
would fail. The image would build, pass its healthcheck and ship.

Those four are not written down here. Set equality against the map already
excludes them, and backend/tests/unit/test_community_packs_ship.py already
holds the map itself against the licence signals in the tree in both
directions. A second copy of that list in this file would be a second source
of truth, and it would be the one that goes stale on the day a pack correctly
becomes a community pack.

Why the Dockerfile lists packs one line at a time
------------------------------------------------
The licensing control above is the first reason. The second is that it has to
be that way regardless: app/core/partner_pack/discovery.py locates a pack by
globbing ``*/src/openconstructionerp_*/manifest.py`` under a ``packs``
directory beside the installed ``app`` package, so the per-pack ``src`` level
has to survive into the image with its shape intact. A single COPY with many
sources flattens them all into one destination directory, which would break
that glob for the packs that are supposed to ship. Both reasons point at the
same line-per-pack layout.

``../frontend/dist`` is exempt, and it is the only exemption
-----------------------------------------------------------
It cannot be copied. .dockerignore excludes ``frontend/dist`` and ``**/dist``,
so it is never present in the build context to copy from. It is satisfied
instead by the placeholder backend/hatch_build.py writes before hatchling
resolves the map, plus the ``mkdir`` in the unified stage, and the bytes that
actually get served are copied out of the frontend-build stage. The exemption
is a named constant rather than a silent filter so that adding a second one is
a visible act.

On the matching, which is the part that is easy to get wrong
-----------------------------------------------------------
The COPY directives are parsed, not searched for as substrings. A check that
grepped the Dockerfile for a pack name would be satisfied by this file's own
prose, or by a comment mentioning a pack, and would then be measuring the
comments rather than the build. Only the ``backend-base`` stage is read,
because that is the shared base both installs derive from; ``COPY --from=``
lines are skipped, since they copy between stages rather than from the
context; and ``backend/`` itself is excluded as the stage's own base copy,
which is what makes the map's backend-relative entries resolve.

Run ``--selftest`` to see it fail in both directions. That works on temporary
copies of the two real files and never writes to either.
