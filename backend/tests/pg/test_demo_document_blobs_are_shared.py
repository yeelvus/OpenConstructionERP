"""Demo document bytes are stored once per install and outlive a sibling deletion.

Every demo project is handed the same native CAD sources, and the seeder used to
write them into a folder per project. One eighteen megabyte coordinated model was
therefore on disk once per project, and a seeded install spent most of its size
repeating a handful of files. The bytes now go to a content-addressed store that
the whole install shares, which is what makes the properties below matter rather
than being pedantry about a seeder.

Sharing one file between rows turns an ordinary deletion into a way to lose
somebody else's document. ``DocumentService.delete_document`` unlinked the blob
whenever it removed a row, so deleting one project's copy of the shared model
would have taken the file away from every other project, leaving rows that look
healthy in every listing and answer 404 on download. That guard is asserted here,
against rows in a database, rather than beside the seeder: a unit test over the
helper would keep passing the day ``delete_document`` stopped calling it.

The idempotency half is the other reason this file exists. A seeder that is safe
to run twice has to be safe when the first run died halfway, so a row whose file
has gone is repaired instead of skipped, and a blob already in place is not
rewritten. Both directions are checked, because a seeder that rewrote every blob
on every run would pass a test that only counted files.
