"""Content-Disposition headers that survive non-ASCII document names.

Export endpoints used to build the header from
``name.encode("ascii", errors="replace")``, which turns every character outside
ASCII into a question mark. A Leistungsverzeichnis called "Bürogebäude Frankfurt
Europaviertel" was offered to the browser as ``B?rogeb?ude Frankfurt
Europaviertel.X84``, and because ``?`` is not a legal filename character on
Windows the browser then saved it as ``B_rogeb_ude...``. Every German, French,
Spanish, Turkish and Chinese name came out damaged.

RFC 6266 solved this: send the ASCII form under ``filename`` for very old
clients, and the real UTF-8 name under ``filename*`` using the RFC 5987
encoding. Every browser in use prefers ``filename*`` when both are present.
