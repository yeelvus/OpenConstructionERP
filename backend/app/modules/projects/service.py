    project-scoped sweep cannot reach them. But ``install_demo_project``
    also seeds one Equipment unit and one Subcontractor *per demo project*

    survive as orphans and the next re-seed PK/key-collides on them.

    the bulk fleet / vendor / catalogue registries seeded once at boot

             generated ``project_code``, ``name = f"{source.name} (Copy)"``
             and ``owner_id`` from the caller. Every other column is
             copied verbatim - including JSON fields (``validation_rule_sets``,
             ``custom_fields``, ``address``, ``fx_rates``, ``custom_units``,
             ``metadata_``).
          3. Re-key each child collection onto the new project id with
             fresh UUIDs. For ``ProjectWBS`` we do this in two passes so the
             hierarchical ``parent_id`` links inside the tree are preserved
             through the new id mapping. Ordinals (``sort_order``), levels
             and dates are kept verbatim.
          4. Copy ``MatchProjectSettings`` (one-to-one with the project) so
             the cloned project keeps catalogue binding, classifier choice,
             auto-link thresholds, source toggles, etc.

        The whole operation runs in the request's session - the request
        dependency (``get_session``) commits on success and rolls back on
        any raise, so a child insert failure cleanly aborts the parent
        insert too. Returns the new ``Project`` ORM row (caller wraps it
        in ``ProjectResponse``).

    Selection rule (language-aware, since 2.9.34):

    1. **Prefer a vectorised catalogue whose language matches the project's
       region**, even if a different-language catalogue has more rows.
       Without this, a US project with the Russian CWICR catalogue loaded

       any catalogue with the same language wins ahead of any other.

    2. **Fall back to the dominant vectorised catalogue** (most rows, any
       language) when no language match is available. Better cross-language
       BGE-M3 recall than no catalogue at all.

    Returns the bound catalogue id (e.g. ``"USA_NEWYORK"``), or ``None``
    when no catalogue qualifies (fresh install, vectoriser not run yet).
    Idempotent: callers can invoke this on every session create; if the
