    This is asserted structurally, on the compiled statement, and that is a

    Python-side default, so a burst of bridge writes lands several rows on one
    timestamp; ordering by it alone leaves tied rows in whatever order the plan
    happens to emit, and ``OFFSET``/``LIMIT`` over a non-total order may drop
    some rows and repeat others between pages.

    The behaviour cannot be provoked on demand: with a few tied rows PostgreSQL
    sorts deterministically, and this suite was checked with the tiebreaker
    removed - every behavioural paging assertion still passed. A test that only
    fails when the planner changes its mind is a flaky test that proves nothing
    on the runs where it passes, so the guarantee is gated where it is actually
    decided.
