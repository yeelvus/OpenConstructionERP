"""The diary seeder must skip the projects a person wrote, not the ones it wrote.

The demo installer lays down a handful of empty diary headers of its own
before the module seeder runs. The guard used to ask "does this project hold
a diary", which those headers answered for every project on the estate, so
the ninety-day register with entries, weather, photos and signatures was
written, tested and never once inserted. Nobody noticed because the screen
was not empty: it showed the installer's headers.

The distinction being gated is therefore between three kinds of row that all
look alike from a count: the installer's placeholder, this seeder's own work,
and a diary a user typed. Only the last may stop a project, and only the
first may be removed.

Against a real PostgreSQL schema because (project_id, diary_date) is unique,
and the reason the placeholders have to go rather than be written around is
that the ninety-day window lands on top of them.
