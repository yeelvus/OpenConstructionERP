"""A purchase-order line's link to the cost spine, written and read back.

The committed-against-budget report has been complete and dead since it was
written: ``CostSpineRepository.po_committed_by_cost_line`` filters
``cost_line_id IS NOT NULL`` and nothing ever set that column, so every project
reported zero committed. A test that only asserted the happy path would have
passed against that writer, because a writer that does nothing still leaves a
column null and a report empty.

So the negative cases are first-class here. Each one reads the committed
aggregate itself rather than only inspecting the column, because a column
assertion cannot tell a link that is absent from a link the report declines to
follow.
