"""Combined tax rates: does the shipped data say how two rates add up?

These tests read ``seed_data/tax_configurations.json`` directly rather than a
database, because the seed file is what a new installation gets and it is the
thing that has to be right. They exist to stop one specific bug.

Canada levies a federal rate and, in most provinces, a provincial one, and the
two combine in two opposite ways. A harmonised rate REPLACES the federal rate,
so Ontario is 13 % and not 5 + 13. A separate provincial rate STACKS on it, so
British Columbia is 5 + 7. Before the ``combination`` column, nothing in a row
said which, and the obvious implementation - federal plus my province - gives
the right answer in British Columbia and an 18 % invoice in Ontario. A bug that
is correct in the province you happened to test in is a bug that ships.

The rule that decides replace-versus-stack is therefore read out of the data,
never written here. The resolver branches on ``combination`` and on nothing
else; it does not know that HST is harmonised, and if every row were mislabelled
it would happily return the wrong numbers. That is deliberate: these tests are a
check on the data, so the data has to be able to fail them.
``test_marking_ontario_as_stacking_breaks_the_published_figure`` proves it can.

Two things changed with v3307, and both close what this file used to record as
weaknesses.

The province is now a column. It used to live in ``tax_code`` as a naming
convention that differed between countries and that nothing enforced, so this
file parsed it. ``_jurisdiction_from_tax_code`` still parses it, but only to
assert that the convention and the new ``subdivision_code`` agree on all eleven
rows - which makes the old weakness into a free check on the backfill.

And the arithmetic is no longer written here. It used to be a private
``_combined_rate`` in this file, which meant the figures below were checked
against a second implementation that no user ever ran. It now calls the
resolver the API serves, so this file checks the shipped *data* and
``test_tax_subdivision_resolver.py`` checks the same function against rows in a
real database. Two instruments, one subject: the data being right proves
nothing about a resolver that ignores the province, and vice versa.

# Published combined rates a quantity surveyor would recognise, by jurisdiction.

# Brunswick and Newfoundland, SOR/2016-212 for Prince Edward Island, SOR/2025-77
# for the Nova Scotia cut to 14 % on 2025-04-01); the separate provincial rates

# Alberta and the three territories appear because a jurisdiction with no
# provincial tax is the case a "federal plus provincial" implementation gets
# right by accident. They prove nothing on their own, and they are here to keep
# the federal row honest - and because "correctly 5 %" and "we do not know" have
# to be different answers, which is what the resolver's status says.
