# DDC-CWICR-OE: DataDrivenConstruction - OpenConstructionERP
"""One shift, two honest records, one entry on the budget.

A foreman punches the crew in and out on a phone; the diary publishes those
hours to the cost model when the entry is approved. Somebody in the office fills
in the desktop timesheet for the same site and the same day; that publishes too.
Both records are true. Together they used to make the project look like it had
paid twice for one shift, and no screen said which day it was.

The cost model's only guard was ``(report_id, status)``. That stops a message
being delivered twice and cannot see this at all: the diary entry and the
timesheet have different ids by construction. The claim asserted here is the
coarser one a person can actually check - project, day, worker.

These are PostgreSQL tests because the guard leans on a unique constraint to
settle the race between two sources arriving at once, and a constraint that is
never exercised against a real transaction is a comment.
