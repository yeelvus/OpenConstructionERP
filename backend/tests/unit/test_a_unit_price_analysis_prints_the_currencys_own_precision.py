"""A unit price analysis must print money at the currency's own precision.

Reported from a self-hosted install in Chile: a rate read ``82000.00 CLP``. The
peso has no minor unit, so those two decimals are not just noise, they are false
precision on a number that goes into a public tender. Three currency tables in
this repository already know CLP has no cents; this serialisation was not asking
any of them.

The same rounding lives on the assembly screens and was fixed there separately.
This pins the backend half, on the module closest to unit price work.
