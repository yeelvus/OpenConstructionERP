"""A data directory with a live postmaster must not get a second one.

Two OpenConstructionERP processes on one machine share ``~/.openestimate``, and
the desktop launcher can decide to start a backend while another one is already
running. Whether that is survivable comes down to a single property of
:mod:`app.core.embedded_pg`: a bring-up aimed at an occupied data directory
attaches to the cluster that is there and never creates, clears or launches
anything.

The property holds today, and it holds by accident of three separate guards
rather than by anything that states it:

* ``_pre_initialize_cluster`` and ``_clear_incomplete_cluster`` both return on
  ``PG_VERSION`` existing, and a live cluster always has one.
* ``_clear_stale_pidfile`` refuses to remove a pidfile naming a live process.
* ``pgserver.get_server()`` attaches to a running postmaster rather than
  starting another.

Nothing tested any of that, so nothing would notice it going. This is a
characterization test: it adds no behaviour and pins the behaviour there is, so
that swapping ``get_server()`` for a direct launch, or relaxing either
``PG_VERSION`` gate, fails here instead of on somebody's data.

Both polarities are asserted throughout. A module that refused to initialise
anything would pass every "leaves it alone" assertion and would never bring up a
cluster on a fresh machine, so each guard is also shown firing on the input it
was written for.
