# DDC-CWICR-OE: DataDrivenConstruction - OpenConstructionERP
"""Field Time demo seed - a populated timesheet register per demo project.

Books several weeks of foreman timesheets for every project that has the
ingredients a real one needs: workers from the resources module, plant with a
rental on the project, and cost codes taken from the project's own BOQ. Nothing
here is invented - a line can only name a worker, a machine and a cost code that
already exist in the seeded estate.

Every row is written through :class:`FieldTimeService`, the same layer the API
uses, so the seeded estate passes the same validation, gets the same
``FT-000001`` references, mints the same daywork sheets and publishes the same
events as a timesheet booked by hand. A row this seeder cannot submit is a row
the application would have rejected too.

The register is deliberately mixed: the newest days are still drafts, the days
behind them are submitted and waiting, everything older is approved, and one
approved sheet per project has been reversed - so the screen teaches the
workflow instead of showing one uniform status.

Dates are anchored to the run date (the most recent working days), never
hardcoded, so a demo opened a year from now still shows last month's hours.

Idempotent per project: a project that already carries a timesheet is left
untouched, so a re-run never doubles the register.
