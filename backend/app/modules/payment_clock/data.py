"""The shipped statutory payment regimes, and an idempotent seeder for them.

This is where the law is written down. Every number here is a statutory default
and every entry names the sections it came from, because the one question a
quantity surveyor will ask about a computed date is which provision produced
it. Nothing here is a house rule.

Two modelling decisions run through the whole table and are worth stating once
rather than once per regime.

**The due date and the final date for payment are different dates, and only the
UK Act genuinely splits them.** The UK Act makes a sum fall due, then gives a
further period before it must be paid, and the notice deadlines hang off both.
The security-of-payment statutes have one date: the progress payment "becomes
due and payable" a set number of days after the claim. Those regimes are
therefore written with the due date on the application date and the statutory
period as the final date for payment, which is what the statute actually
imposes - a last day to pay - and which keeps the final date after the due date
in every regime shipped.

**A null deadline means the statute is silent, which is not the same as zero.**
Malaysia leaves the payment period to the contract, and the EU Late Payment
Directive and the German regimes have no notice sequence at all. The rules skip
what the regime does not set rather than treating it as an instant deadline.

Seed data lives here and not in a migration on purpose: a migration is a
schema change that runs once per deployment, and this table is content that
will be corrected as statutes are amended.

#: A country_code declares itself here when PAYMENT_REGIMES has no row for it
#: and the reason is worth naming rather than left as a bare gap.
#:
#: Three values, not the two app.modules.property_dev.tax_engine uses for an
#: absent VAT block, and the difference is what each absence is a claim
#: about. VAT absence is a claim about a rate: a rate is a percentage
#: regardless of which country charges it, so NOT_MODELLED there is closable
#: by writing a row, with no change to the table's shape. A prompt payment
#: regime is a claim about the shape of a law. NO_STATUTE and NOT_MODELLED
#: are the same two ideas carried over, no such law, or a law we have not
#: yet reduced to a row, and both are closable the same way, by writing a
#: row once the research is done. DIFFERENT_SHAPE is not: Brazil Lei
#: 14.133/2021 art. 141 obliges the public buyer to pay invoices in the order
#: they were registered, which is an ordering rule, not a deadline measured
#: in days from an event. No amount of research turns "pay in registration
#: order" into a days-to-pay figure, because elapsed time since an event is
#: not the thing the statute regulates. That is a fact about what the law is,
#: not about how much of it we have modelled, and it is why this set carries
#: a third value the tax table does not: two of these three are gaps this
#: registry can close by adding a row, and one names a country whose statute
#: this registry row shape cannot express at all. Collapsing the three into
#: the tax engine two would erase exactly that distinction.

#: country_code to one of NO_REGIME_VALUES, for a country researched to a
#: category-assignable degree that turned up no row. Most of the world is
#: simply absent from this dict, which is not a violation: nobody has looked,
#: and the dict does not claim otherwise. A country present here has been
#: looked at and named; that is the entire difference between an entry and a

#: search is not evidence of absence, so a country here earns no value rather
#: than a guessed one, but country_coverage.py can still say "held" instead of
#: an unqualified MISSING indistinguishable from a country nobody has looked
#: at yet.
#:
#: Empty today. CN and RU were held here until the search was run against the
#: right instrument in each case - the State Council SME payment regulation
#: rather than the Civil Code contract chapter, and the public procurement law
#: rather than a construction-specific payment act, neither of which exists in
#: the shape the earlier search assumed. Both now have rows of their own. The

    # The United States regimes below are split public/private per state,
    # because that is where American prompt payment law actually divides: the
    # public duty is owed by a governmental entity under one statute and the
    # private duty is owed by an owner under another, with different periods and
    # different interest. Where a state gives its own agencies and its local
    # governments different periods, the public side is split again by payer.
    # The federal row covers work for a federal agency in every state.
    #
    # Every US row ends its statute_reference with the URL of the official text
    # the figures were read from, and the notes say when that text was read
    # through an archived capture because the live site refused the request. The
    # owner-to-contractor leg is the clock; the contractor-to-subcontractor leg
    # each statute adds is a second clock, written into the notes and not
    # computed, the same as every other regime in this table.
    #
    # The Texas and California state pack configs (``app.modules.us_tx_pack.config``
    # and ``app.modules.us_ca_pack.config``) name their four codes under
    # ``payment_clock_regimes`` and carry the same provisions as reference data;
    # the deadline arithmetic is written down here and nowhere else. The other
    # states have no state pack yet, so no config names their codes.
    #
    # All but one take the application date as the due date and the statutory
    # period as the final date for payment, the convention set out at the top of
    # this file. Where a statute gives the owner N days to approve and then M days
    # to pay, and both count the same kind of day, the final date is written as
    # N plus M and the approval window as the payment notice deadline. New York's
    # private act is the exception: its twelve business days to approve and
    # thirty calendar days to pay cannot be added into one count, so it carries
    # the approval deadline as the due date and the final date thirty days after
    # it, the way the UK Act splits the two. Four rows make an application that
    # is not answered in time deemed approved (Illinois private, Pennsylvania
    # private and both Arizona rows), and only those four carry
    # applied_sum_becomes_notified_sum.

            "to reproduce the statutory date - and note that the Russian working year is moved about by "
            "government decree each year, with weekends transferred to bridge holidays, which a fixed "
