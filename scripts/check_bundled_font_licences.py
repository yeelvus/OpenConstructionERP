"""Every font binary we ship carries its licence text into the artefact.

Fonts are the one dependency class our attribution pipeline is structurally
blind to. ``pip-licenses`` and ``license-checker`` both enumerate *installed
packages*; a font committed into our own source tree is not a package and has
no metadata to enumerate, so it can never appear in either output no matter how
long it ships. That is not a bug someone introduced, it is a blind spot by
construction, and it swallowed DejaVu, Instrument Serif and Plus Jakarta Sans
without a single check going red.

The obligations are real and they are not the same obligation:

* The Bitstream Vera Fonts License requires "The above copyright and trademark
  notices and this permission notice shall be included in all copies of one or
  more of the Font Software typefaces." It binds the *trademark* notice too,
  not only the copyright, which is why a Bitstream row cannot be reduced to a
  copyright line.
* The Arev Fonts License, which governs glyphs imported into the same DejaVu
  binaries, carries its own separately binding notice clause under a different
  rightsholder. ``LICENSE_DEJAVU`` is three statements, not one licence, and an
  inventory row reading "DejaVu, Bitstream Vera Fonts License" loses two.
* SIL OFL 1.1 clause 2 permits bundling "provided that each copy contains the
  above copyright notice and this license", and explicitly blesses shipping it
  as a stand-alone text file, which is the mechanism we use.

All three are satisfied today by a licence file travelling in the artefact
beside the fonts. This guard exists so that stays true for a font added next
year by somebody who never read any of the above.

WHAT THIS CHECKS, AND WHY IT IS NOT "a licence file sits next to the font"

That weaker check is the one this codebase keeps getting bitten by, and here it
would reintroduce the exact failure it exists to prevent. ``backend/pyproject
.toml`` carries ``exclude = ["**/_*.md", "**/_*.txt", ...]``. ``LICENSE_DEJAVU``
reaches the wheel only because it happens to have no extension. A future
licence arriving beside a new face as ``_LICENSE.txt`` would sit right next to
its font, pass a tree-presence check, and be silently dropped from the wheel.

So the assertion is about the packaged result rather than the tree: each
resolved licence path must survive the wheel's own exclude patterns, read out
of ``pyproject.toml`` at run time so this updates itself when someone edits
that list. On the frontend side the licence must live under ``public/``, which
is the directory Vite copies verbatim into ``dist``.

It also asserts every family appears in ``NOTICE``. ``NOTICE`` is hand
maintained and presents itself as a complete inventory, so nothing generated
can keep it honest; this check is what makes the one hand edit a one-time cost
rather than a recurring one.

TWO MODES, ONE INVENTORY

``--markdown`` emits the ``## Bundled assets`` section that
``.github/workflows/sbom-and-licenses.yml`` appends to THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md.
The gate and the generator therefore build their inventory with the same code
and cannot disagree about what we ship. A separate generator that walked the
tree its own way would be a second source of truth, and the point of the whole
exercise is that there is one.

The emitted section carries the licence *text*, not a licence label. Neither
frontend family declares a Reserved Font Name today; the next OFL font somebody
adds may, and a label would drop that.

WHAT IT CANNOT SEE

A font fetched at runtime, a font inside another package's wheel, and a font
embedded in a binary blob are all invisible here. This walks tracked source.
