"""A bill of quantities has one state set, and everything that writes it agrees.

``BOQ.status`` is a free ``String(50)``, so nothing in the database constrains
it. The only constraint is ``BOQUpdate``'s pattern, and the only writers that
meet it are the ones going through the API. The seeders write the column
directly and so are never checked at all.

That is how the product came to ship a state it could not reach. The demo
seeder wrote ``"approved"``; the schema permits ``draft``, ``final`` and
``archived``; and the one act that approves a bill - ``POST /boqs/{id}/lock``
- records the approver in ``approved_by`` / ``approved_at`` and sets the
status to ``"final"``. So bills existed in a state with no transition into it
and no transition out of it, while ``archived``, which the schema permits and
``PATCH /boqs/{id}`` can reach, was written by nothing.

The two halves below have to be read together. One says the permitted set is
exactly ``draft | final | archived``; the other says every status literal
written anywhere in the application is in that set. Either alone is satisfied
by widening the pattern until the seeded data validates, which would enshrine
whatever the seeder happened to do as the specification.

    cd backend
    python -m pytest tests/modules/boq/test_boq_status_set.py -v
