"""PG: the file manager lists takeoff's own store alongside the documents area.

The takeoff module keeps its documents in ``oe_takeoff_document``. The
"open from project files" dialog listed ``oe_documents_document`` and nothing
else, so a plan open in the takeoff viewer could not be found by name in a
dialog that called itself "project files" - two stores, one label, and the
user told something false.

The fix federates on the server: ``list_project_files`` collects the takeoff
store as the ``takeoff`` kind, which is the discriminator the caller groups by.
These properties need a real cluster because they are all database-level - the
project scoping of two independent tables, the role lookup behind the module
permission, and the duplicate suppression that keeps a blob shared by both
stores from being counted twice.

Gated by ``OE_TEST_DB=pg`` (see conftest).
