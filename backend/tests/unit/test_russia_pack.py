"""The Russian pack, and the seams it has to hold together.

A country pack states the same fact in several files by necessity: the engine
holds the code pattern because a rule compiles it, the manifest holds it
because the onboarding wizard renders it, and the reference document holds it
because a person reads it. Copies drift silently, so each pair is compared here
rather than trusted.

Two of these cases are not about this pack at all and are here because this
pack is what exposed them. One walks the project screens' copies of the
classification registry: a standard the backend resolves and no screen offers
is unreachable, and a value a screen writes that the backend cannot resolve
falls into the default without saying so. Both happened. The other asserts that
the Russian markup stack is reachable, which lives with its own suite.

No database and no application settings: the manifest is imported directly and
everything else is filesystem and JSON.
