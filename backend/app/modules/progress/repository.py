    """Return the ORDER BY that puts the winning progress entry first.

    Progress entries are append-only: a mistake is corrected by recording a
    NEW entry, so the reading that counts is the LATEST one, never the
    largest. The tiers are:

    1. ``seq DESC`` - the database-assigned insertion counter. Strictly
       increasing per INSERT, NOT NULL and unique, so it is a TOTAL order:
       the row appended last always wins, including for rows written inside
       one transaction where no timestamp can separate them.
    2. ``recorded_at DESC``
    3. ``created_at DESC``
    4. ``id DESC``

    Tiers 2 to 4 are unreachable while ``seq`` is populated, and are kept only
    as a defensive fallback. They are not the guarantee; ``seq`` is.

    Why the timestamps could not do this on their own: ``recorded_at``
    defaults to the DB's ``now()``, which in PostgreSQL is the TRANSACTION
    timestamp and is therefore identical for every row one transaction
    writes, and ``created_at`` is a Python ``datetime.now()`` whose
    granularity is ~1 ms on Windows against ~1 ns on Linux, so it ties on a
    coarse clock. With both tied the winner used to fall to a random uuid4 -
    stable, but arbitrary, which meant a bulk-imported correction won only by
    luck. See migration ``v3258_progress_entry_seq``.

    meaningful against a total order: ``recorded_at`` defaults to the DB's
    ``now()``, which in PostgreSQL is the TRANSACTION timestamp, so every
    entry one write appends shares it, and a bulk field import appends many.
    Ordered by the timestamp alone the database may arrange the tied rows
    differently for each OFFSET it serves, so a walk through the pages can
    return one entry twice and never return another, with each page looking
    correct on its own.

    ``seq`` is NOT NULL and unique per INSERT, so ending on it makes the
    order total. That is the property this tuple exists to hold, and the one
    ``test_progress_entry_page_walk`` asserts: the last key must be a column
