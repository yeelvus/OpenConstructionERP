// Case: "Reach practical completion and settle the final account" (GB).
//
// Practical completion is the hinge of a British building contract: it starts
// the rectification period, releases retention and stops damages running.
// The case keeps the defects and the money on the same set of dates, so the
// final account is arithmetic rather than archaeology. Content strings are
// key plus inline English default and live only here.

This case runs the sequence from the snagging list to the agreed final account, keeping the defects and the money on the same dates, because the second half of the retention and the last defect notice are the same event seen from two desks.",
