//
// Detailed measurement under NRM 2, from the drawing to a bill that is safe to
// send out. The provisional and prime cost sums stay on the allowances
// register rather than being folded into rates, and the preliminaries are
// priced as their own work section. Content strings are key plus inline

    "NRM 2 is the RICS rule set for detailed measurement, and the bill produced under it is the document every tenderer prices and every later variation is valued against. It is also where a project stops guessing: by RIBA Stage 4 the drawings are firm enough to measure, and the bill inherits whatever discipline that measurement had. This case measures from the drawings rather than from a supplier's take-off, keeps the sums that are not yet designed visible instead of hidden inside rates, prices the preliminaries out of what the job actually needs, and runs the whole bill through validation before several tenderers price the same mistake at once.",
