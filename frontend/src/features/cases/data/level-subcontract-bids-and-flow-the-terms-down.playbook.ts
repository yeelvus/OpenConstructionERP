// Case: "Level subcontract bids and flow the terms down" (CA).
//
// An award is a gate, not a button. The distinctive step is the one where the
// product declines to proceed because a required document is not valid on the
// award date, and the wording of that step matters more than anywhere else in
// the Canadian set: the check is a check AT AN INSTANT. "Valid on the award
// date" is true; "compliance verified" or anything implying cover for the whole
// contract period is not, and the difference is the one a caption would quietly
// erase. Content strings are key plus inline English default and live only here.

    "An award is a gate rather than a button, and it is guarding two things at once. The low bid is regularly the one that left the most out, which is not dishonesty but two readings of the same drawings, and the difference only becomes visible when the scopes are set side by side and the gaps are priced. The second thing is quieter: a certificate that lapsed last month is still in the folder looking current, and the moment to catch it is before the subcontract exists, because afterwards the leverage is gone and the exposure is yours. Worth stating accurately rather than dramatically, since the dramatic version circulates widely and is not true anywhere in the country: what a missing workers compensation clearance exposes a contractor to is the subcontractor's unpaid premiums, not the cost of an injury. That is real money and it is enough of a reason on its own.",
