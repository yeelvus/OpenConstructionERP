"""Money inside a module's validation message is rendered, never interpolated raw.

The core rules were fixed first. The module rule sets carried the same defect:
a ``Decimal`` dropped straight into the sentence reaches the reader as
``1234567.89`` with no thousands separator and no currency, or as ``1E+3`` once
the Decimal has normalised itself. ``_fmt_money`` is the house renderer and
these tests assert the *rendered sentence*, so putting the raw value back turns
them red.

Two boundaries are pinned here as hard as the fixes are:

* **A quantity is not money.** Hours worked, planned quantities, reuse counts
  and performance indices stay bare numbers. Every pin uses a four-digit
  figure, because a pin on ``5`` cannot tell a conversion from a no-op while a
  pin on ``1234`` catches both the grouping and the added decimals.
* **A currency is taken from the record in hand or not written at all.** Where
  the payload carries no currency the amount is grouped and left uncoded rather
  than given an invented one, and that no-code rendering is pinned too.

No database: every rule here reads a plain dict out of ``ValidationContext``.
