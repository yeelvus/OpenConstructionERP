"""Teams data access layer.

All database queries for teams, memberships, and visibility restrictions live
here. No business logic - pure data access.

Every restriction query is scoped by ``project_id`` through a join on
``Team.project_id``. That is not an optimisation: it is what stops a row
written against a team in one project from changing what anyone sees in
another. A caller that hands this layer an ``entity_id`` without the project it
belongs to cannot get a restriction answer, by design.
