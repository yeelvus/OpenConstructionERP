"""The two properties ``tests/_pg.py`` exists to provide, asserted directly.

Both are expensive enough to be tempting to weaken, and both fail silently when
weakened, which is why they are pinned here rather than trusted to the suite.

**Every test database is bounded against producing no verdict.** A test that
hangs returns nothing at all: nothing passes, nothing fails, nothing turns red,
and the silence reads exactly like health. It hangs in one of two shapes and
they need different bounds. A statement that runs too long is caught by
``statement_timeout``. A transaction left open with nothing running is invisible
to it, because no statement is executing, and is caught by
``idle_in_transaction_session_timeout``. That one TERMINATES the session rather
than cancelling a statement, and the difference matters to whoever reads the
failure: PostgreSQL names the reason in its own log, but the client is simply
disconnected, so under asyncpg the test reports ``connection is closed`` and
nothing more. It converts a hang into a failure; it does not convert it into an
explanation. ``lock_timeout`` covers neither: it bounds waiting for a lock. Above all three sits a per-test
kill that takes the process without naming statement or session, and only in CI:
``addopts`` carries no ``--timeout``, so a local run has nothing above these
bounds at all.

The idle bound is here because measurement showed the existing one was aimed
elsewhere. ``conftest._bound_idle_transactions`` reads ``DATABASE_SYNC_URL``,
which names the maintenance database, so its 300s landed there - correctly, and
usefully, since ``app.database.engine`` is bound to that same URL - while
``oe_test_unit`` and every clone read ``0``. That is worth stating plainly
because the function is careful in every other respect: it even reads its value
back, and it correctly verified a bound that was in force on the wrong database
for this suite's purposes.

A bound nobody reads back is not a bound, so these tests ask the server for both
values, over each of the four ways ``_pg.py`` hands out a connection, rather
than trusting the ``ALTER DATABASE`` to have landed.

**A throwaway database is genuinely throwaway.** ``isolated_engine`` clones a
database per call, which is the dominant cost of the suites that use it, so
"just widen the fixture scope" is a standing proposal. It is unsafe, and
measurably so: pointing all 16 ``isolated_engine`` unit files at one shared
database (and, separately, at one per module) failed the same 7 tests in
``test_erpchat_feedback``, ``test_match_analytics`` and
``test_partner_pack_full_install_stream``, every one of them on a count that had
absorbed a previous test's rows - ``assert 8 == 4``, ``assert 3 == 1``,
``assert 0 == 15``. Every leak was inside a single file, so module scope is no
safer than session scope. ``test_postgres_migrator_indexes`` raises the stakes
past rows: it drops indexes to simulate an old install, so what leaks there is
the schema.

A suite passing after such a change would not have proved anything - the tests
would simply never have read each other's leftovers. So the check below reads
them on purpose, and carries its own teeth: it asserts the leftovers ARE visible
when the database is reused, so the isolation half cannot pass by being blind.

    ``statement_timeout`` cannot see this. It runs only while a statement does,
    and this session has none - it is holding a transaction open and waiting,
    which is exactly the shape ``transactional_session`` keeps every test in and
    the shape a cross-loop wait produces under ``isolated_database_url``.

    The idle is a Python sleep, not ``pg_sleep``: ``pg_sleep`` is a running
    statement and would be caught by the other bound, proving nothing about this
    one.

    **What the caller actually sees is NOT the server's message.** PostgreSQL
    logs "terminating connection due to idle-in-transaction timeout", but it
    then closes the socket, and asyncpg reports the next statement as
    ``InterfaceError: connection is closed``. Measured, not assumed - this test
    was first written to assert the server's wording and failed against a bound
    that had worked perfectly. So the reason lives in the PostgreSQL log, and
    what reaches pytest is only that the connection died.

    That makes a message assertion worthless on its own: any dropped connection
    produces it. So causation is established by a CONTROL instead. The same
    connection, the same open transaction and the same two-second idle are run
    twice, and the only difference between them is the bound. Under a bound the
    idle does not exceed, the statement must succeed; under one it does exceed,
    the statement must fail. Without the control half, this test would pass on a
    machine that simply drops connections.

    Its own engine, with ``NullPool``, disposed at the end. This bound
    TERMINATES the session rather than cancelling one statement, so the
    connection comes back dead rather than clean, and the ``SET LOCAL`` plus
    rollback that the statement test uses cannot apply - there is nothing left
    to roll back on. Handing that corpse to another test through a shared pool
    would be the same leak this file exists to catch.
