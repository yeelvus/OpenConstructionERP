"""Alembic migration environment​‌‍⁠​‌‍⁠​‌‍⁠​‌‍⁠.

Auto-discovers all module models via Base.metadata.

What actually builds the schema
-------------------------------
``Base.metadata.create_all()`` builds the schema and is the source of
truth for its shape. Alembic does not build it. Alembic records which
revisions are considered applied, and applies the ones that a database
has not seen yet.

Every fresh install takes the ``create_all`` path, including installs
that run ``alembic upgrade head`` and never boot the app:
``_is_fresh_blank_db`` detects an empty database on entry and
``_bootstrap_fresh_db`` short-circuits to ``create_all`` plus a stamp at
the head. The migration chain is not walked. This is not a fallback for
an unusual case, it is what happens every time.

The chain does not walk from base
---------------------------------
It cannot. The root revision ``129188e46db8_init_create_all_tables`` has
an empty body — its ``upgrade()`` is ``pass`` — so nothing creates the
tables that every later revision assumes. 93 tables are never created by
any revision (``oe_users_user``, ``oe_assemblies_component``,
``oe_costs_item``, ``oe_dwg_takeoff_drawing_version``, ...); they exist
only in ``Base.metadata``. A walk from base dies within a handful of
revisions on ``no such table``. Even with the tables supplied it stops
again on a type conflict, because ``create_all`` renders identity
columns as ``varchar(36)`` while 53 revisions declare native
``postgresql.UUID``, and the foreign key between them is rejected.
``tests/unit/test_migration_uuid_convention.py`` freezes that set so it
stops growing.

Making the chain walkable was measured and deliberately not done. The
short-circuit above is what keeps every supported install working, so it
is load-bearing, not a workaround awaiting removal.

The population this does not serve
----------------------------------
A database that has ``oe_*`` tables but no ``alembic_version`` row is
neither fresh nor stamped. ``_is_fresh_blank_db`` correctly declines to
short-circuit it, so alembic tries to walk the chain from base, and that
walk fails. This is a real state — an install whose stamp never landed.

The fix is to stamp it rather than migrate it. The tables are already at
the current schema, so record that fact::

    alembic stamp head

Do not run ``alembic upgrade head`` on such a database expecting it to
repair itself; it will fail partway and leave the transaction rolled
back.
"""

# Known and permitted differences between the two schema-building paths.
#
# A database built by create_all and one built by walking the chain do not
# agree in the places below. They are recorded rather than fixed, because the
# chain is not walked by any supported install, which makes them latent
# forever rather than blocking. Do not file these as bugs, and do not "fix"
# one half without the other - the two names below are both live, in different
# populations.
#
# Constraint names, where a migration hardcoded a name the metadata naming
# convention would have generated differently:
#   v3258  uq_progress_entry_seq
#            vs uq_oe_progress_entry_seq
#   v3157  fk_qms_itp_item_predecessor
#            vs fk_oe_qms_itp_item_predecessor_itp_item_id_oe_qms_itp_item
#   v2b0   ck_oe_dashboards_preset_sync_status
#            vs ck_oe_dashboards_preset_ck_oe_dashboards_preset_sync_status
#
# Sequence ownership: v3258 creates its sequence with OWNED BY, create_all
# creates a standalone sequence. Dropping the column therefore drops the
# sequence on one path and leaves it on the other.
#
# Tables only the migrations create, absent from Base.metadata and so absent
# from every create_all install:
#   oe_tender_addendum    (v3085_tendering_addendum_leveling)
#   oe_translation_cache  (v280_translation_cache)
#
# Columns only the migrations add, absent from create_all:
#   oe_boq_boq.tax_rate            oe_projects_project.unit_system
#   oe_tendering_bid.leveled_amount    oe_tendering_bid.leveling_notes
