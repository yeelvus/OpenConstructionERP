"""The change order audit trail says who submitted and approved it.

``submitted_by``, ``approved_by`` and ``rejected_by`` are free-text columns and
the demo estate writes a user id into all three. The audit cards under a change
order printed the column as it stood, so the line under "Submitted" read
``3f2b8c1e-9a44-...`` - on the one screen whose whole job is to show who signed
off a cost change.

These cases hold the resolved names on the wire. They also hold the two things
that are easy to lose while adding them: a page must not cost a query per row,
and an id nobody answers to must not come back as though the order was never
submitted.

Run:
    python -m pytest tests/unit/test_change_order_party_names.py -q
