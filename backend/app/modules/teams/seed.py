"""Demo roster for a project: the people a job of this kind actually carries.

A roster screen with nothing on it teaches nobody what a roster is for, so the
demo project ships with one. What is seeded is a small, deliberately ordinary
site team: the client side, the main contractor's staff, and two subcontractor
gangs with a foreman each. Enough that the trade filter, the "who is in charge"
question and the ticket-expiry warning all have something to say.

Seeded people are roster lines only. Not one of them is given a login or a team
membership, so the demo cannot hand anybody access to anything - which is also
the clearest possible illustration of what a roster line is.

Idempotent: the seeder returns immediately when the project already has roster
lines, so re-running boot enrichment never doubles the site team.

Names, firms and ticket kinds are invented. Any resemblance to a real firm is
accidental, and none of them is a product on the market.
