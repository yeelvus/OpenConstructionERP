"""Pure derivation engine for the basis-of-estimate.

Turns the finished estimate contents (a flat list of BOQ position dicts) into a
structured, editable basis-of-estimate: the inclusions, exclusions and
assumptions that qualify what an estimate does and does not cover.

The engine is deliberately stdlib-only - no ORM, no app imports - so it loads on
a bare interpreter and can be unit tested without a database or the FastAPI
dependency graph. The service layer feeds it plain dicts and persists whatever
it returns.

Two derivations happen here:

* :func:`derive_trades` reads which work sections (trades) are present, absent or
  flagged in the estimate. A trade is keyed on the DIN 276 main cost group
  (an open classification standard already used across the platform); a position
  with no classification is matched on its description keywords as a fallback so
  a BOQ imported without cost codes still yields useful coverage.
* :func:`draft_basis` turns that coverage into the three qualification lists. A
  present trade becomes an inclusion, an expected-but-absent trade becomes an
  exclusion, and each quality flag (unpriced lines, missing quantities,
  provisional sums, work marked "by others") becomes an assumption. A fixed set
  of standard estimate qualifications is always drafted so the document reads
  like one an estimator would hand a client.

Every drafted line carries a deterministic id so a regenerate is stable and the
UI can key, reorder and toggle items without server round-trips.

        pricing_base_date: Optional date the priced rates are current to; drafts
