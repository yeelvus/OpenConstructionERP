# DDC-CWICR-OE: DataDrivenConstruction - OpenConstructionERP
"""The temporary-works, forms and portfolio demo seeds must fill, once, coherently.

All three shipped routed, permissioned and empty, and the seeders that fix that
share the same ways of being wrong - none of which shows up as a non-zero exit
code:

* they write nothing at all, because the demo marker that keeps a customer's
  live project safe also excludes the fixture the test runs against, and a
  suite asserting "at least three rows" passes on a seeder gated down to none;
* they double the register on the second boot, because idempotency in this
  codebase is per loop rather than per seeder;
* they write rows that are individually valid and collectively nonsense. On a
  safety register that is temporary works bearing load with no permit in force.
  On a form it is worse, because a submission whose answers do not match its
  template is invisible in the list and wrong the moment somebody opens it.

Every coherence assertion runs through the module's own judge -
``register.build_report``, ``validate_submission_answers``,
``build_visible_tree``, ``compute_node_cpm`` - rather than restating the rule
here. A rule restated in a test passes on data the application would reject.
