/**
 * `en-US.ts` holds only the words American practice names differently. Every
 * other key it does not carry has to be answered by `en.ts`, or an American
 * reader loses about 32,000 strings the moment they pick the locale.
 *
 * That property is a claim about i18next's resolution order, not about the file,
 * and it is invisible on screen: every call site in this codebase passes a
 * `defaultValue`, so a key that resolves and a key that fails outright both
 * render the same English text. The assertions below therefore call `t()` with
 * no `defaultValue` at all, which is the only way the two outcomes differ - a
 * failed lookup returns the key itself.
 *
 * The bundles are read from source and evaluated rather than imported, for the
 * reason `localeKeyResolution.test.ts` gives: these files are megabytes of
 * object literal and the vitest transform pipeline times out on them.
