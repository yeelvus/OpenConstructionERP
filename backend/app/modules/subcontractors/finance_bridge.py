"""Where subcontract money meets the payables ledger.

Each payment application is a bill from the subcontractor, so approving one
raises a payable, and paying it books the gross as spent. The retention on it
is held from what we pay, so the payment holds it back and the payables
retention ledger shows it held.

Everything here writes through the caller's session. Nothing commits, so the
subcontract, its invoice and the budget move in one transaction or not at all.

The budget is finance's: ``FinanceService.sync_project_budget`` works out what
a subcontract has committed and spent from the agreement, the contract and
their invoices, so nothing here writes a budget row. This module only tells it
when one of those moved.
