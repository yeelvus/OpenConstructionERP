# DDC-CWICR-OE: DataDrivenConstruction - OpenConstructionERP
"""The handover-side demo seeds must fill their registers, once, and coherently.

Closeout, commissioning and construction control all shipped routed,
permissioned and empty. The three seeders that fix that share the same ways of
being wrong, and none of them shows up as a non-zero exit code:

* they write nothing, because the self-gate that keeps a customer's live project
  safe also excludes the demo estate;
* they double the register on the second boot, because idempotency in this
  codebase is per loop rather than per seeder;
* they write rows that are individually valid and collectively nonsense - a
  package reporting a completeness its slots do not support, a system signed off
  while a critical deficiency is open, a lab result that passed on a number
  outside the limit it was judged against.

The third one is what these tests are really for, and each coherence assertion
runs through the module's own judge - ``completeness_pct``, ``compute_readiness``,
``compute_tolerance_result``, ``validate_gates`` - rather than restating the rule
here. A rule restated in a test passes on data the application would reject.
