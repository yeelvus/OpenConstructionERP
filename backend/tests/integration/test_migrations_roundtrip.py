"""Alembic up/down round-trip tests (Wave 3-D / Task #237).

Goal: catch the "missing or broken downgrade()" CI bug class — a
recent migration whose ``downgrade()`` is empty or doesn't reverse what
``upgrade()`` did. The cheapest way to surface that is to run
``upgrade -> downgrade -> upgrade`` cycles on a fresh PostgreSQL DB.

Schema-creation reality (see ``app/main.py`` ~L1395):
  * The init revision ``129188e46db8`` is intentionally a no-op — its
    docstring says "Tables are created by SQLAlchemy at app startup".
  * The app boots by running ``Base.metadata.create_all()`` first,
    *then* ``alembic upgrade head`` (Alembic only carries column-level
    or new-table deltas after the metadata create).
  * Therefore plain ``alembic upgrade head`` on an empty DB doesn't
    work — e.g. ``v270_position_version_column`` does
    ``inspector.get_columns("oe_boq_position")`` which raises
    ``NoSuchTableError`` because that table comes from create_all,
    not from a migration. This is **expected** project behaviour, not
    a bug to fix here.

Test strategy (mirrors production, isolated per revision):
  1. ``Base.metadata.create_all()`` to lay down the schema at head.
  2. ``alembic stamp head`` to mark all migrations as applied.
  3. For each recent revision ``R``:
     a. ``stamp R`` - move the version marker to exactly R without
        touching the schema (already at head from create_all).
     b. ``downgrade R^`` - run *only* R's own ``downgrade()`` (one step).
     c. ``upgrade R`` - run *only* R's own ``upgrade()`` (one step back).
     d. Assert: post-cycle schema matches pre-cycle schema.

  The earlier design downgraded the whole chain head->R^ then re-upgraded
  to head, which dragged in every legacy migration body between head and
  R^. On PostgreSQL a single broken legacy downgrade aborts the
  transaction and masks the revision actually under test. Isolating to
  R's own one-step cycle attributes any failure to R and nothing else.

Isolation: every test gets its own throwaway PostgreSQL database
(created from scratch, dropped on teardown). ``DATABASE_SYNC_URL``
is monkeypatched so that Alembic's ``env.py`` targets the throwaway
DB, not the dev/production database.

PostgreSQL-only revisions that require extensions or dialect features
unavailable in the unit cluster can be added to ``PG_DOWNGRADE_BROKEN_REVS``
with a one-line reason each; they will be xfailed rather than skipped so
any unexpected recovery is surfaced.

Runtime: ~5-15 s per parametrized rev on a warm interpreter. Tier
``integration``.

# ``v41_contract_original_value`` used to sit in the dict above and no longer

# It is a merge node: ``down_revision`` is the tuple
# ``(v41_coordination_thresholds, v3324_buyer_selection_currency)``, and the
# cycle asks for a one-step downgrade to ``parent[0]``. Alembic must also
# un-apply everything reachable only through the other parent, so the one step
# walks 222 revisions - measured as ``ancestors(parent[1])`` minus
# ``ancestors(parent[0])`` over all 359 files, not read off the error. Recognise
# that class by comparing the two parents' ancestor sets before reading the
# error, because the error always names a stranger.
#
# The three failures, in the order they surfaced, each hidden by the one before:
#
# 1. ``cannot drop index uq_oe_service_contract_number because constraint ...
#    requires it`` in v3101. Repaired;
#    ``test_no_downgrade_drops_an_index_a_constraint_owns`` is the live guard.
# 2. ``DatatypeMismatch`` on the way back up, in
#    v3104_propdev_broker_escrow_pricematrix_hierarchy and fifteen siblings,
#    which declared identity columns as native PostgreSQL uuid while the parents
#    they reference render as ``character varying(36)``. Repaired - and then ten
#    more were repaired that this walk never reaches. Re-running the walk finds
#    one revision per run; measuring every merge span found the rest at once,
#    and five of those ten hang the same foreign key onto a varchar parent. The
#    live guard is ``test_no_revision_inside_a_merge_span_declares_a_native_uuid``
#    below, and the allowlist in ``tests/pg/test_migration_uuid_convention.py``
#    shrank from 50 to 24.
# 3. Two swallowed errors that poisoned the transaction rather than the
#    statement that met them: v3234's ``CREATE EXTENSION pg_trgm`` on a cluster
#    that does not ship pg_trgm, and v3273's side connection blocking on a lock
#    its own migration held. Both repaired in their own bodies.
# 4. Two columns the chain still creates that the models no longer carry,
#    ``oe_boq_boq.tax_rate`` and ``oe_projects_project.unit_system``. Not an
#    upgrade/downgrade fault: both bodies are correct and idempotent, and both
#    revisions are simply older than the model decision that retired the column.
#    Only a walk this long reaches that far back. They are recorded in
#    ``CHAIN_ONLY_COLUMNS`` with the reason each column is dead, because
#    dropping a column from a deployed database is a data decision rather than
#    a test fix.
#
# The shape to carry away is that an expected failure hides the next one. Each
# repair moved the error to a revision that had been failing all along and had
# never been reported, because the walk had never reached it.

#  Static guard: no downgrade may drop an index a constraint owns

#  PostgreSQL refuses ``DROP INDEX x`` when x is the index backing a
#  constraint: "cannot drop index x because constraint x on table t requires
#  it". A migration hits that whenever it creates uniqueness as a plain unique
#  INDEX - the portable spelling, because SQLite has no
#  ``ALTER TABLE ADD CONSTRAINT`` - while the model declares the same name as a
#  ``UniqueConstraint``, so ``Base.metadata.create_all`` builds a real
#  constraint and the index of that name belongs to it.
#
#  The guard below is what replaced an xfail entry. An xfail is a live signal
#  only while it is failing; once the body is repaired the entry has to go, and
#  removing it leaves nothing watching the shape. This asserts the condition
#  PostgreSQL actually enforces, so it also catches the regression from the
#  other side: a model that later turns a plain ``Index(unique=True)`` into a
#  ``UniqueConstraint`` puts an existing, untouched migration into the
#  colliding set and turns this red without anyone editing a migration.
