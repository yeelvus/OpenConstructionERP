"""Project scoping of the drawing-sheet register, asserted at the route.

The register now has a screen of its own - an index, a detail drawer and an
insights band - and every number on it comes from one of the eight
``/api/v1/documents/sheets/`` endpoints. Each of those handlers calls
``verify_project_access`` in its own body rather than through a shared
dependency, so the guard is written once per route and a route can be added
without it. ``tests/modules/test_documents_security.py`` covers the rule by
calling ``verify_project_access`` itself, which is the router's logic re-typed
in the test: it cannot see whether any route wired the call. These tests drive
the real ASGI app, so a handler that forgets the guard fails here.

Two details are what make the assertions mean anything.

The attacker is a ``manager`` carrying every ``documents.*`` permission.
``RequirePermission`` runs before the handler body, so an attacker without
those permissions is turned away by RBAC with a 403 and never reaches the
project check - the refusal would look right and prove nothing about scoping.
With the permissions granted, the only thing left that can refuse is the
project guard, and every refusal is asserted as exactly 404, the shape
``verify_project_access`` raises for "missing" and "denied" alike.

Every refused URL is also requested by the project owner. A 404 from a mistyped
path is indistinguishable from a 404 from the guard, and the positive control is
what tells the two apart.
