"""The rule that lets the de-brand code name the things it is de-branding.

A gate that asks only whether a forbidden name is present convicts the three
files that exist to remove it. ``app.modules.formwork.debrand`` holds the old
catalogue names because the repair needs them as search keys, the frozen
revision that renames the same rows holds them for the same reason, and the
migration round-trip test seeds them so that it has something to prove was
renamed. Those files are about the names. Any other file that carries one is
using it.

The usual way to tell those apart is a list of blessed paths, and that list is
how a gate dies. It grows by one every time somebody is blocked, nobody
re-reads it, and after a while the list decides what ships instead of the rule.
So the gate draws the line on a property of the file's own content: a file that
renames a thing has to say what it renames it to, and a file that merely
mentions it has no reason to. A denied token is passed over only where the plain
descriptor it is renamed to also appears, and only for that one pairing.

The load-bearing test here is the second one. The first shows the three subject
files scanning clean, and on its own that means nothing at all - a gate that had
stopped detecting these tokens entirely would pass it just as well. The second
takes the pairing away and requires the same three files to be convicted, which
is what makes the first one evidence. That is also the shape of the ordinary
file the rule has to catch, expressed in real content rather than an invented
line: identical text, minus the fact that it states the replacement.

Nothing in this file spells a brand out. The real-tree tests read the tokens
from the repository, and the mechanism tests use invented ones, so this file
cannot become the leak it is guarding against.
