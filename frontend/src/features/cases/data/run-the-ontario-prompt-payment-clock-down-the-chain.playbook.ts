// Case: "Run the Ontario prompt-payment clock down the chain" (CA, Ontario).
//
// This case is Ontario and says so, because the statutory clock it runs is
// Ontario's. The split down the middle of it is deliberate: the owner-to-
// contractor clock is computed from the regime, and the seven-day pass-through
// to each tier below is not, which the regime's own notes state in as many
// words. So the computed dates and the entered dates sit on different screens
// and the copy never implies the clock cascades by itself. Wording follows the
// field names the screen shows rather than the sentence the statute uses: the
// due date is the day of receipt, and 28 days is the final date for payment.
// Content strings are key plus inline English default and live only here.

    "Ontario's Construction Act has run a prompt-payment regime since 1 October 2019, with major amendments in force from 1 January 2026, and its timelines are mandatory: section 6.9 applies the whole Part notwithstanding any other agreement, so a contract cannot lengthen them. The shape is one date and a tree of consequences. A proper invoice is defined by statute and is deemed proper unless the owner objects in writing within seven days saying what has to be corrected. Payment falls due on receipt of that invoice, the final date for payment is 28 calendar days later, and the owner has 14 calendar days to serve a notice of non-payment stating the amount withheld and the reasons. Miss that 14-day window and the invoice must be paid in full, which is the whole leverage of the scheme. Every reference to days in this Part is to calendar days rather than business days. Once paid, a contractor has seven days to pay each subcontractor, and that seven-day step repeats at every lower tier with its own notice sequence. Work in Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba or British Columbia falls under that province's own Act or, where none is yet in force, under the terms of its own contract, and those count differently, so pick the regime your contract actually falls under before relying on any date.",
