"""Which of the two schema facts ``/api/health`` is entitled to degrade on.

The product never runs ``alembic upgrade``. The schema moves through
``create_all`` and the boot heal, so the recorded revision falls behind on a
normal, correct upgrade the moment a release adds any revision at all. While
``alembic_head_matches`` degraded the status, every upgraded install reported
``degraded`` for the rest of its life over a stamp, and an aggregate with a
permanently active cause is not a signal any more. That is not a prediction: it
was observed hiding a total frontend outage, because ``status`` was already
pinned to degraded and could not move when ``frontend_dist_present`` went false.

So the stamp is published as a fact and degrades nothing, and the question that
does degrade is asked directly instead: do the models and the database still
agree. The heal can finish without raising and still leave them disagreeing,
because it enforces a NOT NULL only when a default exists to backfill the rows
already in the table.

The stamp half is written differentially - the same application answered twice,
once with the head check saying true and once false - because the status of a
test application depends on things this test does not control, such as whether
a frontend build is on disk. Asserting ``status != "degraded"`` outright would
pass or fail for reasons that have nothing to do with the change. Asserting
that flipping the field does not move the status is the actual claim.
