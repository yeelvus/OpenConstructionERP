// Case: "Check the RBQ subclass and price GST and QST in parallel" (CA, Quebec).
//
// Two things make a Quebec bid different from the same bid anywhere else in the
// country, and neither of them is a translation: a contractor licence is issued
// by class AND subclass, so holding one is not holding the other, and the two
// sales taxes are parallel rather than stacked. The case is built around those
// two and nothing else, because they are what a product built for another
// market gets wrong. Content strings are key plus inline English default and
// live only here.

    "A licence in Quebec is issued by class and subclass, and the subclass is what says which work is permitted: 1.3 covers buildings, 1.4 covers roads and mains, and a firm holding one is not licensed for the other however current its licence looks. The taxes work the same way, differently from the rest of the country: GST at 5 percent and QST at 9.975 percent are both computed on the pre-tax price, giving 14.975 percent in total, and QST is administered by Revenu Quebec rather than by the federal agency. Software written elsewhere gets both of these wrong in the same way, by checking that a thing exists rather than checking what it is. A licence that exists and does not cover the scope is a problem you inherit, and a QST computed on a GST-inclusive figure is half a percent of the contract you either give away or never collect.",
