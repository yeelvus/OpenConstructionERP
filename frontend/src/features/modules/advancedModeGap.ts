/**
 * How many sidebar entries Simple mode keeps out of reach.
 *
 * Enabling a module on the Modules page writes `module_preferences`, but a nav
 * row carrying `advancedOnly` (or sitting in a group carrying `hideInSimple`)
 * is filtered out by `Sidebar.tsx` before the module gate ever runs. The two
 * rules are independent: `passesRowGates` in `Sidebar.tsx` asks
 * `isModuleEnabled`, `visibleGroupItems` there asks the mode, and a row has to
 * clear both. So a user in Simple mode can switch a module on, watch the toggle
 * turn green, and still find nothing new in the menu, with no surface anywhere
 * saying why. A company profile with a workspace (`workspaces.ts`) is the
 * exception: its Simple mode keeps every other row under "More modules".
 *
 * These counts turn that invisible rule into a number the page can state out
 * loud. They are computed from `navGroups` at call time rather than stored as
 * a constant: the catalogue grows every release, and a hardcoded figure would
 * drift silently, which is the exact failure this notice exists to prevent.
