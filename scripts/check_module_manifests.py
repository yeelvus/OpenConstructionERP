"""Fail if a directory under backend/app/modules has no manifest.py.

The module loader finds modules by looking for a manifest. `ModuleLoader.discover`
walks each module root and `_discover_in` keeps a directory only if it holds a
`manifest.py`; a directory without one is skipped by a bare `continue`, with no
log line, no warning and no error.

That silence is the whole reason this gate exists. Every other way a module can
be wrong is loud: a manifest that raises on import gets a `logger.exception`, a
manifest with no `ModuleManifest` in it gets a `logger.warning`, an unresolvable
`depends` entry gets a warning from `resolve_order`. Only absence is quiet, and
absence is the one case where a module that is missing looks exactly like a
module that was never written. There is no diagnostic to grep for, because
nothing is emitted.

What absence costs, when the directory is a real module:

  * it is not in the registry, so `GET /api/v1/modules` does not list it and the
    admin enable/disable UI has no row for it;
  * its `router.py` is never mounted, so every endpoint in it answers 404 in
    production while the file sits in the tree looking implemented;
  * its `models.py` is never imported, so Alembic autogenerate never sees the
    tables and a fresh database does not have them;
  * nothing can declare it in `depends`, because there is no name to depend on.

Three directories are exempt today and each is a genuine support library: pure
Python domain math, no router, no ORM. See ALLOWLIST below for the per-entry
reason. The exemption is not taken on trust - `_exempt_premise_holds` rechecks
the claim on every run, so the day one of them grows a router or declares a
table the allowlist stops covering it and this gate fails. An allowlist that
never rechecks why it exists is just a list of names.

Scope, stated so nobody reads more into a green run than it earns: this checks
that a manifest is PRESENT. It does not check that the manifest is valid. A
`manifest.py` that raises on import, or that defines no `ModuleManifest`, passes
this gate and still leaves the module unloaded - loudly, in the log, which is a
different problem with a different signal.

Run from anywhere:

    python scripts/check_module_manifests.py

An optional argument scans a different directory instead, which is what the
gate's own negative-control test uses so it never has to touch the real tree:

    python scripts/check_module_manifests.py /path/to/fixture
