"""Backup export/restore service.

BUG-018 root cause and fix
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The original handler returned ``StreamingResponse(io.BytesIO(zip_bytes))``
*and* declared no request body. Two things conspired to produce the
empty-zip symptom:

1. ``_RejectNonFiniteJSONMiddleware`` (a pure-ASGI body rewriter in
   ``main.py``) drains the request body, then returns
   ``{"type": "http.disconnect"}`` on the second receive() call so the
   downstream app sees a single replayed body chunk. Starlette's
   ``StreamingResponse`` listens for that disconnect concurrently with
   its body iterator and *cancels the iterator* the moment it arrives.
   With no JSON body the middleware never engaged and the iterator
   completed normally - explaining why ``POST /export/`` worked when
   the body was omitted but produced ``Content-Length: 0`` whenever a
   ``Content-Type: application/json`` body was attached.

2. The handler also accepted no documented body, so the OpenAPI surface
   was empty and clients had no way to know which fields were
   meaningful.

The fix builds the archive into a :class:`tempfile.SpooledTemporaryFile`
(in-memory below 16 MiB, spilling to a temp file above) so memory stays
bounded for installations with large CWICR catalogues, then promotes
that to a named on-disk temp file and returns it via
:class:`fastapi.responses.FileResponse`. ``FileResponse`` performs its
own file-handle streaming and is unaffected by the disconnect-after-
replay quirk that broke ``StreamingResponse``.

# Per-user ownership scope for every backup table.

# A backup is the requesting user's own data, not the whole instance. Both
# export (which rows to dump) and restore in ``replace`` mode (which rows to
# delete before re-importing) MUST use the exact same scope, or they diverge
# dangerously: the original code exported a per-user subset but deleted every
# row of every table on restore, so a single user restoring their own backup
# wiped every other user's data. The scope below makes the two symmetric.
#
# Ownership is project-rooted. Every row is reachable from the requesting user
# either directly (``users`` / ``ai_settings``) or through the project graph
# (``projects.owner_id`` -> children by foreign key). Predicate kinds:
#   ("self",)              -> id == user_id            (the users table)
#   ("eq", "<column>")     -> <column> == user_id      (direct owner column)
#   ("in", "<fk>", "<key>")-> <fk> IN (ids owned in parent backup_key)

    Runs inside the caller's transaction: the caller commits on success and
    rolls back on a raised :class:`RestoreError`. ``merge`` (the safe default)
    adds rows whose id does not already exist and deletes nothing. ``replace``
    first clears the caller's own rows, and is refused with a ``RestoreError``
    whose ``stage`` is ``"guard"`` unless the account is empty, because a project
    delete cascades in the database far beyond the backed-up tables and would
    destroy data a backup cannot rebuild (see ``_account_has_restorable_data``).

    Import is best-effort per row: a row that violates a constraint is skipped
    with a warning rather than aborting, so the import side is not strictly
    all-or-nothing, though the replace clear and the final commit are. The
    ``users`` and ``ai_settings`` tables are never touched (see
    ``RESTORE_SKIP_KEYS``) and every imported row's ownership is forced to
    ``user_id`` (see ``remap_owner_refs``) so a backup lands cleanly under the
    restoring account and never under the id an archive claims.

    When ``file_key_sink`` is given, the storage keys referenced by successfully
    imported rows are collected into it, so the caller can restrict file restore
    to exactly the blobs those rows own.
