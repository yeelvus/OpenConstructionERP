"""How a holiday answer was arrived at, not only what it was.

``_get_holidays`` used to collapse four situations into one ``frozenset``:
covered and complete, covered but outside a curated window, not covered at all,
and a computation that raised. The last was swallowed into an empty set by a
bare ``except Exception``, and since ``is_working_day`` turns the set into a
``bool``, a broken holiday computation made every weekday a working day with a
log line as the only trace. A log is not something a caller can branch on.

Three empty sets, three meanings. A jurisdiction with genuinely no holidays is
an answer. A jurisdiction nothing covers is a weaker answer, the international
default. A jurisdiction whose holidays could not be computed is not an answer at
all. The old code produced identical bytes for all three.

The two axes are asserted separately on purpose. China in a year past its
curated table is the case that matters: the country is fully covered and the
year is not, so a single flag keyed on the country would report it green. That
is why :func:`app.core.provenance.weakest` exists and why it is tested here.

Coverage answers whether rows are present, and does not absorb accuracy. A
holiday whose date is computed but whose length is a stand-in is a third axis,
not a hole in the first two, so it is a fallback on ``holiday_extent`` while
jurisdiction and year both stay declared. Bending ``partial`` to carry it would
have made one slot answer two questions resolved two different ways. See
``_EXTENT_STANDINS`` for why the axis and its tokens are named for the
mechanism: absence has to mean "no stand-in we know of" and never "verified",
because nothing in this module has been verified.

Mutation matrix, measured across this file, ``test_calendar.py`` and
``test_calendar_nigeria_bulgaria.py``, which is the whole of what reads the
holiday tables:

    baseline                                       152 passed
    restore the swallow (except -> empty set)        9 failed, 143 passed
    raise but still cache an empty answer            5 failed, 147 passed
    treat a curated-window miss as complete          4 failed, 148 passed
    call every shared table a synonym (AT as DE)     1 failed, 151 passed
    forget the synonym table (GB falls back to UK)   1 failed, 151 passed
    call an uncovered country declared               4 failed, 148 passed
    drop one Gulf country from the span registry     3 failed, 149 passed
    call every uncomputed extent a computed one      8 failed, 144 passed
    restore the hijri swallow (out of range -> [])   5 failed, 147 passed
    stop enforcing the japanese formula window       3 failed, 149 passed
    drop Nigeria from the hijri-dependent set        2 failed, 150 passed
    restored                                       152 passed

The source was restored to a byte-identical sha256 after every mutation. The
kill counts differ from each other on purpose: a uniform number across eleven
mutations would mean everything fires on any change, and would look just as
green.

Two of these come in opposed pairs on purpose. A shared holiday function can be
wrongly called a synonym or wrongly called a fallback, and an empty set can be
wrongly called an answer or wrongly called nothing; a guard that is only hard in
one direction leaves the other as the way in.

The second mutation is the one a partial fix would produce: the first call
raises and every later one returns a plausible empty set from the cache. It is
caught only because the failure paths are asserted twice rather than once, at
both the resolver and the ``is_working_day`` level.
