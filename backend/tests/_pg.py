"""PostgreSQL test-isolation helpers.

The backend runs only on PostgreSQL, so the test suite does too. ``conftest``
provisions a cluster for the session (an embedded PostgreSQL 16 when no
``DATABASE_URL`` is set, otherwise the operator/CI-supplied instance). This
module hands out isolated, throwaway databases on that cluster for the unit
fixtures that historically built their own ``create_async_engine(":memory:")``
SQLite engine.

Isolation is fast because the full schema is materialised into a template
database exactly once per session; each fixture then clones it with
``CREATE DATABASE ... TEMPLATE`` (a file copy, no ``create_all`` round-trip)
and drops the clone on teardown.

Usage (drop-in for the old in-memory SQLite fixture)::

    from tests._pg import isolated_engine

    @pytest_asyncio.fixture
    async def session():
        async with isolated_engine() as engine:
            factory = async_sessionmaker(engine, class_=AsyncSession, expire_on_commit=False)
            async with factory() as s:
                yield s

# Seconds one statement may run on a test database before PostgreSQL cancels it

#
# This is the bound on the failure mode nothing else in this file covers. A test
# that hangs inside a query produces no verdict at all: pytest reports neither a
# pass nor a fail, nothing turns red, and silence is indistinguishable from
# health - which is strictly worse than a red, because a red gets read. This
# tree has already seen the shape once, on the admin connection rather than in a
# test: see the note on :func:`_connect_admin`, where a whole-suite run stalled
# inside ``CREATE DATABASE ... TEMPLATE`` until the per-test timeout killed the
# process.
#
# Locally there is no per-test timeout to fall back on. ``addopts`` in
# ``pyproject.toml`` carries ``--strict-markers`` and ``-p no:anyio`` and no
# ``--timeout``, so a hang in a developer's run has nothing above it at all.
#
# The number is a budget, not a tuning knob, chosen the same way
# :data:`LOCK_TIMEOUT_S` below was, and measured over the populations it
# actually governs rather than over per-test durations. Every statement issued
# on an ``oe_test_*`` database was timed, on a workstation running six other
# agents, so these are upper bounds. The three databases are counted apart
# below, because one merged "slowest statement on ``oe_test_*``" figure cannot
# say which population it came from, and they turn out not to be alike:
#
#   ``oe_test_unit``, reached through ``transactional_session`` - 9648
#   statements, slowest 0.9129s. This is the population that matters: 148 files
#   under ``tests/unit`` alone go through it, against one long-lived database.
#   The 9648 were collected over a deterministic quarter of it, 37 of those 148
#   files, so read 0.9129s as the maximum over that quarter and not over all
#   148. Its slowest statement is application traffic, an INSERT, not schema
#   work. The slowest DDL on it is 0.5166s, a ``CREATE INDEX`` from the
#   ``create_all`` in :func:`_ensure_unit_db`, which is the only ``create_all``
#   that reaches this database - :func:`create_module_tables` goes through
#   ``app.database.engine``, and that engine is bound to ``DATABASE_URL``, which
#   names the maintenance database and not this one (measured, not assumed).
#
#   The per-test clones (``isolated_engine``, ``isolated_database_url``) - 60
#   statements, slowest 0.0665s. Small on purpose, and worth knowing why: a
#   clone arrives from the template with the schema already in it, so no code
#   path in this file issues DDL against one. The heaviest statement in this
#   census's clone bucket is a probe table that
#   ``tests/unit/test_pg_fixture_isolation.py`` creates itself.
#
#   ``oe_test_template`` - 3495 statements, slowest 0.237s. Listed so the
#   numbers add up; it is NOT governed by this bound, see :func:`ensure_template`.
#
# Sixty seconds is 65x the slowest statement any bounded database produced, so a
# slow-but-healthy machine cannot trip it. Take the merged figure across all
# three databases instead and the same arithmetic says 200x, which is the error
# the split above exists to prevent: the clones and the template are both far
# cheaper per statement than ``oe_test_unit``, so pooling them flatters the
# headroom on the one database that actually carries the load.
#
# Note what is NOT in that population, and must not be: ``CREATE DATABASE ...
# TEMPLATE`` is a single statement copying 5122 files. It runs on the admin
# connection, which this bound deliberately leaves alone - see
# :func:`_bound_timeouts` - and that exemption is load-bearing, not cautious.
# The bare statement measured 34-59s on this machine, the same order as this
# bound, so bounding the admin connection would risk cancelling the clone that
# every isolated test is waiting for.
#
# It sits deliberately ABOVE ``LOCK_TIMEOUT_S`` and below every other bound in
# play. Where a lock wait is the cause, the shorter and better-named "lock
# timeout" still fires first and keeps its clearer message; this catches what
# ``lock_timeout`` does not, a statement that is running rather than waiting.
#
# The full ladder, read off the workflow files rather than assumed, because the
# per-test kill differs per lane and none of them is 60s:
#     lock_timeout                        30s   (LOCK_TIMEOUT_S, below)
#     statement_timeout                   60s   (here)
#     pytest --timeout, Backend CI       300s   ci.yml, `tests/unit`, signal
#     idle_in_transaction_session        300s   conftest, and see below
#     pytest --timeout, nightly          900s   ci-full.yml, thread
#     pytest --timeout, local           none    no --timeout in addopts
# Sixty seconds is under every one of them, so "canceling statement due to
# statement timeout" is what reaches the log, attached to the test that caused
# it, rather than a killed process or nothing at all.
#
# One caveat worth writing down rather than implying: the 300s
# ``idle_in_transaction_session_timeout`` that ``conftest`` sets does NOT reach
# the databases this file hands out. Measured - ``pg_db_role_setting`` holds it
# against ``postgres`` only, and both ``oe_test_unit`` and a fresh clone read
# ``0`` for it. That bound covers the app engine and the admin connection. It is
# not a second net under this one.
#
# A test that legitimately needs longer can raise it for its own session with
# ``SET statement_timeout``: a per-session value overrides the per-database one
# set here, and of the two live timeouts the shorter fires. That is how
# ``tests/pg/test_dwg_conversion_row_lock.py`` keeps working - it sets
# ``lock_timeout = '500ms'`` on its own connection and asserts on that message.
STATEMENT_TIMEOUT_S = 60

# Seconds a session may sit inside an OPEN transaction issuing nothing before
# PostgreSQL terminates it. It logs "terminating connection due to
# idle-in-transaction timeout" server-side, but the client only finds out that
# its connection went away: under asyncpg the next statement raises
# ``InterfaceError: connection is closed``, with no mention of the cause.
# Measured, not assumed. So this bound turns a hang into a failure, which is
# what it is for, but the reason has to be read out of the PostgreSQL log.
#
# A different net from the one above, catching what it cannot see.
# ``statement_timeout`` only runs while a statement does; a transaction that is
# open and idle is, to it, a session doing nothing wrong. That shape is not
# hypothetical here - :func:`transactional_session` deliberately holds an outer
# transaction open for the whole of every test that uses it, and
# :func:`isolated_database_url` exists precisely because callers run several
# event loops against one database, which is how a cross-loop wait wedges with a
# transaction open and no statement in flight.
#
# ``conftest._bound_idle_transactions`` already sets a bound of this kind, but
# measurement showed it lands on the maintenance database only: it reads
# ``DATABASE_SYNC_URL``, which names ``postgres``, so ``pg_db_role_setting``
# carries it against ``postgres`` and both ``oe_test_unit`` and a fresh clone
# read ``0``. That bound is worth keeping - ``app.database.engine`` is bound to
# the same URL, so it does cover the application's own sessions - but it never
# reached the databases this file hands out. This is the same placement error
# the statement bound above had to avoid, and it is fixed the same way: on the
# database, in :func:`_bound_timeouts`, next to its sibling so the two cannot
# drift apart.
#
# 240 and not the 300 ``conftest`` uses, deliberately. Backend CI runs
# ``tests/unit`` with ``--timeout=300 --timeout-method=signal``, so a bound of
# 300 would race the process kill at the same number and the outcome would be a
# coin flip between a named failure and an unnamed dead process - which is the
# outcome this whole guard exists to prevent. 240 leaves a clear minute in which
# PostgreSQL's named error can reach the log first. It stays above
# :data:`STATEMENT_TIMEOUT_S` so that a session which is running rather than
# idle still reports the more precise "statement timeout".

    nothing running. They are set together, in one place, on purpose: they guard
    two halves of the same failure - a test that produces no verdict - and if
    one were applied at a call site the other had not reached, the gap would be
    invisible until something hung in exactly that half.

    Set on the DATABASE rather than through ``connect_args`` on one engine,
    because the engine is not the only thing that connects. ``isolated_engine``
    builds one, ``isolated_database_url`` hands out a bare URL for callers to
    build their own (one per event loop, by design), and application code under
    test opens its own sessions against the same database. A per-database
    setting covers all three; a ``connect_args`` on ``isolated_engine`` would
    cover the first only, and would read as working right up to the first hang
    in the other two.

    It has to be set on the CLONE and not on the template. ``CREATE DATABASE ...
    TEMPLATE`` copies the template's contents, not its per-database settings:
    those live in ``pg_db_role_setting`` keyed by database OID and the new
    database gets a new OID. Measured on this cluster - a parent set to
    ``4321ms`` produced a clone reading ``0`` - so a bound placed on the template
    would be silently absent on every database a test ever touches.

    Deliberately NOT set on the admin connection. That one issues ``CREATE
    DATABASE ... TEMPLATE``, which is a single statement whose cost is a 5122
    file copy: it was measured at 42-59 seconds on a loaded workstation, so a
    bound of this size there would kill the fixture rather than a hang.
    ``_connect_admin`` already carries ``lock_timeout``, which is the bound that
    fits what can actually go wrong on it.

    Warns rather than raises, for the same reason as its sibling
    ``conftest._bound_idle_transactions``: a managed PostgreSQL can refuse
    ``ALTER DATABASE`` to a non-owner. A freshly created clone is always owned by
    the role that created it, but ``_UNIT_DB`` outlives the run and can already
    exist under a different owner on a reused external cluster - and turning
    that into a hard failure would take down every test in the suite over a
    guard, which is a worse outcome than running without it. Absence does not go
    unnoticed: ``tests/unit/test_pg_fixture_isolation.py`` reads the value back
    from the server on all four entry points, so a refusal surfaces as a handful
    of named red tests instead of a suite that silently believes it is bounded.

# ── Per-module tables on the SHARED database ───────────────────────────────
# The helpers above hand out a private database, which is the better answer
# whenever a test can take one. A few modules cannot: their code under test
# spawns its own sessions from the global ``async_session_factory``, so the
# fixture has to seed the very database that factory is bound to.
#
# Those modules reached for ``Base.metadata.drop_all`` + ``create_all`` in a
# per-test fixture to get a clean slate, and at this size that is a trap twice
# over.
#
# It is enormous. ``Base.metadata`` holds whatever every module imported so far
# registered - 624 tables on a full run - so the cost is set by the rest of the
# shard rather than by the test doing the work. One rebuild was measured
# holding 19529 locks in a single transaction and taking 78 seconds, once per
# test. That is what exhausts the server's shared lock table (asyncpg
# ``OutOfMemory``, "You might need to increase max_locks_per_transaction"), and
# it is why the casualties moved between nightly runs: they are whichever
# schema-rebuilding tests happen to share a shard, never a fixed list of names.
#
# It is also fragile in a way that costs hours. DROP TABLE needs ACCESS
# EXCLUSIVE, which conflicts with the ACCESS SHARE an ordinary reader holds, so
# a single connection left ``idle in transaction`` by a failing test blocks the
# next test's drop forever - no statement timeout covers a lock wait. On the
# nightly cross-OS run that wedged the job at 9% of the suite until the
# per-test timeout killed the process 900 seconds later.
#
# So build the module's own tables once and delete rows between tests. DELETE
# needs only ROW EXCLUSIVE, which does not conflict with a stray reader, so a
# leaked connection can no longer stop the suite.


# Seconds any of this module's operations may wait for a lock before giving up:
# the per-test clear, the per-module `create_all`, and the admin connection that
# issues CREATE/DROP DATABASE. DELETE takes ROW
# EXCLUSIVE and so does not queue behind a stray reader, but it can still wait
# on the ROW locks of a transaction that WROTE the rows we are deleting - and a
# leaked transaction is exactly the shape that does. ``lock_timeout`` covers
# that too: PostgreSQL applies it while acquiring a lock on "a table, index,
# row, or other database object". The number is a budget, not a tuning knob.
# It has to be long enough that a slow-but-healthy CI machine never trips it,
# and short enough that a genuine wedge is a named failure inside one test
# rather than a job that runs to the 900-second per-test timeout and dies with
# no name attached, which is what the nightly did. Thirty seconds is two orders
# of magnitude above the observed healthy clear (0.38-1.63s) and one below the
# timeout that used to kill the process.
