; OpenConstructionERP - NSIS installer hooks
;
; Windows keeps an exclusive lock on a running .exe. If the backend sidecar
; (openconstructionerp-server.exe) is still running when the installer tries to
; overwrite it, or when the uninstaller tries to delete it, the operation fails
; with "file in use by another process". That is the reinstall error users hit:
; after the app is closed or uninstalled the sidecar can linger in the
; background, and the next install cannot replace the locked file until the
; process is stopped by hand in Task Manager.
;
; These hooks stop that process before the installer writes files and before the
; uninstaller removes them, so the file lock is gone by the time it matters.
;
; Two things they must not do, and used to.
;
; They must not kill processes that are not ours to kill. The old hooks ran
; `taskkill /F /T /IM <name>`, and /IM matches by image name across the whole
; machine: an elevated installer stopped that image in EVERY logged-in user's
; session, and in every other installation of the product on the machine.
; Matching on the executable path instead scopes the stop to the installation
; being worked on. Another install, in another directory, is now none of our
; business - which it always was.
;
; And they must not force-kill when they can ask. A forced stop is an unclean
; stop for the embedded PostgreSQL cluster the backend runs, so the next start
; has a write-ahead log to replay, which on a large database takes minutes and
; is what users have been reading as "the application backend did not start in
; time" after an upgrade. Closing the app's window instead runs the launcher's
; own exit path, which asks the backend to shut down cleanly. So: ask first,
; wait, and force only what is left.
;
; The path comes through the environment rather than being pasted into the
; PowerShell command, so an install directory containing a quote or a dollar
; sign cannot break the script that is supposed to protect it.
;
; The taskkill lines are the fallback for a machine where PowerShell will not
; run at all. They are narrowed to this user's own processes, so they can never
; reach into another user's session the way the original did - and they run ONLY
; when PowerShell could not be started, because the USERNAME filter makes
; taskkill resolve the owner of every process on the machine, which was measured
; at 55 seconds per call. An installer may not spend two minutes on a step that
; usually has nothing to do.

; One more thing this has to get right, and it is invisible from the source: an
; NSIS installer is a 32-bit process, so `powershell` on its PATH resolves under
; WOW64 to the 32-bit copy in SysWOW64 - and a 32-bit process cannot read the
; module list of a 64-bit one, so `(Get-Process).Path` is empty for every
; process this hook cares about. Measured, not reasoned: with redirection left
; on, the filter matched 0 of 1 running processes and the hook was a silent
; no-op. Turning file-system redirection off for the call gets the 64-bit
; PowerShell, which matched 1 of 1.

; The path filter above cannot reach one process that matters, and it is the
; process with the most to lose. The embedded PostgreSQL postmaster is not
; started from $INSTDIR: it is executed out of the temporary directory the
; onefile backend bundle unpacks itself into, so its path is under %TEMP% and
; the filter never matches it. What that costs is in the bug report it came
; from: after the app is gone the postmaster is still running, still holding
; the data directory and still holding the port, so the next install starts
; against a cluster it does not own, and an uninstall leaves a process behind
; with nothing left on disk to explain it.
;
; It is not enough to look for an image called postgres.exe. A developer
; machine or a server may well be running an unrelated PostgreSQL, and killing
; someone else's database because it shares an image name is the same mistake
; the old /IM taskkill made, one layer down.
;
; So the postmaster is identified the way PostgreSQL itself identifies it: by
; the pid file it writes into its own data directory. Line 1 is the pid and
; line 3 is the start time in Unix seconds. Reading that file names exactly one
; process, and it is by construction the postmaster of OUR cluster.
;
; Two guards sit on top of it, because a pid file outlives the process that
; wrote it. A stale file names a pid Windows is free to hand to something else,
; so the process found under that pid must still be called postgres, and its
; start time must still be the one the file recorded. A recycled pid fails the
; second check even when it passes the first.
;
; The data directory is resolved through the same three environment variables,
; in the same order, that the backend itself uses (OE_DATA_DIR, then DATA_DIR,
; then OE_CLI_DATA_DIR, then ~/.openestimate). A test asserts that order
; against the backend's own resolver rather than against a copy of it, so the
; two cannot drift apart quietly.
;
; This runs after the window has been asked to close, not instead of it. In the
; ordinary case the launcher has already stopped the cluster cleanly by then and
; there is no pid file left to act on. This is the last resort, and a forced
; stop here is still better than the alternative it replaces, which was leaving
; the postmaster running forever.

; Every one of these calls is bounded, and the reason is a bug report rather
; than a principle. nsExec waits for the child forever unless it is given
; /TIMEOUT, and the uninstaller waits for nsExec, and the installer waits for
; the uninstaller. So a PowerShell that never returns - a wedged host, an
; antivirus holding the image, a console that never gets a handle - stops the
; upgrade dead on the line "Closing OpenConstructionERP..." with no way out but
; the task manager. That is exactly what a user saw. On expiry nsExec pushes
; the string "timeout" rather than an exit code, which the caller below already
; reads as "not zero" and answers with the by-name fallback, so a timed-out
; PowerShell degrades into the slower path instead of into a hang.
;
; The numbers are bounds, not budgets. The window close already waits up to 15
; seconds inside PowerShell, and PowerShell itself can take several seconds to
; start on a cold machine, so 60 seconds is the first point at which the call
; is certainly not working rather than merely slow. The postmaster stop has no
; internal wait and gets 30. The taskkill fallbacks get 90 each because the
; USERNAME filter makes taskkill resolve the owner of every process on the
; machine, which was measured at 55 seconds on an ordinary desktop.
;
; One thing this cannot fix, and it is worth writing down because it is not
; visible from here. On an upgrade the new installer runs the PREVIOUSLY
; INSTALLED uninstaller, from PageLeaveReinstall, which happens before
; NSIS_HOOK_PREINSTALL exists to run. So the hook that decides whether an
; upgrade hangs is the one that shipped in the version already on disk, never
; the one in the installer being run. Every fix here reaches the upgrade AFTER
; next, and there is no earlier hook point to borrow: the template defines four
; and all of them are later than this.
