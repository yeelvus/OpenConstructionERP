// A total is written the way the column it sums is written.
//
// Measured on the published frames of /finance and /contracts, in German: the
// footer read `225.297,6 $` while the rows above it read `133.794,64 $`. One
// decimal against two, in the same column, on the two figures a reader is most
// likely to compare. On a euro project the same cell instead collapsed to
// `9,4 Mio. €`, and a four-figure total came out as `3088,4 $` - one decimal
// and no thousands separator - two rows under `3.013,85 $`.
//
// All three are one cause. The footers asked <MoneyDisplay> for `compact`, and
// that prop does two things at once: it turns on `notation: 'compact'` and it
// replaces the currency's own minor units with `[0, 1]` fraction digits. German
// has no short currency form below a million, so under a million the notation
// changes nothing and the digit override is all that survives - a full-length
// number written to one decimal, and, below ten thousand, without its grouping.
// Above a million the notation does fire and the figure collapses. Which of the
// three shapes a reader sees depends on the size of the total, so the same
// column disagrees with itself at different times of the project.
//
// The fix is not to make `compact` cleverer. It is that a column is compact all
// the way down or not at all, and a money column in a wide register is not.
//
// Two halves:
//
//   * the mechanism, rendered rather than argued: a compacted footer cannot
//     agree with the column above it, and this is stated as a property of the
//     rendered strings rather than as a quoted example, so it keeps meaning the
//     same thing when the amounts change;
//   * the census, because fixing the eleven footers that were wrong would leave
//     the twelfth free to be written the same way tomorrow.
//
// HOW TO WORK ON THE CENSUS, and this is not optional advice.
//
// A matcher that has never been shown to fail proves nothing when it passes. A
// green census means either "there is nothing to find" or "the reader went
// blind", and the two look identical from the outside. So the only way to
// learn anything about this file is to make the tree WRONG ON PURPOSE and
// watch: re-pin a formatter that was just fixed, run the census, and require
// it to name the file. If it stays green you have found a hole, not a clean
// tree.
//
// That method has caught this census twice, and neither time by reading it:
//
//   1. `statementAt` stopped at the first balanced bracket run, which for a
//      `function f(...)` is the PARAMETER LIST. Every function body came back
//      empty, so nothing could be convicted, and the census reported zero
//      offenders on a tree that held two. Closed by `declarationBody`, and
//      guarded by 'reads a function body past its parameter list'.
//
//   2. The body reader stopped one hop short of the engine. The BOQ resource
//      summary's footer names `fmtMoney`, a memo that delegates to
//      `createRSMoneyFormatter`, so the literal lived one call below. Reading
//      only the memo found no engine and CLEARED a surface that had been
//      deliberately re-pinned seconds earlier - the census went on calling it
//      "money and clean". Closed by expanding a body with the bodies of the
//      helpers it calls, and guarded by 'follows a helper that delegates to
//      another helper'.
//
// Both failures looked thorough. Both convicted nobody. Assume the next one
// does too, and go and break something to find it.

/* ── The second cause: a footer that owns its formatter ─────────────────────── */

/**
 * The census above finds one way a total stops agreeing with its column, and it
 * was green on a tree where a total was wrong.
 *
 * `compact` is a prop, and the leveling matrix never used it. Its footer built a
 * private `Intl.NumberFormat` pinned to zero decimals at both ends while the
 * cells above it were written to two, so a euro package printed `2.235 €`
 * directly under `1.234,50` - the sum rounded away from the very figures it
 * summed, in the same column. A matcher looking for the word `compact` cannot
 * see that, and this tree carries footers in twenty-six files.
 *
 * So this second census asks a different question, and asks it of the footer
 * alone rather than of the footer against its rows: does money reach this cell
 * through a formatter the file BUILT ITSELF with a hardcoded number of decimal
 * places? How many minor units a currency has is a property of the currency -
 * CLDR keeps it in `currencyData`, and `formatCurrency` and
 * `currencyFractionDigits` read it from there - so a digit literal written next
 * to money is a claim about every currency the screen will ever be handed, and
 * it is wrong for the yen, the forint and the dinar at the same time. Two rows
 * agreeing with each other is not the standard. Agreeing with the currency is.
 *
 * Handing `{ maximumFractionDigits: 0 }` to the SHARED formatter is not this
 * defect and is deliberately not flagged. That surface asked the resolver and
 * then asked it to round a summary, which is a display decision the resolver
 * validates and which leaves the symbol, the grouping and the locale correct.
 * The order-of-magnitude estimate does precisely that, in its rows and in its
 * total alike, and calling it a defect would be reading the literal instead of
 * the question the literal answers.
 *
 * The blind spot is named rather than implied. A money column that mentions no
 * currency anywhere near itself is indistinguishable in source from a column of
 * plain numbers, so this census cannot classify it as money and does not
 * pretend to. Those footers land in the `plain` bucket, which is printed, and
 * the count of money footers is asserted from below so the day the classifier
 * stops recognising money is a red day rather than a quiet one.

 * is simply resolved somewhere the matcher does not look. Left unannotated, the
 * honest limitation does the work of a hiding place - which is the exact
 * failure this whole file was written to prevent, one bucket over.
 *
 * Only the entries that format something are listed. The rest print raw counts
 * and have no formatter at all, so there is nothing in them to get wrong.
 *
 * This list has already earned itself once. `features/boq/ResourceSummary.tsx`
 * sat in `plain` reading as innocent: its formatter's body said nothing about
 * currency and its footer cell said only `total_cost`, so the matcher filed it
 * as a column of plain numbers while it was summing money at a pinned two
 * decimals. A hand pass found it, not the instrument. It has since been fixed
 * and now classifies as money and clean, which is why it is no longer listed.
 *
 * Keep the shape in mind when you add an entry: the bucket is still
 * STRUCTURALLY able to hide that exact defect again, because a helper can
 * always be written whose body names no currency. What bounds the exposure is
 * not the matcher but the test below, which refuses to let a NEW formatting
 * footer land here without a human writing down what they found.
