"""IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference) anti-regression, v2.6.43+.

Pins the router-level ``verify_project_access`` calls in the single-resource
GET / PATCH / DELETE handlers across both sweeps:

v2.6.43 sweep:
    - ncr.router.{get,update,delete}_ncr
    - inspections.router.{get,update,delete}_inspection
    - meetings.router.{get,update,delete}_meeting
    - punchlist.router.{get,update,delete}_item
    - risk.router.{get,update,delete}_risk
    - takeoff.router.delete_document

v2.6.44 sweep:
    - rfi.router.{get,update,delete}_rfi
    - submittals.router.{get,update,delete}_submittal
    - correspondence.router.{get,update,delete}_correspondence
    - transmittals.router.{get,update,delete}_transmittal
    - markups.router.{get,update,delete}_markup
    - changeorders.router.{get,update,delete}_change_order

Approach: AST-inspect the handler bodies to verify each one calls
``verify_project_access`` and accepts ``session: SessionDep``. This catches
silent regressions where a refactor drops the IDOR guard without
necessarily breaking any existing test (because the routes still 200 for
the legit owner).

The actual cross-user 404 behaviour is exercised end-to-end by
``backend/tests/integration/test_idor_cross_user.py`` (added in the same
sweep). This file is the cheap static guard.

Route census
------------
``ROUTER_HANDLERS`` is hand maintained, which used to mean a router could
grow a handler without growing a guard and nothing would say so.
``test_object_scoped_routes_are_all_pinned`` closes that: it reads the route
decorators back out of the same ``router.py`` files and requires every route
whose path template names a specific record (``/{ncr_id}``,
``/{transmittal_id}/recipients/{recipient_id}``) to be either in
``ROUTER_HANDLERS`` or in ``_NOT_ROUTER_GATED`` with a written reason.

What it reads is decorator declarations in ``app/modules/<module>/router.py``,
which as of this sweep is where all sixteen audited modules declare all of
their routes: none of them holds a second ``APIRouter`` elsewhere in the
package, and none registers a route through ``add_api_route``. A module that
started doing either would be invisible here.

Two further things it deliberately does not cover, so nobody reads it as wider
than it is:

* Routes that take no path parameter. ``GET /?project_id=...`` and
  ``POST /`` need a project check just as much, but their scope comes from
  the query string or the body and cannot be read off the path, so no
  honest predicate over route shape catches them. Many are pinned anyway;
  they are just not *required* to be.
* Modules outside ``ROUTER_HANDLERS``. The census iterates the audited
  modules, so a brand-new module arrives with no coverage at all. Widening
  it to all of ``app/modules`` would go red immediately and is a separate
  piece of work.

Everything here stays on the AST on purpose: no import of ``create_app``, no
database, no network, which is what lets this file sit in a blocking lane and
finish in seconds.
