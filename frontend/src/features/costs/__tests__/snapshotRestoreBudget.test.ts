// The vector snapshot restore button could not report success, in two
// independent ways, and both of them told the user the opposite of what had
// happened.
//
// The budget. `POST /v1/costs/vector/restore-snapshot/{db_id}` ran on the 45s
// default mutation budget. Server side that call downloads roughly 1.1 GB with
// a 600s budget and then hands the file to Qdrant with `timeout_s=1800`, and
// neither half watches the client - the download runs in an executor, the
// restore in `asyncio.to_thread`. So the browser aborted long before the work
// finished, and the abort was reported as "failed to load vectors" for a
// restore that was still running and would still land. `longRunning` alone
// would not have fixed it: five minutes against forty is still a lie, just a
// slower one.
//
// The field. The restore endpoint answers with `vectors_count` and carries no
// `indexed` field at all, while the neighbouring `load-github` endpoint answers
// with `indexed`. Both callers read `indexed`, so a finished restore of tens of
// thousands of vectors reported one vector on the setup page and "the backend
// indexed 0 vectors" on the modules page. TypeScript could not see it because
// the field was declared optional.
//
// Run: npx vitest run --pool=forks src/features/costs/__tests__/snapshotRestoreBudget.test.ts
