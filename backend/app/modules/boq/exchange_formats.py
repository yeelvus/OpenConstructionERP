"""The catalogue of bill-of-quantities exchange formats, by market.

A quantity surveyor does not think in file formats, they think in the
document their market uses. In Germany that is a Leistungsverzeichnis and
it travels as GAEB DA XML; in Spain it is a presupuesto and it travels as
a BC3; in Hungary it is a költségvetés and it travels as a workbook whose
columns are in Hungarian. Asking that person to choose between "GAEB",
"BC3" and "Excel" is asking them to translate their own job into ours.

This module is the list they should be shown instead: one row per market
document, carrying the countries it belongs to so the row can fly their
flag, and carrying enough truth about what we can do with it that the row
never promises more than the code delivers.

Nothing here declares a capability
----------------------------------

The temptation with a table like this is to write ``import_support =
"native"`` next to a format and move on. That value would be a mirror of
the importer registry, and mirrors drift silently: the day a reader is
added or removed, the table still says what it said, and no test fails
because nothing compares them. This repository has paid for that lesson
more than once, most expensively where a standards picker listed a
standard the backend could not store, and the mismatch surfaced as a
value falling back to a default without a word to the user.

So a catalogue row names a ``reader`` and a ``writer`` by ``format_id``
and stops there. Whether that reader exists is answered by looking in
``REGISTERED_IMPORTERS``; whether that writer exists is answered by
looking in ``REGISTERED_EXPORTERS``. Delete an importer and the rows that
named it drop to "assisted" on their own.

The same applies one level deeper for the workbook rows. A row saying we
read a Turkish költségvetés equivalent is only true if the spreadsheet
importer knows the Turkish words for quantity and unit price. It knows
which languages it covers, and publishes that as
``SUPPORTED_HEADER_LANGUAGES``, so a workbook row is native only when its
own ``header_language`` is in that set. Teach the importer a language and
the row changes by itself; that is the whole point.

The three levels of support
---------------------------

``native``
    We read (or write) the format's own container, or we read a workbook
    whose column headings are in a language the importer knows. What
    comes back is the file's own structure, not a guess.

``assisted``
    We have no reader for this shape, but the file is one the guided
    import can attempt: it walks the sheet, proposes a column mapping and
    a set of positions, and a human confirms every one of them before
    anything is written. Useful, and not the same thing as support, which
    is why it has its own word.

``none``
    We cannot take this file at all today. Rows in this state are still
    listed. A surveyor in Vienna is better served by being told plainly
    that we do not read ÖNORM A 2063 yet, and that GAEB DA XML is the way
    in until we do, than by not finding their format on the page and
    concluding the product is not for them.

# interchange file we would rather hand them that than a spreadsheet;
# then the market workbooks; then the formats that belong to everybody.
