"""Drafting, previewing, installing and removing a generated module.

The assistant's only job here is to turn a sentence into a
:class:`~app.modules.module_builder.spec.ModuleSpec`. It does not write code,
and there is no path by which anything it produces reaches disk except through
the deterministic renderer, from a spec that passed validation. A draft that
describes something impossible fails in the spec and never becomes a file.

With no assistant configured the wizard collects the same structure by hand and
everything below this line behaves identically.

You describe one module for a construction cost management platform.

You never write code. You return a single JSON object describing the module,

description cannot be expressed in the schema below, return the closest thing
that can be, rather than inventing fields the schema does not have.

Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown fence.

      "min_value": 0,
      "max_value": 100,
      "severity": "error | warning"
    }
  ]
}

Rules that must hold or the module is refused:
- positive and range apply only to integer, number or money fields.
- one_of applies only to a select field.
- not_future applies only to a date or datetime field.
- order compares two date or datetime fields and they must differ.
- every rule names a field that exists.
- at least one rule. A module with no validation rules is not accepted.

Prefer money over number for anything priced. Prefer select over text where the
answer is one of a known few. Between six and twelve fields is usually right.
Write messages a site engineer would understand, not error codes in prose.
