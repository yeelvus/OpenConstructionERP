"""A supplier invoice line can be attributed to the bill item it paid for.

Issue #454. The link from an invoice line to the cost spine has always existed,
and it has always been spelled ``cost_line_id``. Nobody entering a supplier
invoice thinks in cost lines; they think in the bill item the work was for, and
having to look the cost line up first is why 72 invoices on the reporter's
installation sit at project level with nothing attributed to anything.

So the line accepts the position and the service resolves it. Both refusals
matter more than the happy path: a position off the cost spine and a position
that contradicts an explicitly named cost line are the two ways this could
quietly post the money nowhere or somewhere wrong, and both come back as a 422
that says what to do instead.
