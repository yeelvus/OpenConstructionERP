"""The core party resolver, tested where it lives rather than through a caller.

``test_punch_assignee_names.py`` covers this logic through the punch list,
which is where it was written. It now serves inspections and deadlines as well,
and a rule tested only at one caller is tested at the caller that was already
right. So the guarantees every caller depends on are pinned here, against the
helper itself.

What is pinned:

* an id resolves against contacts and platform users both, because the column
  receives both, and the result is keyed by the value as it is *stored*, so a
  caller can look a row up without re-normalising;
* text that is not an id never reaches the database - a typed-in name is
  already the answer, and on PostgreSQL a name compared against a uuid column
  raises, which would turn a cosmetic lookup into a failed list request;
* an id that answers to nobody is absent from the result rather than present
  and empty, so the caller prints the record as having an owner it cannot name
  instead of blanking the cell or claiming it is unassigned;
* a whole page costs a fixed number of lookups whatever its length;
* each lookup runs in its own savepoint, so one that fails costs a name and not
  the caller's transaction. A bare try/except cannot give that back: a failed
  statement poisons the session until something rolls it back.
