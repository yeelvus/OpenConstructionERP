"""An approved, sent or paid invoice keeps what it charges, to whom and in which currency.

``update_invoice`` checked only that a status change followed the invoice
lifecycle. It never looked at the status the invoice was already in, so the
same PATCH rewrote the subtotal, tax, total, currency, counterparty and every
line of an invoice that had been approved, sent to the customer or paid,
including a receivable raised from a certified claim. The status table itself
already says a paid invoice only moves on to a credit note.

The edit form in the finance page sends every field back on each save, so the
refusal is about real changes: the stored figures sent back unchanged, a note,
a due date or a legal status move still go through.
