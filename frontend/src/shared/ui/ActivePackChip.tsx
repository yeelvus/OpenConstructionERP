/**
 * ActivePackChip — the top-bar readout of which regional pack is in use.
 *
 * A pack decides the workspace's currency, tax template, validation standards
 * and which modules are on. That is a large amount of behaviour to carry with
 * no visible statement of where it came from, and until now the header made
 * that statement only when a pack was applied: `PartnerLogoBadge` returns null
 * for `active: false`, and the header additionally gated it behind
 * `packActive`. Measured on a stock install, eighteen packs are on disk and
 * `active_slug` is null, so the header said nothing at all - which is the one
 * state where the reader most needs to be told, because "no pack" and "a pack
 * I have not noticed" look identical from inside the app and produce different
 * numbers.
 *
 * So this renders in both states and is deliberately NOT the co-brand badge.
 * `PartnerLogoBadge` can be dismissed for the session by product spec, which is
 * right for a partner's mark and wrong for a status readout: a reader who
 * dismissed the mark once would lose the answer to "which pack am I on" for the
 * rest of the session. The two live side by side, and this one is quiet enough
 * to sit next to it - tertiary text, no fill, no accent - because it is
 * reference rather than promotion.
 *
 * The empty state is a link rather than a label. Nothing else in the app tells
 * a first-time reader that country packs exist, and a chip that says "none"
 * without saying "none of eighteen" is a dead end.
