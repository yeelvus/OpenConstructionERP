"""The allowances demo seed hands every project a register of its own.

A demo estate in which two projects list the same allowances teaches the reader
that the data is generated, which is the one thing a demo must not say. The
database-side test asserts that on six seeded projects; it cannot assert it on
the eleven the estate actually holds, and while the register was sampled at
random it could not assert it at all - a sample only makes a repeat unlikely, so
a green run meant nothing in particular.

These are the properties stated over the selection itself, with no database in
the way, so they hold for every position rather than for the six a fixture
happens to build:

* no two positions produce the same register (the property the seed exists for);
* there are far more registers to hand out than there are projects to hand them
  to, which is the arithmetic underneath that property. A pool no longer than
  the estate cannot help but repeat itself;
* every register leaves at least one allowance untouched, carries all three
  kinds, and stops short of the whole catalogue (the properties the register has
  to keep while the first one is being widened);
* the size pool never reaches the ceiling, which is what flattened eight of
  eleven projects onto one length in the first place.
