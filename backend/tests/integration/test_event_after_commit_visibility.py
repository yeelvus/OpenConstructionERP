"""A cross-module subscriber must see the row the publisher told it about.

Every subscriber on the event bus opens its OWN session via
``async_session_factory()``. When the publisher is still inside an open
transaction, that second session is a second connection and cannot see the
parent row yet, so the subscriber's insert dies on the foreign key and its own
``except`` hides the loss. These tests hold that door open on purpose.

Why this lives in ``integration`` and not ``unit``: the two NCR bridge unit
tests replace ``async_session_factory`` with a fake session and stub
``publish_detached`` to ``lambda *a, **k: None``. A fake session takes the
immediate-run fallback and a stub that swallows its arguments accepts any
signature, so neither can witness *when* the publish happens. Only a real
PostgreSQL connection can: the subscriber is gated to PostgreSQL
(``_can_open_isolated_session``) and on SQLite returns before it writes
anything at all.

The sleeps are the experiment, not padding. The one before the commit gives a
detached subscriber a real chance to run while the parent is still invisible -
without it the test would pass for the wrong reason, having simply never let
the racing task start.
