"""Fail when NOTICE and backend/NOTICE have drifted apart.

Why this exists
---------------
``backend/NOTICE`` is a manual byte copy of the root ``NOTICE``. It exists only
because PEP 639 cannot reach outside the project root, so the wheel can convey
the notice only from a copy that sits beside ``pyproject.toml``.

Nothing stopped an edit landing on one side alone. The enforcement was a single
pytest, ``test_licence_text_ships.py::test_the_two_notice_copies_are_identical``,
which runs in the backend lane after a push. That is too late: the person who
edits the root file has usually finished and moved on by the time it goes red,
and the failure surfaces to whoever pushes next.

It is not hypothetical. Commits 9489d2b96 and 891d56ef0 each edited the root
copy and not the backend one, and the lane went red until 863076d86 restored the
byte copy. This script is the local check that would have caught both before
they were committed.

What it does
------------
Compares the two copies twice, because there are two different ways they drift
and checking only one of them misses the other.

**On disk.** The plain question, are these two files the same right now. This is
what catches the forgot-to-copy case: the root file edited, the backend copy
never touched.

**In the index.** The question that actually decides what lands, because a
commit is built from the index rather than from the working tree. This project
commits with ``git commit --only -- <explicit paths>``, which takes the working
tree state of the paths it is given and leaves every other path at HEAD. So both
files can be byte identical on disk while the commit about to be made carries
only one of them, and a disk-only check waves it through. ``--fix`` makes that
more likely rather than less, by tidying the disk and leaving the staging
untouched, so a gate that only reads the disk would bless the exact state its
own repair created.

Both comparisons normalise CRLF to LF first, the way the gating test does, so a
checkout with Windows line endings is not reported as drift where the test that
actually gates would pass. A gate stricter than the thing it guards is a false
alarm, not extra safety.

The index half is skipped, and says so, when there is no git repository or no
index entry for a path, so a plain run from a tarball still works.

    python scripts/check_notice_mirror.py          # report
    python scripts/check_notice_mirror.py --fix    # copy root over backend

The root file is the source. ``--fix`` copies it over ``backend/NOTICE`` and
never the other way, because the root copy is the one people edit and the
backend copy is the artefact. After a repair, stage both paths.

Exit codes
----------
0  the two copies agree on disk and in the index, or --fix reconciled the disk
1  they have drifted, on disk or in the index (and --fix was not given)
2  one of them is missing
