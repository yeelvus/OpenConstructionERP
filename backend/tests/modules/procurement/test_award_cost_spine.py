"""A tender award is an order, and it has to land on the cost spine like one.

Wiring the money link into the order form and the requisition covered what a
buyer types. It did not cover the largest single commitment the system makes:
awarding a tender turns a whole package into a purchase order in an event
handler that builds its line items itself, and that handler was putting the
bid line's ``position_id`` into ``wbs_id`` as text while leaving the money link
null. The package therefore landed on the project total and nowhere in the
breakdown, which is the same defect the order form had, on a larger number.

The handler opens its own session through ``async_session_factory``. These
tests hand it the rolled-back test session instead, so the assertions run in
the gated module lane rather than in an integration lane that blocks nothing.

They drive ``_create_po_from_award`` rather than the subscriber that wraps it.
The subscriber launches the work as a detached task and returns at once, so an
await on it proves nothing and, sharing one connection with the test session,
runs the two concurrently until asyncpg refuses. Awaiting the coroutine itself
is both the assertion that can be made and the only one that is sound.
