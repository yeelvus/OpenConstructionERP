"""Measurement (quantity determination) library.

Transparent, formula-based take-off: every quantity keeps the formula that
produced it, so the number can be checked and audited. The model is
country-neutral; REB 23.003 (DA11/DA12) and OENORM A 2063 are presets over it
(see ``presets.py``), and the same sheet works for a NRM or CESMM take-off or
an ad-hoc measurement anywhere.

Pure library (no manifest, no router of its own), Decimal-exact and ORM-free
like the ``price_breakdown`` and ``einvoice`` libraries.
