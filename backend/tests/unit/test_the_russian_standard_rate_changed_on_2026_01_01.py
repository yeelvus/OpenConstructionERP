"""Russia charges 20 % before 2026 and 22 % from 2026-01-01, and both halves are asserted.

The defect this pins
--------------------
Russia raised standard VAT from 20 % to 22 % with effect from 2026-01-01
(Tax Code article 164 as amended, sourced below). The seed file went on
shipping a single window at
20 % dated from 2019-01-01 with no ``effective_to``, so every Russian document
dated in 2026 was priced two points low, and had been for the eight months
between the change and the commit that added this file.

Why both directions are asserted, and why that is the point
-----------------------------------------------------------
The obvious repair is to edit ``20.0`` to say ``22.0``. It is wrong, and a test
that checked only the new rate would pass against it just as happily. Editing
in place leaves one open window running from 2019-01-01, so every Russian
document ever priced - all of 2019 through 2025 - silently re-resolves at 22 %
on its next read. Estimates and invoices already issued at the rate of their
day quietly change value. The date windows exist to stop exactly that, so the
2025 assertion below is not a courtesy check on old data: it is the half that
catches the wrong fix.

Read against the shipped file, not a fixture
--------------------------------------------
The rows come from ``seed_data/tax_configurations.json`` itself. A hand-built
fixture would let this file go green while the shipped data stayed wrong, which
is the vacuous pass the whole exercise is about.

Where the rate comes from
-------------------------
Not from anything already in this repository. The repository said 20 in five
places, consistently, and that consistency was the thing under suspicion rather
than evidence about Russian law. Grepping the Romanian rows teaches the file
format and nothing else.

* Federal Tax Service of Russia, "Taxes 2026", https://www.nalog.gov.ru/new2026/
  (read 2026-09-07). It gives the standard rate as "20% -> 22%" and states that
  the tax at those rates applies to sales of goods, works and services from
  1 January 2026. The calculation rate moves with it, 20/120 becoming 22/122
  and 16.67 becoming 18.03.
* The instrument that page implements is Federal Law No. 425-FZ of 28 November
  2025, amending parts one and two of the Tax Code, official publication number
  0001202511280017 on the state publication portal at publication.pravo.gov.ru.
  That identity is taken from the portal's index record. The law text itself
  did not load, so nothing here is quoted from it and the rate above rests on
  the tax service page.

The reduced rate did not move
-----------------------------
Sourced rather than inferred from the headline rate, because a reform that
raises the standard rate is under no obligation to leave the reduced one alone.
The same tax service page enumerates the 2026 rate changes and lists 22, 22/122
and 18.03 as changed while listing 10 as unchanged. Corroboration from that
same page, so not a second source: the 10/110 calculation rate stays as it is
while 20/120 becomes 22/122, which it could not do if the 10 had moved.
``test_the_reduced_rate_did_not_change`` below holds the shipped row to that.

Which date the resolver is handed, and how that was settled
------------------------------------------------------------
A dated window is only as good as the date it is queried with, and this file
used to record that question as open. It is closed: a bill of quantities is
taxed at its own base date. ``BOQService.apply_default_markups`` passes
``BOQ.base_date`` into ``_seeded_vat_rate``, which reads it through
``app.modules.boq.base_date.price_base_day`` - a day, a month, a quarter or a
year, each period read as its first day - and hands the result to ``resolve``
as ``on_date``. A value nothing can read still dates the bill today, because a
mistyped label must not stop a project being priced, but it is now logged
against the bill and reported by ``boq_quality.base_date_readable`` instead of
passing in silence. ``tests/unit/test_a_price_base_stated_as_a_quarter_dated_the_bill_today``
and the Israeli and Russian cases in
``tests/pg/test_a_bill_is_priced_at_its_own_countrys_vat`` hold that end to end.

What the decision does not claim is that the base date and the tax point are
the same thing in law. ``base_date`` is the price level reference, the date the
unit rates are indexed to, while the tax service wording keys the new rate on
realisation of the works from 1 January 2026 whatever date the contract
carries. Those remain two axes, and a bill indexed to 2025 prices for works
performed in 2026 is now seeded at 20 where the works themselves attract 22.
That is deliberate: the seeded number is a suggestion about the money the bill
is written in, and both the project's ``default_vat_rate`` and the bill's own
``tax_rate`` override it where the works say otherwise.
