"""The locale scripts under ``scripts/`` must be transparent to invisible characters.

Zero-width characters are invisible by construction, so every way of mishandling
them looks correct on screen. Three of those ways were live in this repository at
once, and none of them showed up in a diff, a review or a gate:

* ``scripts/i18n_extract.py`` decoded each value with the ``unicode_escape``
  codec, which reads a string's UTF-8 bytes back as latin-1. A zero-width
  character came out as three characters, and so did every Cyrillic, CJK and
  Arabic letter in the file.
* ``scripts/translate_mn_pass2.py`` and ``scripts/translate_mn_pass6_more_long.py``
  hold translation tables whose keys are English source strings. Some of those
  keys picked up a run of invisible characters from a mechanical pass over the
  tree. A key holding one cannot match the English string it is meant to match,
  so those entries were dead, and the scripts reported success while translating
  nothing.
* Every ``translate_mn_pass*`` script, and ``scripts/i18n_apply.py``, read the
  locale with ``Path.read_text`` and wrote it back with ``Path.write_text``.
  Both translate line endings, so a run that replaced nothing still rewrote the
  whole file - to CRLF on Windows, to LF everywhere else.

The assertions below compare code points and bytes, never rendered strings. A
rendered comparison is what let all three through.
