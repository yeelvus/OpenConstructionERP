"""Several modules fill one tool registry, and a name collision leaves no trace.

``global_tool_registry`` is a single process-wide dict of name -> tool, filled
by ``register()`` calls that run inside module ``on_startup`` hooks rather than
at import. ``ToolRegistry.register`` overwrites by name and returns ``None``, so
two modules registering the same name is not an error, not a warning, and not
visible in the registry afterwards. The only difference it makes is that every
agent listing that name in ``allowed_tools`` calls whichever copy the startup
order happened to run last, while both files go on reading as if each owned its
own tool.

That is live today. ``search_costs`` is registered by ``boq_drafter`` and again
by ``rate_benchmarker``; ``on_startup`` runs the drafter first, so the
benchmarker's copy is the one every agent gets, the BOQ drafter included. The
two implementations agree apart from the observation each hands back to the LLM
when the cost database is unreachable, so the live effect is that a drafter run
is told the rate could not be benchmarked while it is drafting a BOQ. It stays
that small only until somebody edits one of the two copies, which nothing here
or anywhere else would notice.

The collision is pinned rather than repaired because repairing it means either
deleting one of two live implementations or merging them behind one message,
and both are calls for the module's owner rather than for a test.

The other check here is that ``TOOL_PERMISSIONS`` in ``ai_agents/triggers.py``
never prices a tool nothing registers. Its scope is narrow on purpose. That map
is documented as listing the tools that perform or propose a privileged action,
while read-only tools are meant to ride ``DEFAULT_TOOL_PERMISSION`` with no
entry at all, so the absence of a name proves nothing and is not asserted on.
The presence of a name that resolves to no tool does prove something: the entry
was written to keep a specific permission attached to a specific tool, a rename
in the agent module detaches it silently, and the comment explaining the
arrangement goes on describing something that has stopped happening.

Two mechanics have to be respected or the file measures nothing. Registration
happens in function calls, so a probe that merely imports the agent packages
reports an empty registry and would report that as a finding. And an overwrite
is observable only while it happens, which is why the fixture records
registrations as they are made instead of inspecting the result.
