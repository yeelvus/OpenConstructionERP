"""Phone and address rules must say whose rules they are.

Fourteen countries have phone rules here and thirteen have address rules. Every
other country in the world is answered by a generic table, and until now the
answer said so nowhere: ``get_phone_rules("FR")`` returned the generic patterns
under ``country_code: "FR"``, and ``validate_phone`` stamped the requested
country onto a result the generic rules had produced.

The tests below are written so that they cannot pass against an implementation
that reports a fixed verdict. A covered country is asserted to be *declared*
rather than merely not-a-fallback, and an uncovered one is asserted to be
*fallback* rather than merely not-declared; an implementation that answered
UNAVAILABLE for everything would satisfy neither. Where the two cases diverge
they are asserted twice, once for what the value must be and once for what it
must not, because "not the old wrong answer" and "the right answer" are
different claims and only both together pin the behaviour.
