"""A table cell longer than its column must not be drawn over the column beside it.

These four documents give their tables explicit column widths, so they always
fitted the page and nothing ever looked wrong about their geometry. What they
also did was hand reportlab bare strings, and a bare string cell is drawn with
``canvas.drawString`` at the column's left edge and simply allowed to run on.
The column width decides where the grid line goes and has no say at all over
where the ink stops. So a certifier's practice name, a site address, an action
item written as a sentence, a subcontractor's name or a trade description would
be printed straight across the column beside it, over whatever that column was
saying, or past the edge of the sheet when it was the last column.

That is invisible to every check that reads the file rather than the page. The
text is all present, extraction returns all of it in the right order, the column
count is right, and the table's own bounding box is the size it was asked to be.
It is only wrong once someone looks at it, which is why the assertions here are
about where ink is drawn and never about which strings the file contains.

Each test names two columns by the text that starts them and asserts that
nothing drawn in the first reaches the second. The boundaries are read off the
page rather than restated from the source, so a change to the column widths
moves the boundary with it and the test keeps asking the same question. Widths
and font sizes are the product's own throughout; nothing here is rendered at a
width chosen to make the arithmetic easy.

# -- An action item longer than a page ---------------------------------------
#
# Wrapping a cell moved the failure rather than removing it. A value too long
# for its column used to be drawn on one line straight off the paper, silently;
# once it wraps, the row grows instead, and a single row taller than the frame
# is something reportlab refuses outright with a LayoutError, which reaches a
# user as a 500 on a document that had been rendering.
#
# Almost nothing can reach that. A punch list trade and category are
# String(100), a meeting location and title are String(500), and none of them
# comes close. MeetingActionItem.description is Text with no cap at all, and it
# is drawn in a narrow column on both the minutes and the export route, so it
# is the one field where a person typing a long paragraph can take the document
# down. The obligation tends to be in the last sentence of exactly that field,
# so truncating it is not an option: the row has to be allowed to split.
#
# The two documents have different geometry, 8pt on 10pt leading for the
# minutes against 9pt on 11pt for the route, so they ran out of frame at
# different lengths, roughly 2900 and roughly 2200 characters. That is why
# neither a single cap nor a fix to one of them would have done: the same
# meeting would render one document and fail the other.
