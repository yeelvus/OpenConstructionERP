# DDC-CWICR-OE: DataDrivenConstruction / OpenConstructionERP
"""An install instruction must be worded for the install that will read it.

Most remedies in this tree are written for a pip install, which is where most
of them are read. Inside the frozen desktop sidecar they are not merely awkward
but impossible: ``sys.executable`` is the application binary, so a pip command
feeds its own tokens back into this CLI. ``app.core.self_upgrade.repair_hint``
exists to answer that at runtime, and it takes two frozen wordings because the
two failures need opposite advice:

* ``DESKTOP_REPAIR`` when the named thing IS in ``requirements-desktop.lock``.
  The bundle ships it, so a bundle that cannot load it is damaged, and the
  reader must be sent to the installer rather than told to add what is already
  there. ``DESKTOP_NO_EXTRA`` would be a lie at these sites.
* ``DESKTOP_NO_EXTRA`` when it is not in the lock. A reinstall from the same
  installer carries exactly the same fixed set, so "reinstall" sends the reader
  round a loop that changes nothing.

Getting the constant backwards produces a message that is confidently wrong, so
the census below prints, per site, whether the named distribution is in the
lock. Choosing between the two is a reading of the call site and stays with the
author; what this file gates is that the choice was made at all.

What is in scope and why: a string that instructs somebody to install a NAMED
distribution or a NAMED ``openconstructionerp`` extra. Two deliberate exclusions,
both stated rather than listed, so that a new site cannot fall outside the rule
by being absent from a hand-maintained roster:

* Advice that only names ``openconstructionerp`` itself is the app-reinstall
  class, governed by ``FROZEN_REFUSAL`` and the upgrade endpoints instead.
* ``apt``/``brew``/``npm`` instructions are followable on a frozen desktop's
  host, because they do not run through ``sys.executable``. That boundary is
  the one ``repair_hint``'s own docstring draws.
* Prose that DESCRIBES an install instead of prescribing one. "a model can be
  resident even on an install where the shared path is never used" is the noun,
  and a register entry that happens to name a package is not a remedy handed to
  anybody. A determiner in front of the word is what tells the two apart.

Measured on 2026-08-29 against the tree: 34 sites in the population, all routed.
The figure was also 34 on 2026-08-23, under a detector that additionally counted
one register entry describing an install, so a number that matches is not by
itself evidence that the corpus and the reading of it both stood still.
A count on its own would let this pass by going blind, so the population size
carries a floor, the extractor's vocabulary comes from the lock and from
pyproject rather than from a regex guess after the word "install", and the
failure prints the offending sites by name.

The census is only half the proof. It reads source and can therefore show that
every remedy goes THROUGH ``repair_hint``; it cannot show what comes out the
other side, and a site that hands over the wrong constant satisfies the census
while telling a desktop reader something confidently false. So the second half
of this file runs a sample of the real producers under both installs, prints
both strings, and asserts the two frozen wordings are not interchangeable.

That half imports the application; the census half is pure file parsing and
stays that way, so a collection that cannot import the app still gets the
corpus-wide gate.
