"""Seven writes on global reference tables used to authenticate and stop there.

``POST``/``PATCH``/``DELETE`` on exchange rates, work calendars and tax
configurations each declared a ``CurrentUserId`` it underscore-prefixed and
never read, and carried no permission. Being logged in was the whole gate, so
any account of any role could rewrite the VAT rate and the currency conversion
that every tenant's estimates and invoices are computed from. The three tables
have no tenant, owner or project column, so there was no ownership check
underneath to fall back on either.

Two things have to be true for the fix to hold, and each is tested separately
because they fail independently:

1. The keys are REGISTERED. ``RequirePermission`` returns False for a key
   nobody registered, and admin short-circuits above that check, so a
   misspelled key produces a route that behaves as admin-only and that no
   admin-authenticated test can tell from a correct one. That is the
   post-mortem in ``app/core/module_router.py:44-49``, and it is why the
   assertions below use a NON-admin role: ``role_has_permission(Role.ADMIN,
   anything)`` is True by bypass and can never discriminate.
2. The routes ASK for them. Registration alone would pass every check in
   part 1 while the routes stayed open.
