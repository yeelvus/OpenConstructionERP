// Case: "Deduct CIS when you pay a subcontractor" (GB).
//
// The Construction Industry Scheme makes the payer responsible for a rate
// that depends on somebody else's verification status, and the domestic
// reverse charge sits on top of the same supply. The case works both out
// before the payment leaves rather than after. Content strings are key plus
// inline English default and live only here.

  longDescDefault:
    "Under the Construction Industry Scheme the contractor deducts tax from a subcontractor's payment and pays it over to HMRC, at nothing, twenty percent or thirty percent depending on how that subcontractor is verified. Deducting at the wrong rate is the payer's problem rather than the payee's, and it compounds every month until somebody notices. The domestic reverse charge sits on the same supply and moves the VAT to the customer for construction services reported under the scheme, stopping at the end user. Neither is difficult; both are unforgiving. This case gets them right on one payment and leaves behind the record the monthly return and the subcontractor's own statement are made of.",
