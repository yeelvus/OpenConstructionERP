"""Three tax tables, hand-maintained, that can silently disagree.

The platform carries VAT rates in three unrelated places:

* ``app/core/tax.py`` - a Python dict, 22 countries, read by the country packs.
* ``app/modules/property_dev/data/tax_rates.yaml`` - 12 jurisdictions, and the
  one that actually feeds the property development tax quote panel.
* ``app/modules/i18n_foundation/seed_data/tax_configurations.json`` - 40
  countries, effective-dated, and the only one with any history.

``core/tax.py`` says so in its own docstring: "Nothing currently checks that
the two agree ... so the two can drift apart silently. Treat that as a known
gap, not as a guarantee." This is that check. It does not unify them - which
is the source of truth is a design decision nobody has taken - it only makes a
disagreement impossible to ship without somebody seeing it.

Two things this deliberately does NOT do.

It does not convict on absence. Most countries appear in one table and not
another, by design: the yaml carries stamp duty for jurisdictions with no VAT
block at all, and ``core/tax.py`` leaves out Brazil and the United States on
purpose. A gate that fired on absence would be red from birth, and a gate that
is always red teaches everyone to ignore it.

It does not compare sub-national rates. The other two tables are keyed by
country and cannot express a province, so only rows marked ``national`` are
comparable at all. Canada's federal GST is not "Canada's VAT rate" in the
sense the other tables mean, and comparing them would be a category error.
