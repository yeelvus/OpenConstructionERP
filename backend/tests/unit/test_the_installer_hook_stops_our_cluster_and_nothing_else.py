"""The Windows installer hook must stop our database, and only ours.

The hook is a PowerShell one-liner embedded in an NSIS macro. Nothing compiles
it, nothing type-checks it, and a mistake inside it does not fail a build: it
becomes a silent no-op on a user's machine, which is exactly how the previous
version of this hook spent five releases matching zero of the processes it was
written to match. So the file that ships is read here directly, and the parts
that carry the meaning are asserted one by one.

There are two ways for this hook to be wrong and they pull in opposite
directions. Stopping too little leaves the embedded postmaster running after the
app is gone, holding the data directory and the port, which is the defect this
hook exists to fix. Stopping too much reaches into an unrelated PostgreSQL that
happens to share an image name, which is the older and worse defect the previous
hook had. A test that only checks one direction cannot tell a working guard from
a guard that refuses everything, so on Windows both directions are executed
against real processes.

The data directory the hook looks in has to be the one the backend actually
uses. That agreement is asserted against the backend's own source rather than
against a constant repeated here, because a constant repeated here is just a
second place to forget.
