# sqlite+aiosqlite default that the backend hard-rejects, which made a
# bare `docker run` crash-loop).

# containing "@": the user info splits at the first one, so "oe:pa@ss@postgres"
# is read as host "ss@postgres", which resolves nowhere. The container then
# dies naming a host nobody typed, while PostgreSQL stays healthy on the same
# password, because it gets it as a plain environment variable.
#
# Compose has no urlencode, so the parts are assembled and percent-encoded in
# app/config.py, where they are still separate and an encoder exists. That is
# also the only place that works for the backend-only image, which has no
# entrypoint script at all. Here we only have to stop insisting on a URL that
# is legitimately about to be built downstream.

# Catch the same damage in a DATABASE_URL that was handed to us already
# composed. Exactly one "@" separates userinfo from host; a second one means
# an unencoded "@" in the password, and the host is not what the operator
# thinks it is. Better to say so than to let asyncpg report a DNS failure for
# a host nobody typed.
#
# The way to ask that without getting it wrong is to take the same parse the
# reader downstream takes, rather than to invent a second one. User info ends
# at the FIRST "@", the host runs from there to the next "/", and a host is not
# allowed to contain "@", so an "@" still sitting in it is the damage itself.
#
# This used to truncate at the first "/" and then count "@" over what was left,
# which reads like it isolates the authority and does not, because a password
# may contain "/" and a base64 one does about four times in ten. Given the
# password "pa/b@ss" the truncated text was "oe:pa", the count was zero, and the
# guard waved through the very URL it exists to catch, the one make_url reads
# with host "ss@postgres". Isolating the host instead of counting over a guess
# at the authority also drops the false positives that counting had: an "@" in
# a database name or in a query string is past the first "/" and no longer in
# the text being examined.
