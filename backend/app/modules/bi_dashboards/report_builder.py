"""PDF / CSV / XLSX report builder for the BI Dashboards module.

A single :class:`ReportBuilder` covers all output formats so the service
layer treats them uniformly. Files are written to a per-tenant tmpdir
(falling back to ``tempfile.gettempdir()``) and the absolute path is
returned to the caller for download streaming.

Why server-local files (not S3): some installs run without object
storage. The ``/reports/{report_id}/download`` endpoint streams from
disk; tenants on S3 patch the storage layer through a hook (out of
scope for v1).
