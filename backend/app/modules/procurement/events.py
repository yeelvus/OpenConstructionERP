"""Procurement event handlers - auto-create PO from awarded tender / bid.

Subscribes to BOTH award events emitted by the two sister tendering
modules and creates a draft Purchase Order pre-populated from the winner:

* ``tendering.package.awarded`` (oe_tendering) - see
  :func:`_create_po_from_award`.
* ``bid_management.package.awarded`` (oe_bid_management) - see
  :func:`_create_po_from_bid_award`.

Both close the long-standing workflow gap where an award updated the BOQ
unit rates but left procurement empty, forcing the PM to retype the
supplier and every line item by hand.

Module is auto-imported by the module loader when ``oe_procurement`` is
loaded (see ``module_loader._load_module`` → ``events.py``).

Idempotency & reconciliation
----------------------------
Each generated PO carries deterministic keys in ``metadata``:

* tender awards write ``tender_package_id``;
* bid_management awards write ``bid_package_id`` AND, when the bid
  package is linked to a tendering package (``BidPackage.tender_id``),
  the same ``tender_package_id`` value the tender path would use.

Before creating a PO each handler scans existing project POs and
short-circuits if any of these keys already match. Because the two paths
share the ``tender_package_id`` key whenever a bid package is linked to a
tender, a project that runs BOTH modules for the same logical award never
ends up with two purchase orders - whichever fires first wins, the second
is an idempotent skip. Re-firing the same event (bus retry, manual
replay) is likewise a no-op.

Failure mode
------------
Errors are logged and swallowed - the award itself must never be blocked
because procurement wiring choked. The PO can always be created manually
from the UI.

    Published by ``qms/events.py::_on_ncr_raised_fanout`` whenever an NCR

    subcontractor), this marks that subcontractor ``under_review`` on its
    metadata - a non-destructive flag the scorecard UI surfaces and the next
    monthly rollup folds into the quality score via the NCR count. The flag
    records the triggering NCR id, severity and timestamp so the buyer can
    see *why* a vendor is under review without spelunking the event bus.

    The defect signal is also forwarded to the subcontractors module as
    ``subcontractors.defect.recorded`` so its event subscriber can accumulate
    the NCR count onto the current period's rating basis (the same low-latency
    path the monthly compute reads).

    When no ``supplier_id`` is present (today's qms payload links the NCR to
    an inspection but does not resolve the responsible sub) the hand-off is
    logged so it stays observable; nothing to flag without a vendor. The
    handler never raises - an NCR must never fail because the rating
