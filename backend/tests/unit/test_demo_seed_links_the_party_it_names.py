"""A seeded record must link to the firm it names, on every demo project.

The purchase orders used to fail this in two different ways, and only one of
them was visible. Sixteen orders linked to nothing and printed an empty vendor
cell, which a reader notices. Thirty-nine more named one company in the note
and pointed at another, which no reader can notice and no other test asks
about: the note was written in the generator from the template's tender firms,
the link was resolved in the writer from the seeded contacts, and those two
lists differ in order and in length on every hand-written pack. The trade
subcontracts had the same split between title and counterparty.

The fix makes one choice serve both, so this reads the objects the writer
builds and asserts they agree. It does not re-implement the choice: a test that
recomputes the vendor the same way the writer does would agree with itself
whatever either of them said.

There is a second reason to run the writer rather than inspect it. Every module
block in ``_seed_module_data`` is wrapped in ``try / except Exception`` so that
a module the deployment does not carry cannot break the rest of the seed. A
NameError in the block would land in the same handler, the block would silently
write nothing, and no test that does not install a project would go red. So the
presence of each block's key in the returned summary is asserted too.
