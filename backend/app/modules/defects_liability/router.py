"""Defects-liability API routes (mounted at ``/api/v1/defects-liability``).

Post-handover warranty and defects-liability-period governance: the per-project
register of warranty / DLP entries, the defect notices raised against each while
its period runs, and the derived register rollup and retention-release-readiness
view (which entries have finished their DLP clean and are clear for the final
retention money).

Every endpoint is scoped to a project in its path and gated twice, exactly like
the sibling modules: a ``RequirePermission`` dependency enforces the read/write
permission, and ``verify_project_access`` (which raises 404 on both "missing" and
"denied") is awaited as the first line of every handler so a stranger can never
read or mutate another project's defects-liability data. Any referenced
``warranty_id`` is additionally re-checked in the service layer against the same
project, so a defect can never be attached across projects.
