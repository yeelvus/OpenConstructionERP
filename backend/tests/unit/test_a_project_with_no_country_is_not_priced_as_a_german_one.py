"""A bill seeded for a project that names no country must not be a German bill.

``BOQService.apply_default_markups`` used to demand a region from its caller,
and the endpoint's default was the neutral international stack. From this
release the region is derived from the owning project's country when the
caller names none, so a Hungarian project gets Hungarian site overheads,
Hungarian profit and 27 percent afa without anybody picking a dropdown.

That derivation is only safe because ``Project.country_code`` became nullable
in revision ``v3319``. Before it the column was ``NOT NULL DEFAULT 'DE'`` while
the API accepted the field as optional, so "nobody chose a country" and
"somebody chose Germany" were the same stored row. Deriving a markup region
from that column in that state would have quoted every unstated market with
German overheads, German profit and German VAT, and nothing on the screen
would have said a country had been assumed. The wrong answer would have looked
exactly like a right one, which is why it needs a test rather than a comment.

So this file gates three things that are only correct together:

* the column can hold "unknown" at all,
* "unknown" resolves to the neutral stack and specifically not to DACH,
* and the service actually asks, rather than owning a correct helper it never
  calls.

Every check is on a pure function or on source, so the file needs no database.
