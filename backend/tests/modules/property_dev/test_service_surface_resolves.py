"""Every method the router calls on the service has to exist on the service.

``PropertyDevService`` is assembled twice over. Most methods are defined inside
the class; forty-one more are module-level ``_svc_*`` functions bolted on at
import time::

    PropertyDevService.get_broker = _svc_get_broker  # type: ignore[attr-defined]

That trailing ``type: ignore`` is the reason this module exists. It silences the
only checker that would otherwise notice a name which was never bolted on, and
it silences it at the definition site rather than at the call sites, so a route
calling a method nobody attached type-checks clean, imports clean, starts clean,
and raises ``AttributeError`` the first time a real request reaches that
endpoint. Nothing between the typo and the 500 except somebody exercising that
one route.

The check resolves bindings, not spellings
------------------------------------------
The obvious version of this - collect every ``svc.X(`` in the router and look
each ``X`` up on the class - was written first and reported five failures. All
five were false. ``cohort_retention``, ``time_to_close``,
``lead_source_attribution``, ``conversion_funnel`` and ``broker_performance``
are methods of ``AnalyticsService``, constructed locally inside the dashboard
routes under a variable that happens to also be called ``svc``. Two classes, one
variable name, and a check that could not tell them apart because it asked what
the receiver was *called* instead of what it was *bound to*.

So this walks each function, resolves every receiver it can - parameters by
their annotation, locals by their constructor - and attributes a call to
``PropertyDevService`` only when the binding says so. Receivers it can place on
some other type are counted separately and reported in the failure message
rather than dropped, because a classifier that silently discards what it cannot
categorise is reporting a denominator it does not have.

Static on purpose. Importing the module would answer the same question, but only
for the branches that import cleanly in the test environment, and it would make
a genuine missing attribute look like an import error.
