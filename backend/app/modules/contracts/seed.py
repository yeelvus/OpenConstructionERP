"""Deterministic seed data for the contracts module.

Four jobs, all idempotent:

1. **Catalog fabrication** - 10 contracts spanning all primary types
   (3 lump-sum, 2 GMP, 1 cost-plus, 2 T&M, 1 unit-price, 1 design-build),
   each with 5-15 SoV lines, 4 progress claims and 2 closed with a
   FinalAccount. Fabricated only into projects that hold no contract at
   all: the demo installer authors each demo project's own head contract
   and trade subcontracts, and stacking a generic catalog on top of those
   would bury the authored register under filler.

2. **Progress-claim backfill** - every authored contract shipped without a
   single progress claim, so the payment side of the register was empty on
   every install. For each live contract that has no claims yet, a staged
   claim run is written along the contract's own calendar: earlier periods
   paid, then one under approval, the latest submitted, the current period
   still a draft. German-market projects number their claims AZ-nn
   (Abschlagszahlung); everything else keeps PC-nnnn.

3. **Schedule-of-values backfill** - the catalog in job 1 writes SoV lines,
   but only into projects holding no contract at all, so on a real demo
   estate it never runs and every authored contract had an agreed value
   with nothing behind it. Each line-less contract gets a schedule shaped
   by how it is priced, summing to the contract value to the cent. The
   projects whose contracts are worded in German get theirs from a German
   catalogue of DIN 276 cost groups and Leistungsverzeichnis positions,
   chosen by the trade the contract's own title names.

4. **Claim breakdown** - each progress claim is apportioned across that
   schedule, filling each line up to its remaining room. Without it the
   G703 continuation sheet joins a priced schedule to nothing and the G702
   certificate face, a pure roll-up of those rows, reads zero earned on a
   contract the register says is part billed.

All decisions are seeded from fixed ``random.Random`` instances so output
is reproducible.
