"""Fail the build if a corrected foreign spelling reverts to its stripped form.

The demo packs ship German, Portuguese, Spanish and French text to users who
read those languages. Several packs were authored without the marks - umlauts
written out as vowel-plus-e ("Koecherfundamente", "Lueftungskanaele"), eszett as
ss ("Erschliessung", "Strasse"), Portuguese and Spanish accents deleted outright
("Instalacoes", "construccion"), French likewise ("Batiment", "securite"). To a
German or Brazilian reader that is visibly broken text on a marketing page.

Non-ASCII is allowed as data here and always was; see constraint 10 in
CLAUDE.md. The rule bans Russian prose in a comment, not accented characters in
a string, so "Köcherfundamente" and "Fundações" are simply the correct
spellings.

What this gate is
-----------------
A denylist of the exact spellings that were found broken in this repository,
recorded per file. It is deliberately not a rule about German or Portuguese
orthography, because such a rule cannot be written without false positives:
"Wasser", "muss" and "Anschluss" are correct with ss, "Bauer" and "Feuer"
contain a legitimate "ue", "aerodynamisch" a legitimate "ae", "agua" is correct
Spanish while "água" is correct Portuguese, and "nivel" is correct Spanish while
"nível" is correct Portuguese. Only a list can tell those apart, so this is a
list.

Consequently the gate catches a regression - a corrected word going back the way
it was - and does not catch a brand-new mangled word in a brand-new file. That
is the honest limit of it. A new pack needs a human to read it.

Only string literals are examined. The data is what ships; a comment or an
identifier is not.

Exit codes:
    0  every corrected spelling is still correct
    1  at least one reverted (with file:line and the spelling it should be)

Usage::

    python scripts/check_seed_diacritics.py            # every file in the denylist
    python scripts/check_seed_diacritics.py path/a.py  # only these (pre-commit)
