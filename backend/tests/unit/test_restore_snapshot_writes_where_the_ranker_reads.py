"""A snapshot restore creates the collection on the server it uploads to.

The restore handler used to take its Qdrant client from
``app.core.vector._get_qdrant``, which resolves on ``qdrant_url``, and then
push the snapshot bytes through the CWICR path, which resolves on
``cwicr_qdrant_url``. Wherever those two differ the operator was left with an
empty collection created on the general server, a ``vectors_count`` read back
from that empty collection, and a success message describing a restore the
ranker could not see. Fixed in e0ec5d179; nothing tested it, in either
direction.

What makes this defect awkward to test is that it is invisible to any single
server. Point one client at one recorder and every assertion passes both
before and after the fix, because the calls all land somewhere and the
somewhere is never compared. So these tests set the two stores to DISAGREE -
``QDRANT_URL`` at one host, ``CWICR_QDRANT_URL`` at another - and give each a
separately identifiable client. The question they ask is not "was a collection
created" but "created WHERE, and is that the same place the bytes went".

Both directions are asserted deliberately. A suite of only negative assertions
("the general store was not touched") passes just as happily when the handler
refuses everything and does nothing at all, which is how nineteen dead routes
once counted as healthy here. So the positive half - the collection really is
created on the CWICR server, the loader really is pointed at it, the count
really is read back from it - carries equal weight.

Hermetic by construction, and under ``_no_outbound_http`` without asking for
an exemption: the downloader is replaced by one that writes bytes to the cache
path, ``Path.home`` is redirected into ``tmp_path`` so the real home is never
touched, and the uploader is replaced by a recorder. Nothing here opens a
socket, so there is no transport for that fixture to reject.
