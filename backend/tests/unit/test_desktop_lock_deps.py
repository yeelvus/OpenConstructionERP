"""Guard: the desktop PyInstaller lock carries the right dependency set.

The desktop build installs dependencies from ``requirements-desktop.lock`` and
then runs ``pip install -e . --no-deps``, so anything missing from the lock is
simply absent from the frozen sidecar. A stale lock once shipped without PyMuPDF
/ OpenCV / laspy / lazrs / pypdf (PDF takeoff, raster room detection, point-cloud
reads, PDF stamping) and with pandas 3.x even though ``pyproject.toml`` caps it
below 3.0 - silently breaking those features on the desktop channel only, while
the wheel kept working. This test fails fast if the lock drifts away from the
declared base dependencies again.

The lock is compiled with one extra, ``[semantic-encoder]``, which pulls
``[semantic-clients]`` behind it. That replaced a narrower ``[semantic-clients]``
compile once the encoder download became default-on for desktop_mode. Under the
old lock the desktop build shipped a downloader with nothing that could load
what it downloaded: ``start_background_download`` asks
``semantic_library_available()`` first, that looks for a ``sentence_transformers``
spec, the frozen sidecar had none, and the advertised download quietly never
began. So the checks run in both directions - the client and the encoder that
the desktop build exists to carry must be present, and the CWICR bge-m3 stack,
which needs a separate ~700 MB model no desktop install ever fetches, must not
be.

The last test in this file compares two files rather than one. A name can be
pinned in the lock and excluded in ``desktop/pyinstaller.spec`` at the same
time, and when that happens the build installs a dependency and then throws it
away. That is not hypothetical: it is precisely what ``torch`` and ``scipy``
did, and it is invisible at build time because PyInstaller reports no error for
excluding something it was going to bundle.

It is a pure file-parsing test (no application import), so it runs anywhere the
test suite is collected.

# which is what makes it findable by anything that scans our imports. uharfbuzz
# is not, and that is precisely why it has to be named here by hand.
#
# reportlab imports uharfbuzz on our behalf, from a try/except at the top of

# consonant height on top of the vowel that is already there. That is a wrong
# glyph rather than a missing one, so it survives every check that only asks
# whether text rendered at all, and it reaches the user looking like text.
#
# The lock is the only place this can go missing. PyInstaller needs no help:
# 6.21.0 follows that try/except, collects the extension module unaided and
# shapes correctly, which was measured against a frozen artifact rather than
# assumed. The wheel and the Docker image both install from pyproject.toml and

    The two files are edited for different reasons months apart, and nothing
    else compares them. When ``[semantic-encoder]`` was added to the lock, torch
    and scipy were still in the spec's excludes, so the build would have
    downloaded 190 MB of encoder on Windows and then frozen a sidecar without
    it. PyInstaller says nothing about excluding a package it was going to
    bundle.

    That state was built and measured rather than argued about. A Windows
    sidecar frozen from this spec with torch and scipy put back in excludes
    still carries sentence_transformers, 167 modules of it, because PyInstaller
    reads the imports inside function bodies too. It carries no torch and no
    scipy at all, so the first import that runs for real fails, pulling torch,
    scipy and sklearn at module level.

    That build also claimed the feature it could not deliver. Until 58c2c9f7c
    ``doctor`` answered "Semantic search [semantic]: sentence-transformers
    installed" from a find_spec lookup, and a lookup is satisfied by what sits
    in the archive whether or not it can load. That check imports for real now
    and says so when the import fails, which removes the false claim but not
    the cost: it is a report from a build that has already been made, and on
    the desktop channel, shipped. This test reaches the same conclusion from
    two files at commit time.

    The comparison is by distribution name, which is the same as the import name
    for every name currently in either list. It would not catch a distribution
    whose import name differs from its package name (opencv-python-headless
    imports as cv2), so this is a floor rather than a proof.
