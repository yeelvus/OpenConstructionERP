"""A wave-5 subscriber that fails says so on the bus.

Every handler in ``_wave5_cross_module_subscribers`` used to wrap its whole
body in ``except Exception`` and report the failure at ``logger.debug``. The
bus already does better than that: ``EventBus.publish`` isolates each handler
in its own ``try``, logs the traceback at exception level, and records the
failure in ``EventResult.errors`` while the remaining handlers still run. The
inner catch therefore bought no isolation - it only discarded the record.

The consequence was not a crash but a silence. A subscriber that failed
produced a missing side effect and one debug line, and a caller holding the
``EventResult`` was told the publish had succeeded.

This test breaks a handler from the inside rather than standing in for it.
Replacing the handler with a stand-in that raises would pass identically
whether or not the catch is present, because the stand-in has no catch of its
own; the exception would reach the bus either way. So the real handler runs,
and the session it opens is what fails.
