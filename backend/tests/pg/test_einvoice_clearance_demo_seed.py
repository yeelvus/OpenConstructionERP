"""The clearance screen opens on a real trail, tied to the real invoice.

The module shipped complete and unseeded, so ``/einvoice-clearance`` was empty
on every install: no registration, no document, no history. What is pinned here
is that the seed closes that with records the module itself produced - a
registration the country registry answers for, a document whose payload is the
XRechnung the export route would render, and a trail written by the state
machine rather than described by the seeder.

The other half is what it must refuse. The showcase invoice is resolved by the
number the demo pack declares, never by position, so a project that carries
other receivables cannot capture the seed and a project that carries no showcase
invoice gets a log line and nothing written. A clearance document pointing at no
invoice is a fiscal record of nothing, which is worse than the empty screen.
