"""The commercial approval boundary of a variation - issue #435.

A variation request carries a headline estimate and may own a priced bill, and
the two are allowed to differ while the change is being priced. Nothing
recorded the boundary between them: which pricing state was put in front of
the approver, and what commercial amount that approver actually agreed to.

That gap is not visible in the way a missing field usually is. There is always
a number to hand - the headline - and it is a plausible figure of the right
order of magnitude, so a variation agreed at a negotiated 7,200 and one that
silently inherited a stale 12,000 produce records that look the same and flow
downstream identically. The point of these tests is that they no longer can.

Four claims:

* Submitting freezes WHICH pricing state was submitted, and freezing means
  frozen: the bill goes on being revised afterwards, which is the normal way a
  variation gets negotiated, and a total read later answers a different
  question from the one the record has to answer.
* Approving records what was agreed AND why it is that number. "The agreed
  value happens to equal the bill total" and "nobody ever really decided" must
  not be the same record.
* An amount that departs from the submitted pricing state has to say why. A
  difference is legitimate; a silent one is the defect.
* The agreed value flows into the Variation Order without being re-entered,
  and a request approved before any of this existed still promotes on the only
  figure it has.

Real PostgreSQL rather than a stubbed session, because every claim is about
what is stored and read back, and a stub would only restate the service's own
branching.
