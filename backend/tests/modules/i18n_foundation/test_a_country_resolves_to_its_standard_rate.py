"""A country with rate tiers resolves to the standard rate, not to their sum.

The bug this file convicts
--------------------------
``resolve`` used to add up every country-wide row in force. For a country with
one rate that is right by coincidence, and every fixture in this suite carried
one rate per country, so the whole suite passed. On the shipped seed file,
which is what a customer actually gets, it produced:

    Germany 26 (19 + 7), United Kingdom 25 (20 + 5 + 0),
    France 35.5 (20 + 10 + 5.5), Italy 32 (22 + 10), Poland 31 (23 + 8)

Rate tiers are alternatives - a supply is charged at one of them - so adding
them is not a rounding disagreement, it is a category error, and it reached
``GET /tax-configs/resolve/{country}``. It surfaced while adding Romania's
11 % reduced band, which would have turned a correct RO 21 into RO 32.

Why the figures are asserted as money and not as rates
------------------------------------------------------
A rate that round-trips through a field is not evidence anybody can price
with. Each case below multiplies a real net amount by the resolved rate and
asserts the tax and the gross, rounded the way the BOQ and invoice paths round
them - two decimals, HALF_UP.

Sources for the rates
---------------------
The non-Romanian figures are the standard rates the seed file already carried
and that this suite already relied on; nothing about them changes here, only
the arithmetic over them. Romania's 21 % standard and 11 % reduced band, both
from 1 August 2025, are cited on ``ROMANIA_VAT_SOURCES`` in
``app/modules/i18n_foundation/romania_vat.py``.
