"""No seeded row tells the reader it was seeded.

A demo estate is meant to read like a project someone is running. A row whose
title is "Demo Opportunity 0041" or whose note is "Seeded activity body" says
the opposite, and it says it on the screens we put in front of evaluators.

Why this is a source scan rather than a database assertion. The companion PG
test (``tests/pg/test_demo_seed_text_is_product_grade.py``) executes twelve
module seeders and reads the rows back, which is the stronger check, but the
seed writers are far more numerous than that: this file discovers every
``app/modules/*/seed.py``, ``app/core/demo_*.py`` and
``app/scripts/seed_demo_*.py``, and most of them are not executed by any test
at all. Scanning them is the only coverage they have.

WHAT THIS CHECK CANNOT SEE. Worth stating plainly, because a scanner's silence
is easy to mistake for a clean result:

* It reads literal text only. A name assembled at runtime - ``" ".join(parts)``,
  ``template.format(word)`` or ``prefix + suffix`` where either side is a
  variable - is invisible here. The f-string case IS covered (see
  ``_literal_text``) and is proven by
  :func:`test_the_scanner_can_see_inside_an_f_string`, because that was the
  shape the original leak took.
* Rule one only reaches values tagged by a field name, as ``title=...`` or
  ``{"title": ...}``. Data carried positionally, such as a tuple of
  ``(code, label, unit)`` unpacked later, is not tagged and is not seen. Rule
  two exists precisely because that blind spot is real: ``catalog/seed.py``
  held thirty-three user-visible codes in positional tuples.
* Rule one reads Python only. Rule two also reads the JSON seed payloads,
  because scanning Python alone was not enough: fifty-three of the catalogue
  codes lived in ``app/scripts/starter_seed_data.json``, from where
  ``seed_starter.py`` copies them verbatim into ``CostItem.components`` and the
  BOQ resource editor prints them in its Code field. A source scan that stops at
  the file extension the defect was first found in will keep reporting clean.
* It says nothing about whether a value is *correct*, only whether it admits to
  being scaffolding.

DELIBERATELY NOT FLAGGED. Six classes carry these words on purpose. They are
listed so the next person does not read them as misses and start "fixing" them:

1. the demo user's login credential, which has to stay typeable and published;
2. ``/api/demo/*`` route paths and storage prefixes, which are API surface;
3. log, print and exception strings, which are read by operators, not users -
   excluded structurally by :func:`_logging_argument_nodes`;
4. legacy ``DEMO-`` prefixes kept so a re-seed can recognise rows an older
   seeder wrote, whether to delete them or, in ``catalog/seed.py``, to rename
   them forward. Excluded by the shape of :data:`_DEMO_CODE`, which requires a
   character after the separator and so never matches a bare prefix constant;
5. the input to a ``uuid5`` derivation, where the text is an id ingredient and
   never displayed;
6. ``Document.file_path``, whose row marks itself demo through
   ``metadata_={"is_demo": True}`` rather than through the displayed string.

# Words that admit the row came from a seeder rather than from a project.
#
# "sample" is not one of them on its own, and treating it as one made this test
# reject the product's own vocabulary. In construction English a sample is a
# thing you take and test: a water sample sent for potability, a concrete cube,
# a sample room built for the client to approve. The seed tree writes it in
# that sense sixty-odd times, and the only reason this rule stayed green for so
# long is that most of those are ``rng.sample`` calls the AST walk never reads.
# The one that finally fired, "sample taken for potability", admits nothing.
#
# So the word is matched by sense rather than by spelling. It counts as
# scaffolding only where it modifies a noun naming an artefact a seeder
# produces, or where the sentence says outright that the row is an example.
# "sample data" and "sample record" still fail. "sample taken", "sample room",
# "sample with the laboratory" do not, because in each of those the word is the
# head noun of a real thing on a real site.
#
# The same collision exists for "demo", which is how this trade abbreviates
# demolition - ``bid_management/seed.py`` already carries a "DEMO" bid for a
# demolition phase. Nothing trips on it today because that value is a bare
# code rather than prose, so it is left alone rather than pre-emptively
# loosened; if a demolition description ever fails here, this is the reason.

# Rule two. A code opening with DEMO- is user-visible wherever it sits: the
# estimator reads it off the card. Position-independent on purpose, because the
# field-name rule below cannot see values held in positional tuples.
#
# Case-sensitive, and that is the whole point of the rule. Upper case is what
# separates a code from an identifier: ``DEMO-LAB-001`` is printed on a
# catalogue card, while ``demo_id``, ``demo-seed`` and ``demo_asset_seed`` are
# variable names, dict keys and filenames that no user ever sees. Matching case
# insensitively flagged sixty of those and would have made the rule useless.
#
# The trailing character class is what separates a code from a prefix. A code
# continues into its own body, ``DEMO-LAB-001``. A legacy match pattern does
# not: ``f"DEMO-{project_key}-"`` contributes the literal text ``DEMO--``, and
# those are the read-only prefixes of class 4, which exist so a re-seed can
# find and delete rows an older seeder wrote. Excluding them by shape rather
# than by an allowlist entry means there is no list here to rot.
