"""The demo EIR matrix shows a project, not a failed one.

Two defects, both found by looking at a screenshot rather than by walking the
tree, and both invisible to every gate because the data was well formed and
merely wrong to read.

The matrix painted every cell red and scored nought per cent on every row. It
was not a rendering fault: the matrix is reconstructed from deliverable rows and
scores coverage as accepted over the rows that exist, and the demo seeded a
requirement set with no deliverables at all. Zero rows is zero coverage, so the
screen told the truth about data that should never have shipped.

The requirement names were slugs. ``entity`` was minted by lowercasing a trade
item and punching out its spaces, which put ``blinding_concrete,__15_mpa`` on
screen where "Blinding concrete, 15 MPa" belongs. Nothing depended on the slug
form: ``entity`` is matched against a model's ``element_type`` and a bill's
trade item never matched one in either spelling.

These assertions are about generated data only, so they run in the unit lane and
need no database.
