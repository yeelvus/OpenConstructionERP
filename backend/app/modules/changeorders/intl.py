"""International, review-ready helpers for change orders.

These are pure functions with no database, network, or global state. They give
the change order module a small, well-documented vocabulary for the money and
status questions that come up on every construction project worldwide:

* what a change order is worth once its line items are priced and any markup /
  overhead-and-profit (OH&P) percentage is applied;
* how the priced change orders on a project group by their approval state;
* what those approved change orders do to the revised contract sum.

Design rules that keep the module correct for any country:

* Money is always ``Decimal``, never ``float``. Values round to 2 decimal
  places (HALF_UP) only at the presentation boundary, matching the rest of the
  module.
* No currency, tax rate, unit, or locale is hardcoded. Currency is carried
  alongside every amount and is never blended across different ISO codes: two
  amounts in different currencies are never summed without an explicit rate,
  which is out of scope for these helpers and raises a clean ``ValueError``.
* Every markup / OH&P / admin percentage is an explicit parameter with a
  documented default of zero, so a caller that says nothing gets the raw priced
  value and no silent uplift.
* Bad input surfaces as ``ValueError`` (a clean 400 for the API), never as a
  500, ``NaN``, or ``inf``. Division by zero, empty inputs, and mixed statuses
  are all handled with defined results.
* Outputs expose their components (net lines, markup, totals) so a reviewer or
  auditor can reconstruct every figure by hand.
