"""The government-platform boundary.

Core does not talk to a tax authority. Every platform in the registry has its
own transport, its own certificate handling and its own SOAP or REST dialect,
and shipping eight of those would put eight client stacks and their transitive
dependencies inside a core that has to run on a 3 GB server. So the boundary is an
interface: this module owns the state, the validation and the trail, and an
adapter owns the wire.

An adapter is asked one of two questions and answers with a
:class:`SubmissionOutcome`. It never touches the database, never decides what
status a document lands in - the regime decides that - and never sees an ORM
object. It is handed plain data and returns plain data, which is what makes the
whole state machine testable without a network.

Shipped adapters
================
One: :class:`ReferenceAdapter`, offline and deterministic. It exists so the
round trip is exercisable end to end - submit, clear, cancel, reject - and so a
deployment can see the module work before anybody has bought a provider
account. It refuses to serve a live profile, which is the one property that
matters about it: an offline adapter that could mint an identifier for a
production invoice would be a way to produce fiscal records that no authority
has ever seen.

Real adapters register themselves the same way, from their own package's
``on_startup``. Nothing in this file needs to change to add one.
