"""v2.9.24 — Normalize legacy ``estimator`` role to ``editor``.

The 2.8.x demo seeder shipped Sarah Chen with ``role="estimator"`` while the
public ``/auth/register`` and admin ``/users/{id}`` update endpoints have
always restricted ``role`` to ``admin|manager|editor|viewer``. The frontend
``UserRole`` type and role-config map likewise don't know about
``estimator``, so the seeded row rendered with the fallback (Viewer) and
could not be edited via the UI without first re-typing the role through a
direct DB write.

This migration brings any pre-existing ``estimator`` rows into the canonical
4-role set. The seeder itself was updated to write ``editor`` directly, so
fresh installs after v2.9.24 won't need this migration — but production
boxes that booted with the older seeder do.
