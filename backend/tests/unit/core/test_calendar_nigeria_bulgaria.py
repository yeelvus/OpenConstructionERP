"""Nigeria and Bulgaria join the calendar engine as covered jurisdictions.

Written before _holidays_ng and _holidays_bg exist, per the fleet rule that
the standing test lands before the change it stands for. Every assertion
below is expected to fail until both functions and their _WORKING_WEEK
entries are added to app/core/calendar.py, and each failure is the right one:
neither country is in _HOLIDAY_FUNCS yet, so a statutory date such as
Nigerian Independence Day currently resolves as an ordinary Thursday rather
than a holiday.

What each test is checking, and why it is not a data dump:

- A known statutory date is a non-working day. Chosen to be a date that needs
  no substitution logic to land on a weekday on its own, so the assertion is
  about the date being present at all, not about a substitution rule working.
- An ordinary weekday with nothing on it is still a working day. Without this,
  a bug that marked every day non-working would pass the first assertion too.
- The control that matters: a jurisdiction this module deliberately does not
  cover reports itself as such through resolve_holidays provenance, rather
  than silently answering like an ordinary working week. Kenya is used here
  as a real ISO code with no entry in _HOLIDAY_FUNCS, chosen only because
  nobody in the current cohort is working on it, the same reasoning
  test_calendar_provenance.py uses "XX" for, spelled with a country that will
  not quietly start passing because an unrelated commit by someone else
  covers it.

The Bulgaria substitution test exists because Bulgaria is not just a longer
date list than Nigeria. Labour Code Art. 154(2) moves a holiday that falls on
a Saturday or Sunday onto the following working day, or, when a Saturday
holiday and a Sunday holiday are adjacent, onto the following two working
days, with the Easter block explicitly exempted. A flat set of dates gets
this wrong twice over: it misses the substitute days entirely, and if the
exemption were missed instead, Holy Saturday and Easter Sunday would
manufacture two substitute days after every single Easter, because those two
are on a weekend every year by construction. 2022 is used because 24 December
that year is a Saturday, so Christmas Eve, Christmas Day and the Second Day
of Christmas (24-26 December) run Saturday, Sunday, Monday, and the two
substitute days chain onto 27 and 28 December rather than colliding with a
holiday already there.

What is deliberately not asserted: the exact Nigerian Minister-declared Eid
and Mawlid dates, because those are policy announcements the calendar engine
approximates from the Islamic calendar the same way it does for the Gulf
countries, not statutory Gregorian dates a test can pin down in advance. Also
not asserted: the Nigerian working week as a legal certainty, because the
Labour Act does not fix one economy-wide - see the sourcing note carried in
_holidays_ng and the _WORKING_WEEK comment once they land.
