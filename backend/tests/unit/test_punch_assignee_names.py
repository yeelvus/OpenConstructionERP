"""A punch item names its owner rather than quoting an id at the reader.

``assigned_to`` and ``verified_by`` are free-text columns, and a typed-in name,
a contact id and a user id are all legitimate contents. The seeder writes a
contact id and the assignment control on the screen writes a user id, and every
screen printed whichever it got, so a row read "Assigned To 3f2b8c1e-9a44-..."
and the avatar beside it took its initial from a hex digit.

What is pinned here:

* an id resolves to the name its register holds - contacts and platform users
  both, since the column receives both - keyed by the value as it is stored, so
  the caller can look it up without re-normalising;
* text that is not an id is never queried, because a typed-in name is already
  the answer;
* a whole page costs two lookups whatever its length, which is why this lives
  in the router rather than on the page: the punch list is the slowest screen
  in the module and a per-row request would be felt;
* contacts is an optional module and a row can be deleted, so a failed or empty
  lookup returns nothing rather than raising or inventing a name, and each runs
  inside a savepoint so it cannot abort the caller's transaction.
