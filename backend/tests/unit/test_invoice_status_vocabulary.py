"""An invoice status must exist in the lifecycle and be sayable on screen.

Two failures met on the same row of the same table, and neither is visible from
one side alone.

The seed wrote ``submitted`` on receivable invoices. The finance FSM has no such
state, so the invoice could not be moved anywhere afterwards, and the schema does
not police the field (``status: str = Field(default="draft", max_length=50)``),
so nothing refused it on the way in. The wide seed-vocabulary scan cannot see
this one either: it reads vocabularies out of Pydantic patterns, and this field
has none, which is exactly why the value survived to the screen.

The other direction is ``sent``, a state the FSM has always had and the UI never
learned. It had no label key, so the badge printed the database word; no colour,
so an invoice the client is holding looked like an unsent draft; and no filter
entry, so it could not be found except by clearing the filter.

Both are the same defect seen from opposite ends, so both are asserted here as
one contract: the lifecycle is the vocabulary, the seed may only speak it, and
every word in it has a label, a colour and a filter entry. Read out of the
sources rather than restated, so a state added to the FSM tomorrow fails this
until the screen can say it.
