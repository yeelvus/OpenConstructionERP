"""Every module that owns a defect register is either in the Issue Hub or named here.

The Unified Issue Hub merges five registers into one list so that, in the words
of its own subtitle, nothing falls between the cracks. The union it reads is
declared once, in ``frontend/src/features/issues/issueSources.ts``, as the
``IssueSource`` type. Nothing checked that union against the platform.

Measured, the platform holds defect registers in more modules than the hub
reads. A module that starts holding defects is invisible to the hub, and the
only symptom is a screen that quietly shows a subset while being named for the
whole: a user filtering the hub to "all sources" still misses whole registers,
and there is no log line or failing assertion anywhere to say so.

This gate censuses the backend for issue-like models, maps the hub's sources
onto their owning modules, and requires every censused module to be either
covered or named in ``KNOWN_ABSENT_FROM_HUB`` with the reason. It fails in
both directions: a new defect register with no hub source and no allowlist
line fails, and an allowlist line that outlives its gap fails too.

The census is name-based and says so. It finds a module whose model or table
carries one of ``_ISSUE_WORDS``; a register called ``Deficiency`` would slip
past it. The word list is the declared limit of the instrument, not a claim
that the platform holds nothing else. Widening the list is the way to widen
the gate - writing a second gate beside it is not.

The word list also produces one false positive on purpose, and it is kept
rather than tuned away: ``hse_advanced.PPEIssue`` is an issuance of protective
equipment, not a defect. Narrowing the words until it disappears would take
real registers with it, so it is allowlisted with that reason, which is also
what stops a future reader from "fixing" the gap by wiring PPE into the hub.
