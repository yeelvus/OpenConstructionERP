"""The third repair nature, and the checker that makes it mean something.

``never_delivered`` says a repair only ever adds rows. That claim is worth
having only if a repair which breaks it fails, so the controls here are repairs
that break it in the two ways that matter: one edits a row it found, and one
adds a second copy of a row already on file. The second is the realistic
failure. An additive repair does not usually damage anything - it duplicates,
and the reader that expected one tax rate for a province now gets two.
