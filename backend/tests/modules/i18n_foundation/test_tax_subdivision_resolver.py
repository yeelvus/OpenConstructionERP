"""Resolving a Canadian tax rate: does asking for a province get that province?

The platform could always *store* a per-province rate. What it could not do was
*select* one. The province lived inside ``tax_code`` as a naming convention -
``HST_ON``, ``PST_BC`` - that no query could filter on and that only a helper in
one test file ever parsed, so asking for Canada's tax configuration handed back
thirteen undifferentiated rows and left the caller to do the arithmetic. The
obvious arithmetic, federal plus whatever my province charges, is right in
British Columbia and reports an 18 % Ontario invoice.

These tests run against real rows through the service, which is the half a
seed-file test cannot cover: the seed data being right proves nothing about a
resolver that never reads the province. The companion file
``test_i18n_foundation_tax_combination.py`` covers the other half, the shipped
data, using this same resolver.

**The control that matters most is Alberta.** Alberta levies no provincial
sales tax, so the correct answer there is the federal 5 % - and 5 % is also what
a resolver returns for a province it has never heard of, or for a project where
nobody recorded a province at all. Those three must not be one answer. Alberta
is a rate a quantity surveyor can put in a tender; the other two are questions
nobody answered, and this module returns no rate for them. If that distinction
ever collapses, ``test_alberta_and_an_unknown_province_do_not_answer_alike``
is what convicts it.

Rates and their sources, all read from a government publication in August 2026:

* federal GST 5 %, Excise Tax Act s.165(1)
* Ontario 13, New Brunswick 15, Newfoundland and Labrador 15, Prince Edward
  Island 15 - SOR/2016-119 and SOR/2016-212
* Nova Scotia 14 from 2025-04-01, 15 before it - SOR/2025-77, which cut the
  provincial component from 10 % to 9 %
* British Columbia PST 7 %, Saskatchewan PST 6 %, Manitoba RST 7 %, all on the
  pre-GST amount - the three provincial finance ministries
* Quebec QST 9.975 % on the pre-GST amount since 2013-01-01, and 9.5 % on the
  GST-included amount before it - Ministere des Finances du Quebec information
  bulletin 2012-4
