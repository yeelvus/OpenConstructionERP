"""Integration tests for per-folder permissions (Issue #FP).

Covers the eight scenarios in the spec:

    1. Owner grants ``viewer`` to a member → member can list+get,
       but POST upload and DELETE both return 404 / 403.
    2. Owner grants ``editor`` to a member → member can upload AND
       delete their OWN uploads.
    3. Owner revokes the grant → member is back to 404 on the
       restricted folder.
    4. Non-owner cannot grant → 403 from
       ``_verify_project_owner``.
    5. Duplicate grant on the same ``(project, kind, path, user)``
       → 409 from the unique constraint.
    6. Unscoped folder (no grants) stays visible to every project
       member by default.
    7. Cross-project IDOR: a user with a grant on project A cannot
       list project B.
    8. Editor cannot delete OTHER members' uploads (defence in depth).
