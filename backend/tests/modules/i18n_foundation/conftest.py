"""Shared fixtures for the i18n Foundation test suite.

The session fixture runs against the shared PostgreSQL unit database from
``tests/_pg.py``, inside an outer transaction that is rolled back on teardown.

Foreign keys stay ON (no ``disable_fks``) simply because this module has none:
its four tables - exchange rates, countries, work calendars, tax configs - are
flat reference data with no cross-module columns, so nothing here needs the
replication role.

There are no validation rules to register: the module ships no ``validators.py``
at all, which the suite records as a finding rather than papering over.

Money is written and asserted as strings throughout. Every amount, rate and
percentage the module stores is a ``String`` column holding a decimal literal,
so a test that compares floats would be testing something the module never
does. Assertions are on the exact string.

    one without the other gets an IntegrityError rather than a row that
    resolves to the wrong province.

    **Know what ``is_default=True`` is hiding before you add a case.** The
    resolver answers a country-wide question by taking the row flagged
    ``is_default``, and refuses with ``default_rate_ambiguous`` when the rows
    in force do not name exactly one. This default puts every fixture that does
    not say otherwise into the single unambiguous case - so a test built on it
    cannot tell "picks the right rate" apart from "there was only ever one
    candidate". That is not hypothetical: it is how a repair that could strip a
    country of its rate entirely passed its own tests, and it is the same
    blindness as the one-rate-per-country fixtures that let the resolver sum
    tiers for five markets undetected. Both are written up in
    ``internal design note VAT_RESOLVER_SUMMED_TIERS_2026-08-26``.

    If your case is about *selection* - which rate wins, or whether one wins at

    resolver more than one row to choose between.
