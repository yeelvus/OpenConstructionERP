"""Every entrance to the CPM work calendar refuses the same overrides.

The engine has more than one way in. A calendar reaches it through a
schedule's ``metadata`` and through the CPM endpoint's request body, and the
two do not share a schema. Guarding one and not the other is the defect these
tests exist to prevent, so they are parametrized over the doors rather than
written twice: a third entrance joins by adding a row to ``DOORS``, and every
case in this file then applies to it.

The refusals carry their own negative control. ``_PreChangeCPMCalculateRequest``
is the request model exactly as it stood before the guard was added, and every
value the request-body door now refuses is asserted to have been accepted by
it. Without that, a suite that passed for both doors while only one was
guarded would look identical to this one.
