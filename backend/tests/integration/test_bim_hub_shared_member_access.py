"""BIM Hub shared-member read access regression (issue #271).

Pins the access policy for opening a BIM model in the viewer: a non-admin
user the project has been SHARED with (added via ``add_project_member``)
must be able to fetch the model through ``GET /api/v1/bim-hub/{model_id}`` -
the endpoint the viewer calls to load a model by id.

The reported defect: a shared non-admin project member could SEE a BIM file
in the project's documents list, but opening it in the viewer returned
"model not found"; granting that member admin made the same model open. The
cause was the BIM router's local ``_verify_project_access`` checking only
owner-or-admin, while the documents / BOQ / schedule read paths authorize
via the central ``verify_project_access`` (owner OR admin OR team-member).
The fix aligns the BIM helper with that central rule, so this suite proves:

* B (shared, non-admin VIEWER) CAN open the model        -> 200
* C (no relationship to the project) CANNOT              -> 404 (IDOR-safe)
* A (owner / admin) still CAN                            -> 200

Scaffolding mirrors ``test_bim_hub_idor.py`` (boot the app once, register /
activate / login real users over HTTP) and the sharing flow in
``test_team_member_project_access.py`` (``POST /projects/{id}/members/``).
The BIM model row is seeded directly via the DB because a real upload needs
the CAD converter; access control does not depend on how the row was created.
