"""The heal drops a NOT NULL it cannot honour, and now it says so.

``postgres_auto_migrate`` enforces NOT NULL on a column it is adding only when
a default exists to backfill the rows already in the table. Without one it adds
the column nullable, which is the right call - the alternative fails outright
on a populated table - but it leaves the models and the database disagreeing
about that column for the life of the install, because no revision body ever
runs to tighten it later.

Until the line under test existed, that divergence was created in total
silence. The column went in, the heal counted it as a success, and no log line,
no health field and no gate recorded that the NOT NULL had been dropped on the
way. The nearby warning in the same function is a different case: it fires when
the database *refuses* a DEFAULT, not when the models never offered one.

What is pinned here is the announcement and its aim. A warning that named every
added column, or fired on a column the models made optional, would satisfy a
test for "a warning appeared" and be useless in a boot log, so both controls
have to come out the other way.

Note the limit, which is deliberate and is why this is only half the signal:
the line fires on the boot that adds the column, not on the boots afterwards.
An install that upgraded months ago has the divergence and logs nothing about
it now. Answering "does this database match the models today" is a standing
question about the schema and needs a standing signal, not this log.
