"""supplier_catalogs: a tolerance profile's absolute floor names its currency.

A profile carries two price bands and the wider one wins: a percentage of the
order total, and an absolute floor. The percentage is safe in any currency,
because a percentage of the order is already denominated in the order's own
currency. The floor was a bare number, and a profile is selected by name and
applied to purchase orders in whatever the tenant trades in.

The direction of the failure is the reason this matters
-------------------------------------------------------
A floor that is too small for the order's currency never wins the ``max`` and
changes nothing. A floor that is too large widens the band, so the invoice is
auto-matched and approved for payment with no exception and no message. The
expensive failure is the silent one, which is why the tests below assert on
``auto_matched`` rather than only on the reported numbers.

This is not the currency guard that already exists
--------------------------------------------------
``match_invoice`` already refuses when the invoice and the order disagree on
currency. That compares two documents. An order and its invoice can agree
perfectly and still be measured against a floor written in a third currency,
which that guard never looks at, and every test here keeps invoice and order
in step so the existing guard stays out of the way.

What ships today
----------------
Nothing sets a nonzero floor: no migration inserts a profile row,
``ensure_default_tolerance_profile`` is called by no application code, and its
floor would be zero anyway. So this defect is reachable only by configuration,
through ``POST /tolerance-profiles``. That is why the zero-floor case is
tested as a no-op - it is what every existing installation does - and why the
unlabelled rows here are built through the repository rather than the schema,
which now refuses to create one.
