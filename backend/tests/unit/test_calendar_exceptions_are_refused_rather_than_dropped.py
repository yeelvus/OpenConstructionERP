"""A holiday the engine cannot read is refused at the write, not dropped later.

``cpm._parse_exceptions`` used to swallow an unreadable exception date with a
bare ``except ValueError: pass``. The day was then scheduled as a working day,
and nothing downstream could tell it from a day nobody had marked. A user could
mark a holiday, have the request accepted, and watch the system work the day.

These tests pin the three parts of the answer:

* the engine still computes when it meets an unreadable entry, because its
  day-stepping loops have to terminate, but it now names the value it dropped,
* the write schema refuses the entry outright, beside the ``work_days`` check
  that already refuses its sibling field,
* the refusal is narrow. An unambiguous but untidy entry is normalised and
  accepted rather than rejected, because a date pasted from a spreadsheet
  carries a trailing space and an export writes an ISO datetime.

The control is the first test and it is load-bearing: a suite in which every
case raises looks identical to a suite in which every case is correctly refused,
so one valid holiday has to be shown moving a real finish date first.
