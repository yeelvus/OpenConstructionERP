"""Executes ``v3293_bi_dashboards_project_scope`` against real PostgreSQL.

Reading a migration proves nothing about it, and this one carries a claim that
only a populated database can settle: adding the project dimension must leave
the rows that were already there readable, and leave them company-wide rather
than orphaning them into a project nobody named.

Three claims are checked here:

* ``upgrade()`` is a no-op against a database that already carries the columns.
  That is the ordinary case, because a fresh install materialises the schema
  with ``create_all`` and then stamps; the first thing this revision meets in
  production is a database that does not need it. It also pins that the index
  name the revision writes is the name ``create_all`` writes, which is the
  quiet way two install routes drift apart.
* Down then up restores the columns and their indexes, and neither direction
  trips over a second run.
* Rows written before the column existed survive the upgrade and come out with
  ``project_id`` NULL, which is what "company-wide" is stored as.

The revision is driven through an Alembic ``MigrationContext`` rather than
``alembic upgrade head`` so that what is under test is this revision's own SQL
and not the state of the 300-odd revisions around it. Whether it is reachable
is ``tests/unit/test_alembic_single_head.py``'s job.

Everything runs against a throwaway database from ``isolated_engine()``, cloned
per test and dropped afterwards. The shared unit database is off limits:
dropping columns in it would take down every other test in the session.

Run:
    cd backend
    python -m pytest tests/modules/bi_dashboards/test_bi_dashboards_project_scope_migration.py -v
