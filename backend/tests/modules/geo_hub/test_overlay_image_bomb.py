"""An image header declaring an implausible surface answers 413, not a bare 500.

Pillow reads the declared width and height off the header and refuses to open
anything far above ``Image.MAX_IMAGE_PIXELS``, so a few dozen bytes are enough
to trigger it. The exception it raises is not a ``ValueError``, which is the
only failure the overlay upload used to handle, so it travelled past every
handler between the rasteriser and the client and surfaced as an unexplained
500 on a request the server had in fact understood and deliberately refused.
