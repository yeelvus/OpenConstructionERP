"""End-to-end proof that the three new rule sets actually run on a write.

The per-module rule tests next to this file drive ``validation_engine`` directly
and prove the rules are correct and reachable. They cannot prove the services
call them, because every service hook deliberately swallows its own exceptions:
a broken payload builder would produce no findings, log nothing, and leave every
one of those tests green. That is the same failure mode as a rule registered
into a rule set nobody passes - reachable on paper, dormant in practice.

So each test here drives the real service method on a deliberately incomplete
record and asserts the finding reached the caller's observation point:

* ``subcontractors`` - ``update_agreement`` into ``active`` -> ``logger.warning``;
* ``rfq_bidding``    - ``issue_rfq`` -> ``logger.warning``;
* ``submittals``     - ``submit_submittal`` -> the structured state-change line.

If a model attribute is renamed out from under a payload builder these fail;
without them the rename is silent.

The last test in the file covers the other half of the same problem: a rule id
that no longer matches its message key. ``translate`` answers a miss with a
humanised version of the key rather than an error, so a rename degrades the
message silently in every locale at once.
