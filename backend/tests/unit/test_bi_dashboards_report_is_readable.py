"""A report a person opens should read like a document - issue #441.

``run_report`` flattens each KPI's breakdown into ``breakdown__<key>``
columns and hands the rows straight to the renderer, so the PDF printed
``breakdown__ac_by_currency`` as a heading and
``{'EUR': Decimal('100000.00')}`` as a cell. Both are Python, in a
document sent to a client.

The row keys themselves are left alone: ``ReportRunResponse.rows`` is the
JSON the API returns and something machine-side matches on those keys.
Only the printed heading changes.

These tests read the PDF, which is one of three writers, and that is the
reason the XLSX and CSV shipped the defect for a further commit. What
every format has to say is asserted in
``test_bi_dashboards_every_writer_is_readable.py``; this file stays on
the PDF because the PDF is the one whose page geometry is at stake.

The reported third symptom, wide tables losing their right hand columns,
was already fixed - ``build_pdf_report`` computes column widths through
``pdf_table_column_widths``. That behaviour has its own tests in
``test_pdf_exports_stay_on_the_page.py`` and is not re-asserted here,
beyond one check that these changes did not undo it.

Run:
    cd backend
    python -m pytest tests/unit/test_bi_dashboards_report_is_readable.py -v
