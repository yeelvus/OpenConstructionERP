"""Persisted "applied partner pack" state - survives restarts.

A single global record (single-tenant, per the partner-pack ADR). Stored as
JSON alongside the database, mirroring ``module_state.py``. This lets an admin
*apply* a pack from inside the app (the /modules Partner Packs tab) rather than
only via the ``OE_PARTNER_PACK`` env var, and lets the app reverse the apply.

Precedence used by ``discovery.get_active_pack``:
    in-app applied (this file) -> ``OE_PARTNER_PACK`` env -> none.
