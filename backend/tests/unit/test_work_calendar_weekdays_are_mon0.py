"""No shipped Monday-zero calendar may carry a weekday the CPM engine cannot count.

This is the mirror of ``tests/unit/test_work_calendar_weekdays_are_iso.py``.

The i18n ``WorkCalendar`` counts ISO weekdays, Monday = 1 through Sunday = 7, and
shipped a Saudi row written as ``[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`` under a zero-based convention.
``isoweekday()`` never returns 0, so that day was dropped and the country ran a
four-day week for as long as the row stood.

This platform's *other* work calendar counts the other way: ``date.weekday()``,
Monday = 0 through Sunday = 6. The same mistake in this direction is a 7. It is not
imagined - ``app/core/cpm.py`` records ``work_days=[7]`` as "a common Sunday = ISO 7
mistake" in the docstring of the very function that drops it. Dropping is deliberate:
it guarantees the engine's day-stepping loops terminate. But an emptied week then
falls back to Monday-Friday, so the schedule is computed against a week nobody asked
for and nothing raises. The tolerance stays; the refusal belongs at the writers.

What this file checks, and why each source is read the way it is:

* ``schedule.service.WORK_CALENDARS`` - 12 shipped regional presets, a module-level
  dict, so it is imported and surveyed directly.
* ``core.calendar._WORKING_WEEK`` - 18 shipped country weeks, likewise. **Read only.**
  That file belongs to another change in flight; this test imports it and never
  writes it.
* ``Calendar.work_days`` server default - what a row that omits the column gets, read
  off the column rather than off the source line.
* ``schedule_advanced/seed.py`` - the demo calendar is built straight on the ORM, so
  no schema sees it. It is the same bypass that let the Saudi row ship. Parsed
  narrowly: ``Calendar(...)`` keyword arguments in that one file, nothing wider. A
  repo-wide literal census was considered and rejected - most ``[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]``
  literals in these modules are defensive fallbacks inside coercion code, and
  flagging those would mean maintaining an allowlist of which literals count.

Fallback literals and Pydantic defaults are deliberately *not* surveyed. They are not
shipped calendar data; a wrong value there is a different bug with a different shape.
