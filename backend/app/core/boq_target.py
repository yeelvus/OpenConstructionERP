"""Deciding which bill of quantities a project-scoped operation acts on.

A bill of quantities is not unique per project. Nothing in the schema
constrains ``project_id`` to one row, the listing endpoint returns a page, and
markups hang off the bill, so two bills on one project are fully independent
records that hold different money. A module that needs "the project's BOQ" is
therefore asking a question that may have no answer, one answer, or several.

Several modules answered it the same wrong way: ``SELECT ... ORDER BY
created_at LIMIT 1``, the oldest bill wins, recorded at most in a log line.
On a project with a single bill that guess is always right, which is why it
survived. On a project with two it is a coin toss that writes real money into
a bill nobody named.

The rule, in one line: an explicit id decides; zero candidates refuses; one
candidate is the answer; several is a question, and a question is refused
rather than guessed.

Two decisions live in that rule and they belong to different people. The
ambiguity part is universal - nothing may guess between two bills. The
candidate *predicate* is the caller's, because "may I use this bill" depends
on what the caller is about to do:

* A caller that mutates the bill passes ``writable=True``, and only unlocked
  bills count. Writing into a locked, approved estimate is itself the defect.
* A caller that only reads the bill passes ``writable=False``, and every bill
  counts. Validating or scheduling from a locked, approved estimate is the
  normal case, not an error, and filtering it out would break every project
  whose only bill has been approved.

This module is deliberately free of module imports at import time: the BOQ
models are pulled in inside the functions, the way ``core.global_search`` and
``core.event_handlers`` already do it, so core does not hard-depend on a
plugin being installed.
