"""Run the shipped container entrypoint and check the DATABASE_URL guard.

`test_config_db_url_from_parts.py` says in a docstring that "the container
entrypoint refuses to start on this and names the reason". Nothing executed
that claim, and the guard it describes was wrong for four months: it truncated
the authority at the first "/" before counting "@", so a password holding both
characters slipped past the very check that exists to catch it.

The entrypoint is a shell script whose last act is `exec python -m uvicorn`,
so putting a stub `python` on PATH is enough to run the real file, guard and
all, without Docker and without a database. That is the point of this module:
the guard now has a reader that fails when it regresses.
