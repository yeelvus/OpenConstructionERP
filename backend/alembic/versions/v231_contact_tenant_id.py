"""v2.3.1 -- add tenant_id to oe_contacts_contact + backfill from created_by.

Context: the Contact module historically used ``created_by`` as an
IDOR fence (the router's ``_require_contact_access`` rejects any caller
whose user id does not match ``created_by``).  That works but leaves
two gaps:

1. Legacy rows with ``created_by IS NULL`` fall through the check and
   become 403 for everyone *including* the author — they were unreachable.
2. Semantics are conflated: ``created_by`` is an audit field ("who
   inserted this row") that should be immutable once written, but it
   was doubling as the tenant gate, so transferring a contact between
   users was indistinguishable from rewriting history.

This migration introduces a dedicated ``tenant_id`` column that carries
the access-gate semantics.  For single-tenant installs (the only shape
we ship today) it equals the creator's user id — contacts are siloed
per user, same effective behaviour as before.  A later migration can
link ``tenant_id`` to a real Tenants table without changing any call
sites.

Backfill: ``tenant_id = created_by`` for every existing row.  Rows with
``created_by IS NULL`` stay NULL — they remain admin-only, matching
current behaviour.

Idempotent — checks live schema and only adds the column / index / data
when missing.
