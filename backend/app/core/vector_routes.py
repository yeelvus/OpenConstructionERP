"""Factory for per-module ``/vector/status/`` and ``/vector/reindex/`` routes.

Every module that plugs into the cross-module semantic memory layer
(``app.core.vector_index``) needs the same two HTTP endpoints:

* ``GET  /vector/status/``   - collection health / row count
* ``POST /vector/reindex/``  - (re)embed rows from the database

The business logic never varies - only the adapter, the SQLAlchemy model,
the permission strings and (occasionally) a custom statement for modules
whose rows are scoped via a join through a parent table.  This factory
captures that boilerplate so module routers reduce to a single
``include_router(create_vector_routes(...))`` call.

Usage (simple direct project_id column)::

    from app.core.vector_routes import create_vector_routes
    from app.core.vector_index import COLLECTION_DOCUMENTS
    from app.modules.documents.vector_adapter import document_vector_adapter
    from app.modules.documents.models import Document

    router.include_router(
        create_vector_routes(
            collection=COLLECTION_DOCUMENTS,
            adapter=document_vector_adapter,
            model=Document,
            read_permission="documents.read",
            write_permission="documents.update",
            project_id_attr="project_id",
        )
    )

Usage (parent-join, e.g. requirements joined via RequirementSet)::

    from sqlalchemy import select
    from sqlalchemy.orm import selectinload
    from app.modules.requirements.models import Requirement, RequirementSet

    async def _statement(_session, project_id):
        stmt = select(Requirement).options(selectinload(Requirement.requirement_set))
        if project_id is not None:
            stmt = stmt.join(
                RequirementSet,
                Requirement.requirement_set_id == RequirementSet.id,
            ).where(RequirementSet.project_id == project_id)
        return stmt

    router.include_router(
        create_vector_routes(
            collection=COLLECTION_REQUIREMENTS,
            adapter=requirement_vector_adapter,
            statement_factory=_statement,
            read_permission="requirements.read",
            write_permission="requirements.update",
        )
    )

A custom scope returns the SELECT, never its rows.  That is the whole of
the contract, and it is what keeps the bound below in one place: the
factory owns the ordering, the paging, the release and the ceiling for
every module at once, and a module cannot opt out of them by handing
back a list it has already materialised.

# tracemalloc, one loaded ORM row costs 2.5 KiB (a requirement) to 29.7 KiB (a
# validation report, whose ``results`` JSON carries one entry per rule fired);
# documents 2.7, boq positions 2.7 and bim elements 3.1, then tasks 4.7, risks

# that also runs PostgreSQL.  The two highest-count tables in the product are
# among the cheapest per row, so their exposure is cardinality rather than
# weight: a million positions is ~2.5 GiB on its own.
#
# Warm the profiler before trusting any of those: SQLAlchemy bills the first
# instance of a mapped class for instrumenting it, so whichever model is
# measured first reads several KiB too heavy.
#
# Paging the read is only half of the bound: the session keeps every entity it
# hands out until the transaction ends, whatever shape the read had, so each

# collection the platform expects - the startup auto-backfill treats 5 000 rows
# as a normal pass (``vector_backfill_max_rows``) - so reaching it is an
# anomaly rather than a routine event.
#
# Reaching it is reported.  A truncated response that says nothing about being

    This is the whole of the bound, in one place, for every reindex path in
    the platform.  ``create_vector_routes`` calls it for the six modules it
    serves; the two endpoints that cannot use the factory because they carry
    their own permission gating (boq positions, bim elements) call it
    directly.  A reindex that builds its own loop instead is a reindex that
    has to re-derive five separate properties, and the one it forgets will
    not announce itself:

    1. The walk is ORDERED.  Pages are addressed by offset, and an offset
       into an undefined ordering is not a position - the same row can be
       served twice and another skipped with every count still adding up.
    2. The read is PAGED, so the statement never materialises the table.
    3. Each page is FLUSHED before it is released.  Expunging first detaches
       the instances with their work still pending and drops it silently.
    4. Each page is RELEASED, because a ``Session`` holds every entity it
       hands out until the transaction ends whatever shape the read had.
       Paging without releasing moves the allocation around and bounds
       nothing.
    5. The ceiling is REPORTED.  A truncated response that says nothing
       about being truncated is the worse half of the defect.

    Args:
        session: The request's async session.  The walk expunges the rows it
            reads, so anything the caller still needs must be read first.
        adapter: Embedding adapter for the rows the statement selects.
        stmt: SELECT over a mapped entity.  Its own ORDER BY, if any, is
            kept and the primary key is appended as a tiebreaker.
        purge_first: Drop each page's ids from the vector store before
            re-encoding them.

        ``indexed`` / ``skipped`` / ``purged`` / ``collection`` as
        ``reindex_collection`` has always returned them, plus ``scanned``,
        ``cap``, ``truncated`` and a ``message`` describing the bound.
