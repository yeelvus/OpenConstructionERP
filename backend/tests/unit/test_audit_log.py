"""Unit tests for :mod:`app.core.audit_log` (the FSM-aware audit table).

Coverage:
    * ``log_activity`` flushes a row with the expected columns.
    * ``actor_id`` / ``tenant_id`` coerce both str and UUID inputs.
    * ``get_activity_for_entity`` returns the chronological history.
    * ``count_activity_for_entity`` counts the same rows, ignoring paging.
    * ``get_recent_activity`` honours entity_type / action / actor filters.
    * Multiple rows for the same entity are queryable in insertion order.
