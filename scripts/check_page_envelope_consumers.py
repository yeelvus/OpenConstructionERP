"""Refuse a half-migrated collection endpoint.

An endpoint that returns ``{items, total, offset, limit}`` breaks every caller
still expecting a bare array. TypeScript catches most of that, but NOT the
case this guard exists for: React Query caches by key, and the key is a
string. If two files share ``queryKey: ['schedules']`` and only one is
migrated, the cache hands the wrong shape to the other at RUNTIME. ``npm run
build`` is green and the screen is broken.

So the unit of migration is one endpoint plus every consumer of it, in one
commit. This script counts both sides and fails when they disagree.

Usage:
    python scripts/check_page_envelope_consumers.py
    python scripts/check_page_envelope_consumers.py --self-test

Exit codes:
    0  every migrated endpoint has every consumer migrated
    1  at least one endpoint is half migrated
    2  the scan found no consumers at all (broken instrument, not a pass)
