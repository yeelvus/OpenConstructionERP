// Case: "Price a teteles koltsegvetes from norm and rezsioradij" (HU).
//
// The Hungarian itemised bill built the way a Hungarian client reads it. A
// tetel is not one number: it carries a norm behind it, an anyag side and a
// dij side, and the dij is norm hours times a rezsioradij that has to be
// stated rather than assumed. Priced this way the bill answers the question a
// muszaki ellenor and a public client both ask, which is not "how much" but
// "out of what". Content strings are key plus inline English default and live
// only here.

    "A Hungarian koltsegvetes is a document with a shape, not a spreadsheet with a total. Each tetel names the work, the unit and the quantity, and carries a unit price split into anyag and dij. Behind the dij sits a norm, the labour time the work is allowed per unit, and a rezsioradij, the all-in hourly rate that has to cover wage, contributions, small plant, site running costs and company overhead. Priced this way the bill answers the only question anybody asks about a price they did not expect, which is what it is made of. Priced as one number per line it answers nothing, and every conversation about a variation, an extra or a disproportionately low price starts from zero.",
