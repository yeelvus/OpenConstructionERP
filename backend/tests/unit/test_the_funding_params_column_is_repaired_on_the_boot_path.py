"""The half of ``v41_funding_obligation_detail`` that reaches an ordinary install.

The revision tightens ``oe_funding_obligation.detail_params``, and on its own
that reaches almost nobody. The product does not run ``alembic upgrade``: it
moves the schema at boot through the heal and then stamps head, so a revision
body executes only where an operator runs it by hand. The tests beside this
file prove the revision emits the right statements and that PostgreSQL accepts
them, which is worth knowing and is not the same as the column being fixed
anywhere.

These pin the two pieces that do reach an install, one per direction of the
problem.

Backwards, for a database already in the broken shape, the registered repair
``funding_obligation_detail_params_not_null`` does from the boot path what the
revision does from the migration path. Forwards, the model now declares a
``server_default``, which is the only reason the heal will stop producing the
bare column in the first place: without it every newly healed install would
arrive broken and the repair would clean up after it forever.

The repair runs against the real table, deliberately. It is put into the broken
shape first - NOT NULL and DEFAULT dropped, a NULL row written - inside a
transaction that is rolled back, so what is under test is the table the repair
actually names rather than a lookalike. A temporary stand-in would have to be
reached by moving ``search_path``, and ``tighten_not_null`` reads
``information_schema`` filtered on ``current_schema()``, so getting that wrong
returns zero and looks like a clean pass over a table the repair never saw.
