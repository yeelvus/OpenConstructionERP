    ``sid`` names the session this token belongs to, and a token that carries
    one can be revoked on its own. It is optional here on purpose, which is
    worth spelling out because the neighbouring ``issued_at`` argument in
    ``app.dependencies`` is deliberately the opposite. There the callers are
    doors, four of them, and a door that has not decided must fail to start.
    Here most callers are unit tests of this encoder that legitimately mint a
    bare token, and a token without a ``sid`` has to keep validating anyway -
    every session issued before the claim existed carries none. Requiring it
    would therefore buy nothing at the doors and cost twenty-three mechanical
    edits in tests that are not doors.

    What actually stops a session-less pair reaching a user is not this
    signature but :meth:`UserService._issue_token_pair`, the one place in the
    service that mints a pair, together with the test that walks every
    endpoint returning ``TokenResponse`` and resolves the ``sid`` it hands
    back. A signature can only be checked where somebody remembered to look;
    that test fails on any new endpoint that forgets.

    The token deliberately carries only identity claims (``sub``, ``email``,
    ``role``) - NOT the resolved permission list. Permissions are re-hydrated
    from the DB role on every request in ``get_current_user_payload`` (and the
    frontend reads them from ``GET /users/me``), so embedding them here was
    pure dead weight: for an admin it added ~12 KB, pushing the ``Authorization``
    header past the 16 KB limit of Node/Vite dev proxies and yielding HTTP 431
    ("Request Header Fields Too Large") on every authenticated call. See the
    re-hydration note in ``app/dependencies.py``.

        The signup UI promises users can delete their account at any time, so

        another user - the caller's id comes from the authenticated token, and
        the request body carries no id.

        Erasure model: ANONYMIZE in place rather than hard delete. The user row
        is referenced by other tables (projects via owner_id, activity / audit
        rows via actor_id) and the projects FK is ON DELETE CASCADE, so a hard
        delete would silently drag the user's projects (and their BOQs, costs,

        replace the email with a non-reversible placeholder, invalidate the

        row survives so foreign keys stay intact, but it holds no personal data
        and can no longer authenticate.

        Confirmation guard:
          - A password account must re-supply ``current_password``; we verify
            it against the stored hash and raise 400 on a mismatch.
          - A passwordless / SSO account (no usable hash) must instead type the
            literal ``DELETE`` into ``confirm``; anything else raises 400.

        Tenant safety: refuses to erase the last remaining active admin so the
        workspace is never orphaned without an administrator - returns 409 with
        guidance to promote another admin first.

        Until now an administrator could only deactivate an account
        (``is_active=False``); the row, and its email, stayed on the books. This
        gives the admin the same erasure the account owner already has, so a
        workspace can actually remove a member rather than only suspend them
        (issue #272).

        Same anonymise-in-place model as :py:meth:`erase_account`, but authorised
        by an administrator instead of the account owner, so it carries no
        password / confirm guard - the caller has already passed the
        ``users.delete`` permission check.

        Guards:
          - 400 if an admin targets their own id: self-deletion must go through
            ``DELETE /users/me`` so it keeps its password confirmation.
          - 404 if the target does not exist or is already erased.
          - 409 if the target is the last active admin, so the workspace is never
            left without an administrator.
