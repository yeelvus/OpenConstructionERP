"""Cost-plus and T&M claims bill their own period, and the cap counts all billing.

Two defects, one on each contract type without a schedule of values:

* Net due was ``gross - retention - what earlier claims were paid``, although
  the costs and time entries on a claim are that period's. Every payment was
  taken off every later claim again.
* The T&M not-to-exceed cap was checked against what had been paid, so any
  claim still awaiting payment did not count towards it, and a contract could
  bill past its cap as long as the owner paid slowly.
