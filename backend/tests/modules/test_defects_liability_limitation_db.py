"""Database tests for the opt-in limitation regime on a warranty entry.

The pure tests in ``tests/unit/test_defects_liability_limitation.py`` drive the
derivation helper directly. These drive the two service methods that actually
write - ``create_warranty`` and ``update_warranty`` - through a real session,
because the whole opt-in turns on which fields a payload set, and
``exclude_unset`` only means anything on a real Pydantic payload going through
the real method.

The question every test here asks is the same one: does an entry that never chose
a limitation regime behave exactly as it did before the column existed. The
regime-free cases are written with a start date present and a period already
recorded, so an implementation that started deriving whenever the arithmetic was
possible would fail them rather than pass them by accident.
