"""The hook config and the lanes may diverge, but only on purpose.

``.pre-commit-config.yaml`` declares 39 hooks and exactly two of them run when
you commit here. Thirty-five sit at the default pre-commit stage and none of
those run at all, because there is no ``.git/hooks/pre-commit``. One more,
``conventional-pre-commit``, is staged for commit-msg and does not run either.
One is manual by declaration. The two that run are ``check_commit_subject.py``
and ``check_commit_trailers.py``, and they run because a hand-written
``commit-msg`` shim calls the scripts directly rather than through pre-commit.
The shim says so itself, and it exists because twelve commits once shipped with
a shell fragment as their subject.

An earlier version of this docstring said 38 and thirty-four. Both were wrong,
and nothing had changed in the config: the count was simply taken badly. The
numbers above come from ``yaml.safe_load`` over the file and from reading
``.git/hooks/`` for what is installed, which is the only pair of sources that
can answer this, since a declaration and an executable are two artefacts.

That is survivable, and measurably so. Every script named by a local hook is
also invoked by at least one workflow, 26 of 26, so nothing is guarded by the
config alone. The traffic runs the other way. Twenty ``check_*.py`` scripts are
invoked by a workflow and declared by no hook, and they arrived one at a time,
by nobody adding the second half rather than by anyone deciding the second half
was wrong.

The clearest case is a pair. ``check_locale_escapes.py`` guards a locale escape
corrupted by a doubled backslash, and it is a declared hook.
``check_locale_lost_escapes.py`` opens by naming itself the second direction of
that same defect, the backslash stripped instead of doubled, over the same files
at the same cost. It is not declared. Nobody chose that.

So this file does not try to make the two lists equal. That would mean two
hundred lines of YAML enforcing nothing, on a checkout with no pre-commit hook
to run it. It makes the difference explicit instead: a script that runs in a
lane and not on a commit has to appear in one of the two maps below, and the
count of the ones carrying no reason may only go down.

Installing pre-commit is not the fix and is closer to the opposite of one. It
would switch on 34 hooks for every commit in a tree that takes one every few
minutes, several of which walk the whole source tree.
