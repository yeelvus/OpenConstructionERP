"""The set of data repairs, read from source instead of from the registry.

Why a second reading exists at all
----------------------------------
``tests/pg/test_data_repairs.py`` used to check a repair pass with
``assert report.attempted == len(DATA_REPAIRS)``. Both sides of that comparison
come out of ``app.core.data_repairs._REGISTRY``: the report is built by running
what the registry holds, and the length is the registry's own length. A repair
that drops out of the registry - its module failed to import, its registration
was deleted, discovery was narrowed - takes both sides down together and the
assertion still holds. It could not fail for the reason it was written for, and
"every repair ran" and "no repair ran" were the same green.

So the count has to come from somewhere the registry cannot move. This module
reads the ``register_data_repair()`` calls out of ``app/**/repairs.py`` as text,
which is what ``scripts/check_data_rewrite_boot_repair.py`` already does for the
migration gate. It reuses that scan rather than repeating it, so the gate and
the tests cannot end up disagreeing about which repairs exist, and it is
independent in the way that matters: a module that fails to import still has its
registration sitting in the file, so the source reading keeps the id the runtime
just lost.

The floor below is not decoration. A source scan that comes back empty makes
every comparison built on it vacuously true, which is the same defect one level
up, so an empty read is refused rather than reported as agreement.
