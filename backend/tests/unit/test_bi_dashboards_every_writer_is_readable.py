"""A report reads like a document in every format it is offered in.

``build_report`` dispatches on ``output_format``, which is a per-report
setting somebody chose once. The readability work that stopped the PDF
printing ``breakdown__ac_by_currency`` and ``{'EUR': Decimal('100000.00')}``
reached exactly one of the three writers, and the other two shipped the
original defect:

* the XLSX shared the cell formatter and not the heading logic, so the
  same report opened as a spreadsheet still had ``breakdown__ac_by_currency``
  across the top;
* the CSV shared neither, so it stringified through ``str`` and wrote a
  Python dict repr into a cell.

**The assertions here are per format, deliberately.** The tests that came
with the PDF fix read the PDF only, and that is the whole reason two
writers stayed broken through a change whose commit message said the fix
was shared. A test suite that checks the one format somebody happened to
be looking at cannot tell "fixed" from "fixed in the format under the
lamp", so the last test in the first section asserts the three formats
agree with each other rather than each agreeing with itself.

A second defect only shows up in a cell: a ``top_by`` KPI's breakdown is
``{group: {"label": ..., "value": ...}}`` and ``run_report`` flattens one
level, so ``_format_cell`` receives the inner record and printed
``label: Precast beam; value: 12345.6789``. Those two words are field
names from the query layer, printed at the reader.
