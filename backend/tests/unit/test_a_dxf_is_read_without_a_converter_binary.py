"""A DXF must open on a host that has no converter binary for its CPU.

The DWG, RVT and DGN converters are proprietary x86-64 binaries. ``.dxf`` was
routed to the DWG one through a format alias, so an ARM host could not open a
DXF even though the platform already reads DXF in pure Python for the takeoff
module. These tests pin the native path and, more importantly, pin the reason
the alias made it invisible: the caller resolves the alias BEFORE calling the
conversion, so the extension argument says "dwg" for a file that is a DXF.
