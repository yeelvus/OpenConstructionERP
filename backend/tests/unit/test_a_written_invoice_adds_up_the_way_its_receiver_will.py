"""Does the invoice we emit add up, measured the way its receiver adds it up?

BR-CO-10 says the document line total (BT-106) is the sum of the line net
amounts (BT-131), with no tolerance. A receiver checks that against the figures
written in the file, so this test does too: it renders the document, parses it
back, and sums the strings that were actually emitted.

Going through ``check()`` instead would measure the same rounding twice. That
validator rounds both sides of the comparison before comparing them, which is
correct for the object it is handed and blind to a document whose own written
figures disagree. The subject here is the emitted document, not the object.

The four currencies put the one that always worked beside the three that did
not: EUR carries two minor units, JPY, HUF and CLP carry none. Only on a
zero-decimal currency can an amount be written differently from the way it was
added up, and only then does an accumulated total drift away from its own
lines. BR-CO-15 and BR-CO-16 are here for the same reason, at fractions chosen
to sit on the rounding boundary, because a total that reconciles at one value
says nothing about the value next to it.

Nothing here asserts how many minor units a currency has. That is independence
from the question, not a note that the question is open: HUF and IDR are
settled at zero, in ``app.core.money`` and again in
``app.modules.einvoice.rules``, each with its reasoning recorded beside it.
Every assertion below compares the document against itself, so it holds at the
count those two record today and would still hold if either were revisited.
