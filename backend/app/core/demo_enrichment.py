"""Reusable per-module demo enrichment.

The rich per-module demo seeders (photos, takeoff, BIM grouping, clash,
carbon, QMS, advanced scheduling, cost model, MoC, supplier catalogs,
variations, accommodation, markups, catalog, plus CRM / service / bid /
HSE / portal / tendering) used to run only inline at first boot in
``app/main.py``. The in-app partner-pack apply paths installed the demo
project's BOQ / budget / schedule / tender / BIM model / PDFs but never ran
these enrichment seeders, so a pack applied from the Modules page after boot
opened with empty photos / takeoff / clash / carbon / qms / variations /
costmodel / moc / markups / catalog.

This module extracts that seeder list into one reusable, fail-soft coroutine
so both boot AND the pack-apply paths run the exact same enrichment. Each
seeder runs in its own DB session inside its own ``try/except`` so a single
seeder (or a single project) failing never aborts the rest, never aborts the
pack apply and never aborts boot.

No new DB tables: this only orchestrates seeders that already exist.
