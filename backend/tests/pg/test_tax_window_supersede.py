"""Nova Scotia's rate cut, against the install that never received it.

What is under test
------------------
``tax_window_supersede`` closes a shipped tax window an old install still holds
open and inserts the rate that replaced it. The live case is Nova Scotia, which
cut its harmonised rate from 15 % to 14 % on 2025-04-01: the seed file carries
both windows, an install seeded before v15.5.0 holds only the 15 % one, and
until this repair existed it went on charging 15 % for ever while
``/api/health`` reported a clean boot.

Where the cohorts come from
---------------------------
From ``test_tax_seed_reconcile``, deliberately, rather than rebuilt here. Those
fixtures reconstruct the seed files two releases actually shipped and carry a
digest of the real file so the reconstruction cannot drift, and a second
hand-written copy of a database state is the thing that quietly stops matching
the one customers have. The important property for this file is in
``_RESTORED_TO_V15_4_0``: it puts Nova Scotia's 15 % window back to open, which
is the entire defect.

What every assertion here is written against
--------------------------------------------
The resolved rate, through ``resolve``, rather than the column the repair
wrote. Which column a repair writes says nothing about what a Canadian firm is
charged - the two questions came apart on this table once already - so the
claim being made is "Nova Scotia is billed 14 %", and that is what is asserted.
Ontario is carried through every whole-registry test as a control: same
country, same ``replaces_federal`` class, the same ``effective_from`` as Nova
Scotia's old window, one window only. A predicate that closed windows on
anything broader than the rate line moves it.

Why the row counts are taken per line
-------------------------------------
This file counted ``DataRepairOutcome.rows_changed``, the run's own total, and
that stopped being a statement about Nova Scotia when Israel entered the
repair's derived population - see ``_LINE_UNDER_TEST``. The counts are taken on
the rate line under test now. The rule is the same one the paragraph above
states: assert the claim the test's name makes, not the nearest number the
machinery happens to expose.

    A province that has been billed the wrong rate for a year is one somebody
    may well have corrected by hand, under their own tax code. Two rates each
    replacing the federal one in one province is not a wrong number: ``resolve``
    raises, and the province stops pricing at all. It does so before this repair
    runs and it would do so afterwards, so applying would edit their data and
    buy nothing.

    Two things are asserted, and the second is the one that is easy to miss.
    The repair leaves the rows alone, and it does not come back ``failed`` - a
    guard that let the resolver's exception out would turn an install this
    repair had already decided not to touch into a red health check on every
    boot for the life of the install.

    That second claim is asserted as "not failed" rather than as ``clean``
    because the pass legitimately applies elsewhere: the same cohort is
    stranded on the Israeli window, which this repair closes in the same run.
    ``clean`` would be asserting that the repair did nothing anywhere, which is
    a statement about the population rather than about the guard.
