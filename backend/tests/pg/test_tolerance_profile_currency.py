"""PG: v3306 lands on tolerance profiles that already exist.

``env.py`` short-circuits a blank database to ``create_all`` plus
``stamp heads``, so "empty database, upgrade head" runs no revision at all and
still reports success. Any claim about what a migration does to existing rows
has to be made against a table built in its pre-migration shape and filled,
which is what this file does.

The claim being checked is the two-case one the revision rests on. There is no
way to recover the currency of an existing absolute floor - a profile is
global and has no order to inherit from - but only a nonzero floor needs one.
A floor of zero is the same amount of money in every currency, so NULL loses
nothing. The upgrade therefore classifies rather than guesses, and counts the
rows it cannot classify instead of assuming there are none.

Gated by ``OE_TEST_DB=pg`` (see conftest).
