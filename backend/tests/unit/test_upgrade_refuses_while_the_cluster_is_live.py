"""An upgrade must not overwrite the binaries it is running from.

``pip install --upgrade`` replaces files in site-packages, and on this install
some of those files are executing: the embedded PostgreSQL binaries ship inside
pixeltable_pgserver, so ``postgres`` runs from the same tree pip is about to
rewrite. On Windows the running image is locked and pip fails partway, leaving
an install that is neither version. Elsewhere it succeeds and the live process
becomes a mixture, because this codebase imports inside functions and every
later import reads the new file.

So the question the upgrade has to ask is not ``is_running()``, which answers
about the calling process and is always False in the short-lived CLI. It is
"does this machine have a postmaster serving that data directory", and the only
honest source for that is the operating system, not the pidfile: the pidfile
outlives an unclean stop, and a leftover must not be the reason an upgrade
refuses.

Both directions are asserted here. A checker that never refuses is the bug
being fixed; a checker that always refuses replaces a torn install with an
install nobody can perform.

"Is the machine running a postmaster" has a second half that is easy to miss:
the number in the pidfile has to still belong to the postmaster that wrote it.
Operating systems reuse process identifiers, Windows quickly, so a pidfile left
by a force-killed postmaster eventually names an unrelated service. Reading
that as a live cluster is the always-refuses failure in its worst form, because
it never clears on its own. Both polarities of that are asserted too.
