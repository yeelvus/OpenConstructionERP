// `(12550880.81).toLocaleString()` does not read the language the reader chose
// in the header. It reads the BROWSER's locale, which is a different thing:
// a German estimator working on an English-locale laptop got `12,550,880.81`
// in a tile above rows reading `12.550.880,81`, and switching the app to
// German changed nothing, because nothing in that call ever asked what the app
// was set to. The same goes for `toLocaleDateString`, `toLocaleTimeString`,
// and any `Intl.*Format` built with `undefined` as the locale.
//
// 308 call sites were rewritten to pass `getIntlLocale()`, the app's own
// mapping from the i18next language to a BCP-47 tag. This gate stops the
// shape coming back.
//
// It then grew a second half for `toFixed`, which is the same defect by a
// different route: that method takes no locale at all, so no argument fixes it
// and 455 call sites had to move onto a formatter instead. The two halves are
// in one file because they are one question - is this number written in the
// reader's language - and a reviewer looking for the answer should not have to
// know which method the author happened to reach for.
//
// It is deliberately separate from `formattersReadTheLocalePerCall.test.ts`,
// which asks a different question of the same call: that one catches a
// formatter that reads the RIGHT locale but only once, at chunk load. A site
// can pass either gate and fail the other, so both run.
