    tidiness argument: it is the defect this function was extracted to close.
    ``run_data_repairs`` returns ``ledger_written`` separately from the repair
    outcomes on purpose - a repair can succeed against a database whose role
    may write rows but not create tables, leaving the data correct and the
    *record* of it missing - and the boot path published the outcomes and threw

    repair run on this install", which is the only question a ledger exists for.

    ``discovery_failures`` is the same mistake one step earlier and is folded
    into ``data_repairs_failed`` here. A module whose ``repairs.py`` did not
    import registers nothing, so its repairs are absent from ``failed`` for the
    only reason ``failed`` can be read: that property lists repairs that RAN and
    raised. Reading it alone answered ``false`` for a module broken badly enough

    the only evidence that anything is happening is what this process writes.

    Several startup phases are long and internally silent. Building the route
    table takes 32.1s on a quiet machine and 58.6s under load, and it writes one
    line when it finishes; the module load, the migrations and first-run seeding

    honest requirement is that no phase is silent for longer than the interval,
    not that the phases we have measured are short enough.

    A thread, not an ``asyncio`` task, and the difference is not stylistic. The

    """Build the router's per-route state, and report how long it took.

    FastAPI does not build a route's dependant tree, its response field or its
    operation id when the route is registered. It builds them the first time a
    request reaches route matching, for every route at once, under a lock -
    ``_EffectiveRouteContext.from_api_route`` on each candidate, which compiles
    a regex per operation id and runs ``get_dependant`` over every signature.
    With ~190 module routers mounted that is a large one-off cost, and until
    this existed it was paid inside the first request to arrive.

    Measured on this stand, warm data directory, OpenAPI priming off: the first
    request after boot took 32.1s and the second took 0.04s. The path did not
    matter - ``GET /`` is a static ``index.html`` that touches no database and
    no dependency, and it paid the full 32s exactly as ``/api/health`` did when
    it happened to arrive first. The work runs on the event loop, so everything
    else queued behind it: a health check issued at the same moment as that
    first request answered 33.9s later, five times the desktop launcher's own
    12s probe deadline. From outside, a port that accepts a connection and then
    says nothing for half a minute is indistinguishable from a hung process,
    which is precisely what a watchdog is built to kill.

    Doing it here does not make the work cheaper and is not meant to. It moves
    it to the one place where nobody is waiting on a socket: uvicorn binds the
    listening socket only after the startup lifespan returns, so a client either
    cannot connect yet - which every launcher and healthcheck already handles,
    and which the boot log is narrating a step at a time - or connects to a
    process that answers immediately.

    The warm-up is a synthetic ASGI request rather than a call into FastAPI's
    internals, so it exercises whatever the real first visitor would exercise
    and keeps working if the private names behind it are renamed. It is aimed at
    :data:`ROUTE_TABLE_WARMUP_PATH`, which matches nothing, because a request
    that matches nothing is the one that forces every candidate to be built. It
    is sent to ``app.router`` and not to ``app``: the middleware stack has
    nothing to warm and would only put a fictitious request in the slow-request
    log and the access log.

    1. Reads the live row count from Postgres
    2. Reads the indexed row count from the vector store
    3. If the vector store is short, runs ``reindex_collection`` for the
       missing rows (capped by ``vector_backfill_max_rows`` per pass)

    task so startup completes immediately even if the model loader has
    to download a fresh embedding checkpoint.

    Which *data directory* is being served, as against which process is serving
    it. ``_INSTANCE_ID`` answers the second question and cannot be made to
    answer the first: it is a fresh uuid4 per process, so it differs across a
    restart of one install exactly as it differs between two installs, which
    makes it useless to anyone trying to tell those two cases apart. Hence a
    second field rather than a reuse of that one.

    Two properties are load bearing, and both are asserted in
    ``tests/unit/test_a_second_user_on_one_machine_is_a_second_workspace.py``.

    The value is opaque random bytes, never a path and never anything derived
    from an account name. ``/api/health`` is unauthenticated on purpose, so on
    any deployment whose port is reachable this value is readable by whoever can
    reach it, and an id built out of the data directory would publish the disk
    layout and the operating-system user of the machine serving it.

    And it is persisted, so it survives a restart. A value regenerated per boot
    would make a launcher refuse to attach to the backend it started itself, and
    the cost of refusing is not "look elsewhere", it is a second server started
    against the running one's data directory.

    Created with ``O_EXCL`` rather than written to a temporary file and renamed
    over. Renaming is the usual idiom here (``_write_demo_backfill_version``
    below uses it) and is the wrong one for this file: rename replaces what it
    finds, on POSIX and on Windows alike, so two processes starting together
    would each write an id and the loser would be left holding one that is no
    longer on disk. ``O_EXCL`` is create-if-absent in a single syscall, so the
    first writer wins and every later one reads that same value back.

    Returns ``None`` when the directory cannot be read or written - a read-only
    mount, a full disk. That omits the field from the health body, which fails
    closed: a launcher with no identity of its own attaches to nothing, and a
    candidate that publishes none is refused. Never raises, because a container
    healthcheck reads this endpoint and a 500 there is a worse outcome than an
    installation that declines to be attached to.

    # Three states, and they are three: ``False`` healed, ``True`` failed,
    # ``None`` never ran. The last one is not a corner case. The heal lives
    # inside ``if "postgresql" in settings.database_url`` in the startup below,
    # so a deployment whose ``DATABASE_URL`` is not PostgreSQL never reaches it
    # and stays at this value for its whole life. Reporting that as ``False``
    # says "healed fine" about a heal that never happened, which is exactly the
    # mistake ``alembic_head_state`` exists to stop making one field away in the
    # same health payload.
    #
    # It is also the value between building the application and startup writing
    # a verdict. That window is not visible to an HTTP caller - the server does
    # not accept requests until the lifespan startup returns, and a startup that
    # raises takes the process down rather than serving - but it is visible to
    # anything holding the application object directly, an in-process ASGI test
    # client included.
    #
    # The signal exists because the heal is deliberately non-fatal, and a
    # non-fatal failure that only reaches the log is invisible on the deployment
    # it actually ruins: an external PostgreSQL whose role has no DDL rights.
    # There the heal cannot add a single column, the application starts and
    # looks fine, and the first read of any table that gained a column since
    # that database was created answers 500 with an undefined-column error.
    #
    # ``schema_heal_error`` holds the cause for the boot log and for an operator
    # with access to this process. It is deliberately NOT published by
    # ``/api/health``; see that endpoint's docstring for why.
    #
    # Both live on ``app.state`` rather than in a module global because a module
    # global outlives the application it describes: in one process that builds a
    # second application - which the test suite does routinely - that second one
    # would inherit the first one's verdict about a database it never opened.
    app.state.schema_heal_failed = None
    app.state.schema_heal_error = None

    # ── Does the schema still match the models ───────────────────────────
    # The field above says whether the heal RAISED. This one says whether the
    # database and the models agree once it has finished, which is a different
    # question with a different answer: the heal completes successfully and
    # still leaves a NOT NULL it could not carry, because adding one to a
    # populated table fails and adding the column nullable does not. Three
    # states again - True they agree, False they do not, None never asked,
    # which is where a deployment whose database is not PostgreSQL stays.
    app.state.schema_matches_models = None
    app.state.schema_divergent_columns = ()

    # ── And whether that question was ever answered ──────────────────────
    # The field above has three states and two of them were sharing a value.
    # Its ``None`` said "never asked", and the check that fills it catches
    # everything it can raise and leaves the field alone - so a diagnostic that
    # crashed published exactly what a deployment with no PostgreSQL publishes,
    # and no reader could tell "this database is not one I check" from "I tried
    # to look and could not". That is the whole failure this file keeps finding
    # in other shapes: an absent answer wearing a reassuring one's clothes.
    #
    # Three states of its own, polarity of the ``_failed`` fields beside it:
    # ``True`` the check raised, ``False`` it ran to a verdict, ``None`` it was
    # never reached. Read with ``is True``. It does not degrade the status - a
    # diagnostic whose own bug takes it down says nothing about the deployment,
    # and degrading on it would report our defects as the operator's.
    app.state.schema_match_check_failed = None

    # ── Constraints the boot could not get verified ──────────────────────
    # The divergence check above asks about nullability and only about
    # nullability, while the heal has two other ways to leave the database
    # short of what the models declare: it adds every CHECK and FOREIGN KEY as
    # ``NOT VALID``, and until the validation pass landed nothing ever ran
    # ``VALIDATE CONSTRAINT``. So ``schema_matches_models`` could answer
    # ``True`` on a database holding rows that violate a constraint the models
    # declare - and worse than unverified, those rows are unwritable, because
    # a CHECK is re-evaluated on every UPDATE of a row whatever column the
    # update names. This says so.
    #
    # Published as a fact of its own and NOT folded into
    # ``schema_matches_models``: one field answers one question, and this one
    # is answered by a catalog column rather than by a model comparison.
    #
    # Three states: ``True`` every CHECK and FOREIGN KEY in this schema is
    # validated, ``False`` at least one is not, ``None`` nobody asked. A
    # determinable ``False`` degrades - see the endpoint for why that only
    # became defensible once the boot started validating.
    app.state.schema_constraints_validated = None

    # ── Did this database arrive holding tables it never recorded ────────
    # Asked before any DDL, because ``create_all`` makes it unanswerable, and
    # until now the answer was a local variable that reached the stamp and
    # nothing else. What that cost: this cohort records no revision, so
    # ``alembic_head_matches`` publishes ``None`` for it, and ``None`` is what a
    # desktop bundle carrying no migration tree publishes too - the one
    # population that cannot vouch for its schema reads identical to the one
    # that was never asked to.
    #
    # Three states: ``True`` it held application tables and named no revision,
    # ``False`` it did not, ``None`` the question could not be put. It does NOT
    # degrade, and the reason is a cohort the predicate cannot separate out:
    # ``True`` is equally what an install gets whose schema ``create_all`` built
    # correctly and whose stamp write then failed - that failure is caught and
    # logged further down, and the boot after it sees tables with no revision
    # and refuses the stamp, permanently. Degrading here would pin a current
    # schema to degraded for the life of the database on the strength of one
    # lost write.
    app.state.arrived_populated_unstamped = None

    # ── Boot-time data-repair verdict ────────────────────────────────────
    # Same three states, for the same reason, about the other half of an
    # upgrade. The heal above moves the SCHEMA; it rewrites no rows, so a
    # migration whose body backfills, renames or de-duplicates never executes
    # on any install brought up this way while ``alembic_version`` reports head.
    # ``app.core.data_repairs`` is where the rewrites that have to reach those
    # installs are written instead, and this is the verdict of running them.
    #
    # ``None`` is again "never ran", which covers a non-PostgreSQL deployment
    # and the window before startup writes a verdict. ``True`` means rows that
    # should have been rewritten were not, either because a repair raised or
    # because the module holding it never imported and so registered nothing to
    # run. The ids are in ``data_repairs_failed_ids``, where an unimported
    # module is marked apart from a repair id, and the causes are in the log.
    app.state.data_repairs_failed = None
    app.state.data_repairs_failed_ids = ()

    # ── Boot-time data-repair LEDGER verdict ─────────────────────────────
    # The other half of the same report, and a genuinely different failure.
    # ``run_data_repairs`` writes a row per repair to ``oe_data_repair_ledger``
    # recording what it did and under which release, and that write can fail on
    # its own: an external database whose role may write rows but not create
    # tables gets correct data and no record of it. Collapsing the two into one
    # field would let the smaller failure hide behind the larger, so the runner
    # reports them separately and so does this.
    #
    # Same three states as the field above, same polarity: ``None`` the pass
    # never ran, ``False`` every ledger row was written, ``True`` at least one
    # write failed. ``False`` here cannot be mistaken for "did not run", because
    # a pass that did not run never leaves ``None``.

        This endpoint is UNAUTHENTICATED on purpose. The desktop shell polls it

        backend that is already running rather than start a second one against
        the same data directory, and container healthchecks want the same answer
        on the same terms. So everything here is public, and nothing here may
        carry text describing the internals of the deployment.

        That is why the schema-heal signal below is a boolean and only a
        boolean. What it reports is a database exception, and SQLAlchemy DBAPI
        errors stringify with the statement appended - ``[SQL: ALTER TABLE
        ...]``, frequently ``[parameters: ...]`` too - so putting the message in
        this payload would hand an anonymous caller the schema and the statement
        text of the deployment it can reach. The cause is written in full to the
        boot log, where the operator of that machine is, and is kept on
        ``app.state.schema_heal_error``. Should it ever be wanted over HTTP it
        belongs behind ``RequireRole("admin")``, beside
        ``/api/system/upgrade/status``, and not here.

        The same rule governs the two signals added since: which data repairs
        failed, and which repair modules could not be imported at all, is on
        ``app.state.data_repairs_failed_ids``, and which columns the schema has
        diverged on is on ``app.state.schema_divergent_columns``. Both are
        lists of internal names - a module path maps the deployment quite as
        well as a repair id does - and both stay in the log for the same reason
        the failing statement does.

        # determinable ``false`` degrades.
        #
        # That degrade is new and it is only defensible because the validation

        # remove one and keep the other. Before the pass, ``false`` was the
        # standing state of every install the heal had ever added a constraint
        # to, and it never cleared, so degrading on it would have lit a
        # permanent cause across that whole population - which is how the stale
        # alembic stamp stopped being a signal. After it, ``false`` means
        # PostgreSQL was asked to verify a constraint and the rows refused, and
        # that is not an unverified constraint but an unwritable row: a CHECK is
        # re-evaluated on every UPDATE of a row whatever column the update
        # names, so whichever screen edits that row answers 500 until somebody
        # corrects it. An install carrying one is not healthy in any sense its
        # operator would recognise. It is also actionable and it clears itself:
        # correct the rows and the next start validates the constraint.
        #
        # And it is narrow. The pass runs after this boot's declared data

        # for. That is what makes it worth an operator's morning.
        #

        # all - a lock timeout on a busy table, a role without rights. That

        Returns ``202`` with a job id as soon as the work is scheduled;
        poll ``GET /api/system/upgrade/status`` for the outcome and the
        pip log. It used to run inline and answer only when pip was
        finished, which no browser waits for: the client gave up at 45
        seconds and reported a failure over an upgrade still in progress
        (issue #430). Worse, with a single worker the whole server was
        unreachable while it ran.

        Asking again while one is running answers ``409`` with that job
        rather than starting a second pip against the same site-packages.

        We shell out to the **same** interpreter that's serving the API so
        the upgrade lands in the right venv (Issue #96 - Windows launcher
        uses ``%LOCALAPPDATA%/OpenConstructionERP/venv``, not the user's
        global Python).

        **Important - the running process keeps the OLD wheel in memory.**
        Python caches imports; pip can replace files on disk but cannot
        swap modules already loaded. The finished job carries
        ``restart_required=true`` and the new version pulled from
        ``importlib.metadata`` so the UI can prompt the user to restart
        their launcher (``openconstructionerp serve``) or, on managed
        installs, the host's systemd unit.

        **Admin only.** Requires an authenticated user with the ``admin``

        # module loader runs inside this same handler, above, and the handful
        # of alias mounts that follow it are the last include_router calls in
        # the file. Priming from create_app() would cache a document built
        # before ~190 module routers existed, and a schema that is missing
        # most of the API is worse than a schema that is slow.
        #
        # Deliberately not awaited. Starlette accepts no requests until this
        # handler returns, so awaiting a ~141s build would move the stall off
        # the first docs visitor and onto every user of the app, including the
        # health check.
        #
        # The thread is worth being precise about, because this is CPU-bound
        # Python and a thread does not escape the GIL: it does not make the
        # build free, it makes it interruptible. Building on the event loop
        # blocks every request for the whole build. A visitor who arrives
        # before it finishes waits on the same lock rather than starting a
        # second build. The task is parked on app.state because asyncio keeps
        # only a weak reference to a bare task and would otherwise be free to
        # collect it mid-build.
        #
        # What the thread does NOT buy is a responsive process, and the line
        # that used to stand here said it did: "requests are served throughout,
        # just slower while it runs - health answered in 17.1s, 0.7s and 2.2s".
        # Re-measured against a boot whose route table was already warm, so the
        # build is the only thing running: the first request after the port
        # opened took 64.6s of a 73.0s build, and the two after it 2.3s and
        # 2.2s before latency came back to 0.15s. So the loop is starved
        # outright for most of the build and eases only at the end, and 17.1s
        # was a sample from that tail rather than the worst of it. The old
        # figure is left quoted here rather than deleted because it is the
        # premise this prime was justified on, and the correction is the reason
        # the prime is now off by default.
        #
        # Runtime module toggles stay correct without help here: enabling or
        # disabling a module moves the route counter that _custom_openapi
        # checks, so the next request rebuilds rather than serving a document
        # that describes the wrong set of modules.
        # Only where something can actually serve the result. ``openapi_url``
        # is None in production - BUG-394 keeps the route map off a public
        # deployment - and /api/docs and /api/redoc go with it, so a production
        # boot has no consumer for this document at all. Priming there would
        # spend the whole build on a 2 GB VPS to fill a cache nothing reads,
        # and spend it in the window where requests are already answering
        # slowly, which is how a healthcheck timeout turns into a restart loop.
        #
        # And it is now off unless somebody asks for it, which is a change of
        # default and not a change of mechanism. Everything the paragraphs above
        # say about the build is still true and still measured: 118.2s on a warm
        # data directory before the route table was warmed at boot, 73.0s after
        # it, 133.9s on a first run, 2923 paths every time. What the measurement
        # added is who pays. The document has exactly three consumers -
        # /api/docs, /api/redoc, /api/openapi.json - and none of them is on the
        # startup path, so every desktop launch and every
        # ``openconstructionerp serve`` was spending over a minute of a core, in
        # the window where the user is staring at a splash screen, to fill a
        # cache that install would never read.
        #
        # Whoever does open the reference pages pays the build on that request,
        # cached and locked by _custom_openapi exactly as before, which is what
        # this deployment did until the prime was added. An operator serving the
