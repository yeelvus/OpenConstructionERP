"""A country code must select that country's working week, not another country's.

``schedule.service.get_work_calendar`` picks the working week that
``compute_duration`` and the schedule generator count days with. It resolves a
region string by taking the head of the string before the first underscore and
looking it up in one dict.

That one dict holds two vocabularies at once. Most of its keys are ISO 3166-1
alpha-2 country codes, which is what the shipped CWICR catalogue uses today
(``BR_SAOPAULO``, ``CA_TORONTO``, ``AR_BUENOSAIRES``, ``PT_LISBON``). A few are
heads of a superseded catalogue naming that keyed regions by language instead
(``ZH_SHANGHAI``, ``HI_MUMBAI``, ``SP_BARCELONA``, ``AR_DUBAI``,
``PT_SAOPAULO``) - every one of which ``core.match_service.region_language``
already renames to its ISO form.

Where the two vocabularies disagreed, the language reading used to win:

* ``AR`` means Arabic in the old naming and Argentina in ISO, so Buenos Aires
  was given the Gulf calendar.
* ``PT`` means Portuguese in the old naming and Portugal in ISO, so Lisbon was
  given the Brazilian week of six days.
* ``CA`` is Canada in ISO and appeared in neither reading, so the Canada
  calendar was unreachable by any country code at all.

The Gulf calendar has since been split in two, because the six GCC states do
not share one week: five work Sunday to Thursday and the UAE works Monday to
Friday. ``AE`` and its neighbours therefore resolve to different calendars.

This file asserts the ISO reading, over the whole of ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 rather
than over a hand-picked sample, so a future key that reintroduces the confusion
is caught by the sweep instead of by a customer.

Two neighbouring structures are deliberately *not* asserted on here, because
neither is what the date arithmetic reads:

* ``core.calendar._WORKING_WEEK`` maps a country to a bare frozenset of
  weekdays with no hours and no label. It belongs to another change in flight;
  this file imports it read-only to prove the shape differs, and never writes
  it.
* ``i18n_foundation``'s ``WorkCalendar`` rows carry ``work_hours_per_day`` and
  ISO weekday numbers where Monday is 1.

``WORK_CALENDARS`` carries ``hours_per_day`` and ``work_days`` where Monday is
0, and those are the field names and the convention the two consumers read.
``test_shape_proves_which_structure_the_arithmetic_reads`` pins that down.
