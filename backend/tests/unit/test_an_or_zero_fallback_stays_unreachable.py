"""The ``or "0"`` money fallback must stay unreachable.

Several response schemas serialize money through a private helper and then add
``or "0"`` at the call site::

    @field_serializer("grand_total", when_used="json")
    def _ser_money(cls, v: Decimal) -> str:
        return _serialize_money_string(v) or "0"

The helper returns ``None`` for ``None``, so that ``or`` converts exactly one
input class: an absent value becomes the string ``"0"``, which a client cannot
tell apart from a real zero. Measured on the shape above, an OPTIONAL field
serializes ``None`` and ``Decimal("0")`` both to ``{'amount': '0'}``.

Today that cannot happen, because every field these serializers guard is
annotated as a required ``Decimal``. Pydantic refuses ``None`` for a required
field, both directly and through ``from_attributes`` over an ORM row with a
NULL column, and the one construct that skips validation entirely,
``model_construct``, is used nowhere in ``app``.

So the fallback is not dead code, it is a landmine. It is unreachable because
of a property of the OTHER 120 declarations, not because of anything at the 51
fallbacks themselves. Making any one of those fields optional arms all of them
at once. This test is the tripwire: relax an annotation and it fails here,
with this docstring attached, rather than shipping zeros that look real.

This codifies existing practice rather than introducing a rule.
``property_dev/schemas.py`` already splits its money serializers on exactly
this distinction: ``_ser_money_required`` covers the required fields and ends
in ``or "0"``, while ``_ser_money_opt`` covers the optional ones, carries no
fallback, and returns ``str | None`` so an absent value serializes as null.
``computed_price`` sits correctly on the optional one.

If you are here because this test failed, you have two honest options. Keep the
field required, or drop the ``or "0"`` from its serializer so an absent value
serializes as ``null`` and stays distinguishable from a real zero. Do not
silence the test.
