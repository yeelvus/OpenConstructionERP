"""The data-dir reaper must not delete a cluster that is serving.

``_reap_stale_pg_data_dirs`` removes throwaway PostgreSQL data dirs left by
runs that ended without cleaning up. It is guarded twice: a directory is spared
if a postmaster pid file says a cluster is live, and separately if it was
touched recently. The conftest comment calls the age check "a belt to the
braces", meaning the pid file is supposed to be the real guard.

The brace was not fastened. The check tested ``<dir>/postmaster.pid`` while
``embedded_pg.boot`` puts the cluster in ``<dir>/pgdata`` and the postmaster
writes its pid file there, so the test matched nothing on any machine.
Measured on this tree before the fix: of the data dirs present, none carried a
pid file at the bare name and every one carried it under ``pgdata``. The guard
had therefore never fired once, and every live cluster older than the age cut
was one ``shutil.rmtree`` away from being deleted out from under the session
using it.

Nothing went red, because a guard that spares nothing looks exactly like a
guard with nothing to spare. The count it reports is the tell: it said zero
running clusters on a machine where every cluster was running.
