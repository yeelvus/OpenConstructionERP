// The honeycomb, in the product: one renderer, and the adapters that feed it.
//
// The public case pages have drawn this for a while: the modules a case walks
// through, as interlocking hexagons rather than another list of chips. The
// product had the honeycomb only as a shape it cut portraits to. This is the
// component itself.
//
// ONE COMB, TWO SUBJECTS. `Hive` below knows about hexagons and nothing else:
// cells, a band, a tint, an optional activation. `ModuleHive` adapts a case's
// modules to it (routes, icons from the route map); `CaseCompanyHive` in
// CompanyHive.tsx adapts the kinds of company a case is written for. A second
// comb copied for the second subject would have drifted from this one within a
// release - the two are the same drawing with different cargo, so only the
// cargo differs here.
//
// WHAT IT SAYS. One cell per thing the case actually declares, in the order
// the case reaches them, named with the same words the rest of the page uses.
// The hive is CONTENT: it is the only place a reader can see the whole span of
// a case at once, so the names are real text in the accessible tree and only
// the drawing around them is hidden from it.
//
// WHAT IT DOES NOT SAY. The public pages surround a case's modules with ghost
// cells for "the platform's other modules" and print "6 of 117". We do not.
// There is no module census in this tree to count against - the sidebar
// catalogue is nav rows behind role and mode gating, not a list of modules -
// so any denominator here would be a number somebody chose. The count of a
// case's own modules is a fact; the fraction would be decoration wearing the
// costume of one. Company types are a closed union and DO have a census, but
// it buys a number for the caption, not a comb of greyed-out cells: a cell
// nobody can act on reads as disabled, which is a worse answer than absent.
