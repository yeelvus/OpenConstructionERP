# Modules - Guide and Catalog

How to build, install, and publish modules for OpenConstructionERP, plus a
map of every module that ships in the box.

OpenConstructionERP is modular by design: every business feature (BOQ, BIM,
takeoff, schedule, CDE, regional BOQ packs and more) is a self-contained
module that can be enabled, disabled, installed, or replaced without touching
the core. The current build loads 180+ modules. You enable only the parts you
need.

This file is the single entry point. Deeper material lives alongside the code
it describes, and the links point there.

---

## 1. The module catalog

All 185 modules that load in the current build, grouped by what they do for a
construction team. The bold name is the module's display name; the code label
is its backend folder under `backend/app/modules/`.

Jump to a group:

Note: each manifest also carries a `category` tag (core, business, extension,
enterprise, integration, regional, infra, controls). That tag is a packaging
label used by the loader. The groups below are by function, so a module's
group here will not always equal its manifest `category`.

### Estimating and BOQ

Build and price the bill of quantities.

- **Bill of Quantities** `boq` - core hierarchical BOQ editor with positions, quantities and cost roll-up.
- **Assemblies & Calculations** `assemblies` - composite rates built from cost-database items with factors and regional adjustment.

## 2. What is a module?

A module is a self-contained unit that may contribute any of:

| Surface       | Where it lives                                  | Registered by            |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| REST routes   | `backend/app/modules/<name>/router.py`          | `manifest.py`            |
| DB models     | `backend/app/modules/<name>/models.py`          | auto-discovered          |
| Business code | `backend/app/modules/<name>/service.py`         | imported from router     |
| UI pages      | `frontend/src/modules/<name>/manifest.ts`       | `_registry.ts`           |
| i18n strings  | `manifest.ts` + `i18n-fallbacks.ts`             | runtime i18next          |
| Validation    | `backend/app/modules/<name>/validators.py`      | central validation engine |

A module that only adds UI (for example a regional BOQ exchange) can live purely
in `frontend/src/modules/`. A module that only adds API logic (for example a new
connector) can live purely in `backend/app/modules/`. Most full-stack features
have both.

---

## 3. Backend module, 5-minute walkthrough

**Start from the template**:

```bash
cp -r modules/oe-module-template backend/app/modules/my_module
```

Then edit `backend/app/modules/my_module/manifest.py`:

```python
from app.core.module_loader import ModuleManifest

manifest = ModuleManifest(
    name="oe_my_module",        # unique, snake_case, oe_ prefix
    version="0.1.0",
    display_name="My Module",
    description="One-line description",
    author="Your Name",
    category="business",         # e.g. core, business, extension, integration, regional, enterprise
    depends=["oe_projects"],     # other modules this needs
    auto_install=False,          # False = user enables it from /modules
    enabled=True,
)
```

**Minimum viable file set**:

```
backend/app/modules/my_module/
├── __init__.py
├── manifest.py          # REQUIRED, metadata
├── router.py            # FastAPI router, auto-mounted at /api/v1/my_module/*
├── models.py            # SQLAlchemy models (optional)
├── schemas.py           # Pydantic request/response models
├── service.py           # Business logic (stateless, sync or async)
└── tests/
```

**Router convention** (`router.py`):

```python
from fastapi import APIRouter

router = APIRouter(prefix="/my_module", tags=["my_module"])

@router.get("/")
async def list_items():
    return {"items": []}
```

The prefix is mounted under `/api/v1/`, so the endpoint becomes
`GET /api/v1/my_module/`. The module loader wires this automatically, with no
need to edit `main.py`.

**Migrations**: if you add models, put Alembic migrations under
`backend/app/modules/my_module/migrations/` and run `make migrate`.

**Validation rules**: drop a file under
`backend/app/core/validation/rules/my_module.py` that subclasses
`ValidationRule`. The engine auto-registers it.

Reference implementations: `backend/app/modules/boq/`, `backend/app/modules/projects/`.

## 4. Frontend module, 5-minute walkthrough

Full guide lives at:
**[`frontend/src/modules/MODULE_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md`](frontend/src/modules/MODULE_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md)**

**Short version**:

```bash
mkdir frontend/src/modules/my-feature
```

Create `frontend/src/modules/my-feature/manifest.ts`:

```ts
import { lazy } from 'react';
import { Sparkles } from 'lucide-react';
import type { ModuleManifest } from '../_types';

const MyFeatureModule = lazy(() => import('./MyFeatureModule'));

export const manifest: ModuleManifest = {
  id: 'my-feature',
  name: 'My Feature',
  description: 'What this module does in one line',
  version: '1.0.0',
  icon: Sparkles,
  category: 'tools',           // estimation | planning | procurement | tools
  defaultEnabled: false,
  depends: ['boq'],

  routes: [{ path: '/my-feature', title: 'My Feature', component: MyFeatureModule }],

  navItems: [{
    labelKey: 'nav.my_feature',
    to: '/my-feature',
    icon: Sparkles,
    group: 'tools',
    advancedOnly: true,
  }],
};
```

Then register in `frontend/src/modules/_registry.ts`:

```ts
import { manifest as myFeature } from './my-feature/manifest';
export const MODULE_REGISTRY = [/* ... */, myFeature];
```

All nav and routes appear automatically once registered.

---

## 5. Installing a third-party module

Two supported paths:

**Zip install** (recommended for distribution):

```bash
openconstructionerp module install path/to/my-module-1.0.0.zip
```

**Manual install** (development):

```bash
cp -r downloaded-module backend/app/modules/
# restart backend, the module loader picks it up
```

Then enable it from the UI: **Settings, Modules & Marketplace, System Modules**.

---

## 6. Core rules (enforced in PR review)

1. **i18n everywhere** - every user-visible string goes through `t()`. No
   hardcoded English. Fallbacks live in `frontend/src/app/i18n-fallbacks.ts`.
2. **No IfcOpenShell, no native IFC parsing** - CAD and BIM are always converted
   through DDC cad2data to the canonical JSON format. BCF is allowed as an open
   I/O format for issues, viewpoints and validation reports. See
   [`docs/adr/002-no-ifcopenshell-ddc-canonical-only.md`](docs/adr/002-no-ifcopenshell-ddc-canonical-only.md).
3. **Validation is not optional** - any module that ingests data must declare
   validation rules. See `backend/app/core/validation/`.
4. **Suggestions are confirmed by a person** - any suggested value must show a
   confidence score and require user confirmation before it mutates data.
5. **AGPL-3.0 compliance** - contributions are dual-licensed (AGPL plus
   Commercial). See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## 8. Notes for automated scaffolding and agents

If you scaffold a module on behalf of a user:

- Copy the template, do not start from scratch. The manifest contract changes
  faster than this doc.
- Read the module's `manifest.py` and any local `README` before modifying it.
- Run `npm run build` (frontend) and `ruff check` plus `pytest` (backend)
  before reporting the module done.
- Never edit the `frontend/src/modules/_types.ts` or `_registry.ts` contract.
  Only add to the registry array.
- If a module needs a new translation key, add the English fallback to
  `i18n-fallbacks.ts` in every locale block you touch. Never leave a raw
  English string in TSX code.
