/**
 * Resolving the name a backend module wears on screen.
 *
 * The module registry page used to render `display_name` straight from the
 * manifest, so all 185 module names showed in English to every reader in every
 * language. `ModuleManifest` did carry a `display_name_i18n` dict and the page
 * did declare it in its type, but nothing ever read it, which is why no gate
 * could see the hole: from the model side the field exists, and from the page
 * side the type says it exists.
 *
 * There are two legitimate sources and they cover different modules, so both
 * stay, in a fixed order:
 *
 *   1. `modules.catalog.<name>` in the locale files. This is where a bundled
 *      module's name belongs, because the locale files are the only place the
 *      existing i18n gates can see a string at all.
 *   2. `display_name_i18n` from the manifest. A module installed at runtime by
 *      the module builder cannot add keys to a compiled locale bundle, so for
 *      those modules this dict is the only translation path there is.
 *   3. `display_name`, the English wording, as the last resort.
 *
 * Note the order is by *quality of the answer*, not by source: a curated locale
 * value beats a hand-written manifest entry, but an English fallback does not.
 * That distinction is why this asks whether translation actually happened
 * rather than whether a key exists. `i18n.exists()` answers the second
 * question, and it returns true for a key present only in English, which would
 * let an English fallback shadow a manifest translation that is genuinely
 * better.
