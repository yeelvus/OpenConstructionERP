"""Read the bundled third-party licence texts from the running product.

    GET /api/v1/licenses/        - PUBLIC. Every licence text in this build.
    GET /api/v1/licenses/{name}  - PUBLIC. One text in full.

The texts are the ones :mod:`app.core.license_texts` locates: LGPL-3.0 and
LGPL-2.1 for the libraries NOTICE lists, GPL-3.0 because LGPL-3.0 is written as
additional permissions on top of it, and the OpenSSL, SSLeay, HarfBuzz and
PostgreSQL texts for native binaries arriving inside other packages' wheels.
They have shipped inside every artefact for the life of the product with
nothing in the backend able to read them, so the only way to see one was to go
to gnu.org. On a desktop install with no network that is a link to nothing, and
that is the deployment where somebody is most likely to be looking.

Public on purpose, and it is the same reasoning as ``branding_router``: these
are published documents that anyone may read, they carry nothing about this
workspace, and a licence you have to sign in to read is not much better than a
licence behind a dead link.

Two states, told apart deliberately, because collapsing them is the failure
this endpoint is most likely to ship with:

* ``404`` - this build has no licence by that name. An ordinary answer.
* ``503`` - the directory itself could not be located, so we cannot say what
  this build carries. Answering 404 here would tell a reader "there is no such
  licence" when the truth is "this install is broken", and the reader most
  affected is the one checking compliance.

The listing answers with an envelope rather than a bare array, so a later
addition of paging is not a breaking change for callers.
