// What to call a funding deadline on screen.
//
// A derived deadline is written by the server when an award is recorded, and
// its title is stored as a sentence in the language of whoever wrote the
// service. That sentence cannot be translated later, so a German municipality
// reading its own deadline list sees "Records may be destroyed" in the middle
// of a page that is otherwise entirely German. The stored title is therefore
// treated as an internal label, and the screen reads the kind instead, which
// is an enum and is translated in every locale.
//
// A deadline someone typed themselves is different: those are their words,
// not the server's, and translating them would be losing what they wrote.

import type { useTranslation } from 'react-i18next';

import type { FundingDisbursement, FundingObligation } from './api';

type Translate = ReturnType<typeof useTranslation>['t'];

type LabelledObligation = Pick<FundingObligation, 'kind' | 'title' | 'source' | 'due_on'> &
  Partial<Pick<FundingObligation, 'title_key'>>;

/**
 * The name of a deadline in the reader's language.
 *
 * `draws` is optional and only changes the spend-window case: several draws
 * on one award each start their own spend window, and without the reference
 * the list shows two rows with the same name and different dates. They are
 * matched on the deadline the receipt stamped onto the draw, which is the
 * same date the obligation was created with.
 *
 * That match is not a key. Two draws received on the same day under the same
 * terms land on the same deadline, and then no reference is shown at all,
 * because a row labelled with the wrong draw is worse than a row labelled
 * with none: the date is still there to tell them apart, and a confident
 * wrong answer is not.
