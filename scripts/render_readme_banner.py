"""Render the README banner: who the platform is for, and how much of it there is.

Two honeycombs, one above the other and drawn to the same margins so they read as
one field seen at two scales. The upper comb is the cast the Cases hub is built
around, eight company types and fifteen professional roles, each cell a
photograph. The lower comb is every package under `backend/app/modules`, one cell
each, coloured by the category its own manifest declares and shaded by how many
of the others it is wired to.

Nothing in the picture is typed in by hand. Four sources are read:

    frontend/src/features/cases/companyTypes.ts   COMPANY_TYPE_META  (8 entries)
    frontend/src/features/cases/roles.ts          ROLE_META          (15 entries)
    frontend/public/assets/people/                the photographs
    backend/app/modules/*/manifest.py             one per module

so a role added to the product or a module added to the tree shows up on the next
run of this script rather than on the next time somebody remembers it exists.

The cells touch. A hexagon row whose neighbours sit a full row height apart is a
line of separate tiles that happen to be six sided, and an earlier banner drew
exactly that: the triangular notches above and below every cell stayed open and
the picture read as a chain. Pointy top hexagons share edges at one spacing only,
a row step of three quarters of the cell height with every other row inset by half
a cell width, and that is the spacing here. It costs the strip under each cell
where the captions used to sit, so the captions moved inside, into the band
between half height and three quarter height, which is the only part of a pointy
top hexagon still at its full width.

Two module graphs are counted, because they answer different questions and the
gap between them is worth seeing: the `depends` lists in the manifests, which is
what the loader topologically sorts on, and the imports, which is where the
coupling really is. Imports are found with a line anchored regular expression
rather than with `ast` on purpose, because parts of the backend use PEP 695
syntax that only a 3.12 parser accepts and this script should render on whatever
interpreter is at hand. The expression was checked against a full `ast` walk over
the 2120 files a 3.12 parser does accept and the two agree exactly, 704 directed
pairs either way.

The title is not in the picture. It lives in the README above the image, where it
is selectable, searchable and readable by a screen reader.

Usage:

    python scripts/render_readme_banner.py

Requires Pillow, which is already a backend dependency. No browser, no Node.

# category of one would give six specks equal billing with a hundred and nineteen
# modules.
#
# Respaced twice. An early set picked against white mixed a 216 blue with a 148
# teal and a 158 grey, three different luminances doing the same job, and the
# comb read as a rainbow rather than as a sorted field; the dark set that
# replaced it put all seven at one chroma and one luminance band. That band was
# chosen to sit on black, and every one of those swatches is a shade too light
# to hold on paper, so the rule is kept and the band is moved: still one chroma
# and one weight, still far enough apart in hue to count, a step deeper.
#
# The last two are the pair to watch. Enterprise and Other are both greys, three
# modules and nine, and on the dark ground they were four points of luminance
# apart, which is not a difference a reader can use in a legend. Enterprise is
