"""i18n nesting guard: block a locale key that is a sibling of the dictionary.

Every locale file is one object with one member:

    const resource = {
      "translation": {
        "boq.title": "Bill of quantities",
        ...
      }
    } as { translation: Record<string, string> };

`app/i18n.ts` hands i18next `resource.translation`, once per language through
`addResourceBundle(code, 'translation', resource.translation, ...)` and once
more for English through `resources: { en: enResource }`. Only the members of
that inner object are ever looked up. A key written one level higher, as a
sibling of `translation` rather than inside it, parses, type-checks, builds and
is never found.

Nothing else we own can see it, and that is the point of this guard:

  * the orphan guard reads locale files with a line regex and asks whether a
    key appears at all, not where it appears, so a sibling reads as present
  * the leak, escape and mixed-script guards ask about the value, and the
    value is a correct translation
  * `tsc` and the build are satisfied, because the file is a valid object
    literal either way, and the trailing `as` assertion is not a check
  * a screen looks normal, because every call site passes the English as
    `defaultValue`, so a failed lookup renders English rather than a raw key

That combination is the worst case. Thirty translated files, six thousand
keys, every gate green, every language showing English. It shipped that way
once already: the keys for three statutory modules went in after
`const resource = {` instead of after `"translation": {`, and the difference
is two lines of context in a file of thirty six thousand.

So the question here is only about position, and the answer is absolute rather
than baselined. There is no such thing as a legitimate sibling key, and a
baseline would only record how many were wrong on the day it was written.
