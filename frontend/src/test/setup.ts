// tests failing by exactly the host's offset while every other test passes,
// which reads like a bug in the code under test rather than in how the run was
// invoked. Measured on this repo at +0200: default pool 39 passed, the same
// file under `--pool=threads` 5 failed, and `TZ=UTC` in the environment before
// node starts made those 5 pass again.
//
// So say it out loud instead of letting five assertions imply it. Anyone who
// reaches for `--pool=threads` as a load workaround gets one sentence naming
// the cause rather than a date arithmetic mystery.

// Cancel timers that would otherwise outlive the jsdom environment.
//
// When a test file finishes, vitest deletes the jsdom globals. A timer armed
// during that file is a plain Node timer and is NOT deleted with them, so it
// still fires afterwards, into a world where `window` no longer exists. AG
// Grid arms exactly such a timer: `sizeColumnsToFit` retries on a 0/100/500 ms
// chain while the grid measures 0 px wide. Stubbing layout does not settle it -
// both grid tests that stub `clientWidth` still drove ag-grid to its zero-width
// warning on CI, because the retry lands once `cleanup()` has detached the
// element and the stubbed getters no longer describe an attached box. The
// 500 ms link lands after teardown, reaches React's `getCurrentEventPriority`,
// which reads `window`, and the run dies with `ReferenceError: window is not
// defined` raised outside any test. vitest counts no failed test and still
// exits 1, so the summary reads 634 files / 7271 passed above a red exit code.
//
// Unmounting does not help: measured on BOQGrid, the retry survives
// `cleanup()` untouched, because ag-grid armed it and nothing in the React
// tree owns it. Whether it also becomes visible is a race the worker usually
// wins by exiting first, which is why this reddens ubuntu and not macOS or
// Windows, and why it lands on commits that touch only backend files.
//
// So track what a file arms and cancel whatever is still pending once its last
// test has run. Inside a file nothing changes: timers keep working normally,
// and only the ones that would have crossed the teardown boundary are dropped.
