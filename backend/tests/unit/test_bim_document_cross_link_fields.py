"""A cross-link has to be built out of fields the model it writes actually has.

``_generate_pdf_in_background`` passed ``created_by`` to ``Document``, which has
no such column - ``Base`` carries id, created_at and updated_at and nothing
else. SQLAlchemy's declarative constructor answers an unknown keyword with
``TypeError``, so the row was never attempted, let alone written. The block sat
under ``except Exception`` and logged "PDF sheets -> Document linkage failed",
wording that reads like the database refusing a row. It had refused nothing. The
sheets PDF of every converted model has been missing from the documents hub for
as long as the code has existed, and the only trace was a log line that pointed
at the wrong half of the system.

This is checked by walking the router's syntax rather than by exercising the
path, on purpose. ``_generate_pdf_in_background`` returns early unless a
converter binary is installed, so no test that can run on a clean machine ever
reaches the constructor - which is exactly why the defect survived. Reading the
call sites out of the AST also means a cross-link added later is covered the day
it is written, and it covers the ones whose keyword values are variables, which
a grep for a call shape cannot see.

Sibling guard to ``tests/modules/bim_hub/test_cad_upload_cross_link.py``,
which covers the other half of the same lesson on the one cross-link a test can
execute: what a write that fails for real does to the session around it.
