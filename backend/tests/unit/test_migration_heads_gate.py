"""The single-head gate sees a fork that no single author can see.

Three revisions were added in parallel and two chained off the same parent.
Each author ran ``alembic heads`` inside their own task, each saw one head, and
each was telling the truth: they ran before the others had written a file. The
fork existed only in the union.

The parser is the part worth testing rather than the arithmetic. The first
draft read ``down_revision`` with a single-line regex and lost the parents of
every merge revision written as a multi-line tuple, which turned 39 merges into
39 orphans and reported 43 heads over a tree that had one. So the tuple cases
are here as fixtures, both shapes.
