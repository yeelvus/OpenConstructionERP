"""Every seeded resource buildup must add up to the position's own unit rate.

The BOQ grid derives its resource columns by summing ``quantity * unit_rate``
over a position's leaves: the labour / material / plant columns on the German
preset, the equivalent cost-element columns on the Chinese one. When the leaves
do not add up to the rate beside them the columns are wrong in a way nobody can
see, because each column on its own still looks plausible.

Both readings are asserted, because the two consumers do not read the same
field. The grid computes from ``quantity * unit_rate`` and never looks at a
leaf's ``total`` (``columnDefs.ts``), while ``_resource_breakdown_rollup``
prefers ``total``. Pinning only one would leave two nearly-equal truths in the
data and let them drift apart again.

The population is every position of every registered demo template rather than
a sample, and that is the point of the test. The defect it pins was a rounding
effect that only bit where the unit rate was small: a labour share of a rate
under one unit of currency divided by an hourly crew rate rounded to zero
hours, so the leaf carried no money and the grid showed a position as pure
material with no crew time on it. A sample would have missed it, and the money
identity would have gone on failing quietly on hundreds of rows.

Scope. This covers ``_make_resources``, the buildup behind
``_enrich_position_metadata`` that every demo template goes through. The
separate ``_resources_for_position`` helper has its own remainder logic and a
single call site and is not exercised here.
