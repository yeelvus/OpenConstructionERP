"""Serve frontend static files from the installed package or dev build.

# What an operator is told when a UI path cannot be served because there is no
# bundle to serve it from. Two different states, and the answer says which,
# because the way out differs: one is fixed before the next start, the other is
# a build that went missing under a server that is otherwise healthy.
#
# A bare 404 on every path of a running server is its own kind of confusing - it
# reads as "wrong URL" when the truth is "this deployment has no UI in it" - so
# the body names the deployment problem. Deliberately plain text in a JSON
# envelope and not a styled page: the reader is whoever is looking at a curl or
# a browser's network tab during a failed deploy.
