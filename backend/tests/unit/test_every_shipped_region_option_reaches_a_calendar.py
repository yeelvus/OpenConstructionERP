"""Every region the product offers must reach a working week someone chose for it.

**The defect this file exists to prevent, and why the previous gate missed it.**

``schedule.service.get_work_calendar`` resolves a region string to a planning
week. The region strings it is actually handed come from ``project.region``,
which is written by the project region picker in
``frontend/src/features/projects/CreateProjectPage.tsx``.

The gate that already covers this resolver,
``test_work_calendar_rest_days_do_not_conflict.py``, walks
``_CALENDAR_BY_COUNTRY`` and ``core.calendar._WORKING_WEEK``. Both are keyed by
ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country codes. The picker emits none: it ships compound
CamelCase tokens like ``GulfStates`` and ``MiddleEast``. So the instrument and
the product spoke different vocabularies, every assertion passed, and a user who
picked "Gulf States" for a Doha project was silently given a Monday-Friday week
in a country whose statutory rest day is Friday.

Twenty-one of the thirty shipped options resolved to ``DEFAULT``. The resolver
was never wrong about the vocabulary it was asked about; it was never asked
about the one the product speaks.

**Therefore the population here is read from the picker file itself.** Copying
the values into this module would rebuild exactly the blind spot above: the copy
and the picker would drift, and the drift would be invisible because both sides
would still be internally consistent. The parse is cross-checked two independent
ways below, because a parse that silently matches nothing is a green gate over
an empty population, which is the same failure wearing a different hat.

**What this file asserts, and what it deliberately does not.**

It asserts that every shipped option is *classified*: it either resolves to a
calendar chosen for it, or it is named in one of the two tables below with a
reason. It cannot assert that the classification is *right*. Adding a picker
option ``Egypt`` together with a Monday-Friday ``EGYPT`` calendar would pass here
and still be wrong, because Egypt works Sunday-Thursday. Judging whether a week
matches a country is what the rest-days gate does, against a sourced country
week. This file closes the gap where nobody asked the question at all.
