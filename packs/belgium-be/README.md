# Belgium Construction Pack

Configures OpenConstructionERP for the Belgian construction market. Belgium is
a bilingual market where specifications and bills are written in Dutch (bestek /
meetstaat) in Flanders and French (cahier des charges / metrage) in Wallonia,
with Brussels using both. The pack defaults to Dutch and supports both languages
in onboarding and project descriptions. Currency is EUR with 21% BTW/TVA on
new-build and 6% on renovation.

## What makes a Belgian estimate Belgian

A Belgian meetstaat (bill of quantities) is element-based, commonly following
the BB/SfB classification, and structured as a detailed specification (bestek)
with measured quantities and unit rates. Public procurement follows federal
law (Wet Overheidsopdrachten / Loi Marches Publics) and requires a bestek
conforming to the standard template.

Two VAT rates matter for construction. New-build work carries the standard 21
percent. Renovation of a dwelling older than ten years carries the reduced 6
percent rate, and the distinction between the two is a significant part of
project economics. The pack sets the `be_btw_21` tax template for new-build.

Energy performance is regulated through the EPB/PEB framework, and structural
design follows the NBN EN Eurocodes (Belgian adoption).

## What this pack enables

- **Currency EUR** with the `be_btw_21` tax template and the `belgium`
  estimating methodology, defaulting to Dutch with French support
- **DIN 276 rule set** for classification validation, as the nearest supported
  hierarchy Belgian element-based bills map onto
- **Two demo projects**: an office building in Brussels and a residential
  development in Antwerp, both priced at Belgian 2026 market rates in EUR
  excluding BTW/TVA
- **BB/SfB, EPB/PEB and public procurement regulatory references** in the
  pack metadata
