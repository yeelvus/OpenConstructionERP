"""The coverage audit measures a regional variant against its base language.

en-US, es-MX, es-CL, es-CO and pt-BR carry only the words that differ from en,
es and pt. Every other key is answered by the base file, and a reader of the
variant sees their own language. scripts/audit_i18n_coverage.py used to compare
all 43 locale files against en.ts, so it reported the one deliberate overlay we
own as 33643 keys short and printed RED beside it. That line is an instruction
to destroy the overlay: the cheapest way to make it go away is to paste a full
copy of English into en-US.ts, which is exactly what the orphan guard's own
history warns about.

Both directions are asserted here, because the cheap way to stop printing the
false line is to stop looking at variants at all, and that tool would be just
as wrong. A variant covered by its base must be clean, a base that is genuinely
missing a key must still be caught in the base AND in the variant riding on it,
and a language that is nobody's variant must stay measured against English.
