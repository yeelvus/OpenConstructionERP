/**
 * Canonical money primitives for the Decimal-as-string backend contract.
 *
 * The backend serialises every monetary value as a JSON *string* (a
 * `decimal.Decimal` rendered verbatim, e.g. `"1234.56"`) so large totals
 * round-trip without float precision loss and stay locale-neutral. The
 * TypeScript response types frequently declare these fields as `number`,
 * which is a lie: at runtime they arrive as strings. Calling `.toFixed()`
 * on that string throws (`"…".toFixed is not a function`), and a binary
 * `+` concatenates instead of adding. That mismatch is the single most
 * common money bug in this codebase (hundreds of historical `.toFixed`
 * crash sites).
 *
 * `toNum` is the one safe coercion primitive: it accepts whatever the wire
 * actually delivers (string | number | null | undefined), and never returns
 * `NaN`/`Infinity` - those degrade to `0` so downstream arithmetic and
 * `Intl.NumberFormat` can never blow up or render "NaN".
 *
 * `formatCurrency` is the locale-aware display formatter built on top of it.
 * Unlike a naive formatter it never hard-falls-back to EUR: rendering a
 * USD/BRL/JPY amount with a Euro sign actively misinforms the operator, so
 * an unknown/blank currency yields a plain grouped number with no symbol.

// newly obeyed here.

 * whose authority is ISO 4217 and not the locale of whoever is looking, and
 * nothing on a screen is one of those. That half is written down where a
