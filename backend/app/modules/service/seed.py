"""Demo-data seeder for the Service & Maintenance module.

Function ``seed_service_demo(session, project_ids)`` populates:
    - 3 SLA definitions (gold / silver / bronze)
    - one service contract per demo project, cycling a list of fictional customers
    - 80 customer assets distributed across the contracts
    - 30 open tickets (mix of priorities + assignments)
    - 200 historical work orders in ``billed`` state with line items
    - 20 active PPM schedules

Contracts are the module's only project-scoped row. Tickets, work orders and
assets reach a project through their contract, so a contract with no project
takes everything under it out of the per-project view as well.

Ticket timing is drawn against each contract's own SLA tier rather than a
fixed window, so the estate reports a believable spread of met, near-miss and
breached rather than a uniform 100% breach. See :data:`_SLA_OUTCOME_MIX`.

Idempotent only at the *no-existing-rows* level: if any contract already
exists for the seeded customer ids the function returns early.

Never auto-executed - call it explicitly from a CLI / Alembic data-only
migration if you want the demo data.
