"""The two reindex endpoints that are NOT built by ``create_vector_routes``.

Six modules mount their vector routes from the factory, so bounding the factory
bounded six of the platform's eight reindex paths at once. The other two are
hand-written, for a reason that is not going away: each carries a permission
gate the factory has no vocabulary for (BOQ ownership, BIM model access) and a
second filter of its own (``boq_id``, ``model_id``). They were left reading
their whole table into one list.

They are the two paths where that costs most. Per-row the rows are light -
measured on this tree with tracemalloc, 2.65 KiB for a position and 3.12 KiB
for an element, against 29.71 KiB for the heaviest factory row - but weight per
row is not the exposure here, count is. A converted model contributes its
entire element set to one table and an imported BOQ its entire position set, so
these are the two collections that plausibly reach seven figures, where 2.65
KiB a row is 2.5 GiB held at once on a platform whose stated floor is a 3 GB
server that also runs PostgreSQL.

Both now hand their statement to ``reindex_statement_in_pages``, the same walk
the factory uses, so what is asserted below is asserted of one implementation
through two doors. The gate tests are here for the same reason: the rewiring
moved the read, and the read sits underneath a security check that must still
happen first.

No database is involved: the session is a recorder that serves the pages the
statement asks for and holds them until they are expunged, and the embedding
side is a recorder that counts what it was handed.
