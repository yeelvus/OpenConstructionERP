"""Every seeded working week must mean the same week the schedule resolver means.

The platform holds two weekday conventions at once, on purpose.
``oe_i18n_work_calendar.work_days`` counts Monday = 1 through Sunday = 7,
matching ``date.isoweekday()``, which is what
:func:`~app.modules.i18n_foundation.service.get_working_days` counts each date
with. ``schedule.WORK_CALENDARS`` and ``core.calendar._WORKING_WEEK`` count
Monday = 0 through Sunday = 6, matching ``date.weekday()``. Both are correct and
neither is going away; what is missing is anything that makes them agree.

Nothing converts at a boundary today, because the two never meet: no reader of
the seeded column is on the Monday-zero axis. That is what makes this worth a
gate rather than a fix. The failure mode is not a conversion going wrong, it is
a *week being written on the wrong axis in the first place*, and this table has
already shipped that once - Saudi Arabia went out as a four-day week and needed
migration ``v3303`` to repair it.

A range check cannot catch it. ``[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`` for Saudi Arabia is five legal
ISO weekdays and the wrong week. Only Sunday and Friday tell the axes apart, so
the check has to be against something that already knows what each country's
week means, which is what the Monday-zero tables are.

This gate asserts weeks. It does not assert hours, and that gap is deliberate
rather than overlooked: ``work_hours_per_day`` disagrees with
``schedule.WORK_CALENDARS`` on five seeded rows - CH at 8.4, AU at 7.6, NO and
FI at 7.5, DK at 7.4 - and none of those is an axis question. Reading a green
run here as "the two calendar systems agree" would be reading more than it says.
