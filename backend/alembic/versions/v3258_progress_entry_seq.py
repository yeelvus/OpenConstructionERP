"""Add a monotonic ``seq`` to ``oe_progress_entry`` so "latest wins" is well defined.

Progress entries are append-only: a mistake is corrected by recording a new
entry, and the reading that counts is the latest one. That rule had no reliable
ordering key behind it.

``recorded_at`` defaults to ``now()``, and in PostgreSQL ``now()`` is the
TRANSACTION timestamp - every row written by one transaction carries exactly the
same value, by design rather than by coincidence. ``created_at`` is a per-row
Python ``datetime.now()`` whose granularity is about 1 ms on Windows against
about 1 ns on Linux, so on a coarse clock rows inserted in one flush share it
too. With both tied the winner fell through to the primary key, a random uuid4.
The ordering was stable but arbitrary: a re-imported corrections file, where
every row lands in one transaction, picked its winner by uuid sort. The old
MAX(percent_complete) rule at least failed predictably (always the most
optimistic reading); ordering by uuid trades that for a coin toss.

``seq`` is assigned by the database on INSERT and strictly increases, which is
the only thing in the table that can order rows written inside one transaction.

Two alternatives were considered and rejected, because they are what the next
person will reach for:

* ``ctid`` - the physical row location. Monotonic for plain appends, but VACUUM
  FULL, pg_repack and any UPDATE rewrite it, so an ordering built on it changes
  under maintenance that is supposed to be invisible.
* ``xmin`` - the inserting transaction id. Identical for every row written by
  one transaction, which is precisely the case this column exists to resolve,
  and it wraps around.

Backfill is explicit and deterministic: existing rows are numbered by
``recorded_at, created_at, id``, the best order the historical data can still be
said to have, so the sequence agrees with it rather than with physical layout.
The identity sequence then restarts above the highest backfilled value.

Inspector-guarded so re-running on an already-migrated DB is a no-op.
