"""Public funding API routes - mounted at /api/v1/funding/.

Two scoping rules run through every endpoint here and are worth stating once
rather than repeating in thirty docstrings.

Anything that names a project verifies access to that project before it
reads. Anything that names a child record loads its application first and
verifies access to *that* application's project, never to a project id the
caller supplied, because a caller who may name the project can name one they
are entitled to and then ask for a record belonging to one they are not.

``today`` is a query parameter rather than the server's clock. Whether a
deadline has passed is a question about the reader's calendar, and a server
in another timezone would answer it differently for the same person on the
same afternoon. Callers that omit it get the counts without the lateness.
