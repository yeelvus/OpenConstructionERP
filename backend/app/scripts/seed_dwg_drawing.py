"""Seed an already-converted demo DXF drawing for the DWG Takeoff module.

Why this exists
---------------
Demo DWG drawings used to be seeded as metadata-only rows (``status="uploaded"``,
``file_path=""``, no parsed entities). On a fresh install the local DDC cad2data
DWG converter is absent, so nothing transitioned those rows and the
``/dwg-takeoff`` viewer span forever on a "Converting your drawing..." spinner.

DWG is an open format we open directly, and DXF parses out of the box via
``ezdxf`` (a base dependency). So instead of a stuck reference row, the demo now
seeds a small but real DXF floor-plan, parses it through the same code path an
upload uses, and persists a ``ready`` version with entities on disk. A first-time
user opens ``/dwg-takeoff`` and sees a working drawing immediately - no converter,
no spinner.

The helper is fully idempotent: it keys the drawing on a deterministic id and
skips when a ready version already exists, so re-running a seeder (every boot)
is a cheap no-op.

    Uses ``ezdxf`` (a base dependency) to author a tidy little plan: an outer
    room rectangle, an interior partition, a door swing arc, a window, and a
    room label per side - enough that the viewer has real geometry to render
    and the layer panel shows named layers. Units are set to millimetres
    (``$INSUNITS = 4``) so the drawing reads at a realistic building scale.

    The plan is presented as a German Grundriss, so the labels are written the
    way a German plan writes them (see the room labels below). Layer names stay
    on the AIA ``DISCIPLINE-MAJOR-MINOR`` codes, which are a drafting standard
    rather than prose and are what the match extractors classify on.

    Creates a ``DwgDrawing`` (format ``dxf``, status ``ready``) plus a parsed
    ``DwgDrawingVersion`` whose entities are written to the same on-disk store
    a real upload uses, so ``GET /drawings/{id}/entities`` serves them and the
    viewer renders immediately on a fresh install.

    The ``element_count`` written to the drawing's metadata is the count the
    parse returned for the DXF authored here, and nothing else. Callers used to
    pass a count in, and both passed the one belonging to the converted CAD
    model of the same format in the demo spec - a different, far larger file -
    so the drawing advertised thousands of elements and served eight. A count
    is only ever true of one file, so this one is taken from the file it
    describes and the parameter is gone.

    Idempotent: returns early if the drawing already has a ready version, and
    regenerates the DXF + entities only when missing (e.g. a half-seeded row
    from a previous failure, or a data-dir that was wiped).

    Returns ``True`` when a ready (or at least listed) drawing exists
    afterwards, ``False`` only when even the metadata row could not be created.
    Falls back to a metadata-only ``uploaded`` row when ezdxf or the parse is
    unavailable - the backend then reports ``needs_conversion`` so the UI shows
    the friendly convert state rather than a spinner.
