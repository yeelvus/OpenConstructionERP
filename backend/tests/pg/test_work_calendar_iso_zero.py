"""The ISO-zero repair against the row it exists for and the row it must not touch.

The headline number is the one to read first. Saudi Arabia stored as
``[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`` counts four working days in the week of 4 January 2026,
because ``isoweekday()`` returns 1..7 and the 0 matches nothing at all. Stored
as ``[7, 1, 2, 3, 4]`` it counts five. That is the defect: not a refusal, not an
error in a log, a working week quietly one day short for every schedule drawn in
the country.

The other half is the four-day Monday-to-Thursday week. It is unusual, it is
entirely legal on this axis, and a repair that could not tell it apart from a
week written on the wrong axis would be rewriting somebody's deliberate
configuration on every boot. That case is asserted here rather than reasoned
about, because it is the one that decides whether this repair is safe to ship.
