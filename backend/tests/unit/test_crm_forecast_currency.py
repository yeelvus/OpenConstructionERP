"""crm: the forecast's currency breakdown survives being stored.

``compute_forecast`` has always returned ``by_currency`` and
``mixed_currency`` alongside its four scalars. They were computed correctly
and then dropped on the way to the ``Forecast`` row, and ``ForecastResponse``
declared defaults - ``[]`` and ``False`` - that filled the gap back in. The
result was not an error anywhere: ``GET /forecasts/{period}`` and
``POST /forecasts/compute`` answered ``mixed_currency: false`` on every call,
for every period, whatever the deals said.

The control is in the same module and gets it right
---------------------------------------------------
``GET /pipeline/metrics`` publishes the same two fields off the same helper
family, and ``PipelineMetricsResponse`` declares the *same* permissive
defaults. It has never been wrong, because it computes and constructs in one
breath with every field passed explicitly, so its defaults are never reached.

Two endpoints do reach them, by different routes. The forecast computes,
stores, and validates back off a row that had nowhere to keep the two fields.
``GET /crm/dashboard`` has no storage hop at all and simply passed seven of ten
arguments, so the remaining three came from the defaults on every call.

So the defaults are not the difference and the computation is not the
difference. Anything standing between the computation and the response is,
whether that is a missing column or a missing argument, and that is what these
tests hold in place: the control's correctness (which must not quietly become
the fix), both carry-throughs, and the refusal to manufacture an answer for a
row that was never checked.
