# DDC-CWICR-OE: DataDrivenConstruction - OpenConstructionERP
"""A socket that cannot judge your token must not say your token was bad.

Both WebSocket handlers used to answer every authentication problem with a
1008 policy close and the reason "unauthenticated". Measured against the real
handlers, every failure those clauses were written for - a malformed, expired
or wrong-type token, a subject that is not a UUID, a user who does not exist
or is inactive - already arrives as an ``HTTPException`` and is answered on
the narrow path. What was left reaching the broad clauses was never an
authentication failure at all: the database being unreachable, or a settings
object that cannot produce a secret. Those were reported to the client as
rejected credentials, which is the one answer that is certainly false.

Why it is worth a close code rather than a log line. Neither frontend client
reconnects, so in this product a socket that closes stays closed. A momentary
database fault did not degrade presence or notifications, it ended them, and
nothing came back when the database did. The user saw an empty roster and no
notifications, with nothing on screen suggesting anything had gone wrong.

Both directions, and that is not symmetry for its own sake. A test that only
asserts 1011 on an outage passes just as happily against a handler that has
been broken into answering 1011 for a genuinely rejected user, which is the
same defect with the polarity reversed and a worse one to debug: it tells a
person with a stale token that the server is broken.
