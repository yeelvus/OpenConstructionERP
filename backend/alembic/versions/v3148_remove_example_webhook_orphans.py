"""Remove stale "Example webhook (disabled)" seed rows that 404 in the UI.

The original gapfill seed on 2026-05-16 dropped one
``Example webhook (disabled)`` row per project into ``oe_integrations_config``
so the empty Integrations page would not look broken on demo installs.
The rows themselves are harmless (``is_active = false``, empty URL), but
the /integrations UI exposes "Test" / edit actions on every row that
404 because the rows do not point at a real webhook configuration —
they were never meant to be interactive. This migration removes them on
every existing install so the cleanup ships with v5.5.2.
