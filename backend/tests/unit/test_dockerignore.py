"""``.dockerignore`` coverage tests (BUG-B06 fix).

Without a ``.dockerignore`` every ``docker build`` ships ~2 GB of
context to the build daemon: the local SQLite DB (1 GB), customer BIM
uploads, the marketing site, every test artefact, and — most
dangerously — every ``.env`` file in the tree. That risks leaking
secrets and customer data into published images.

Docker's ignore-file semantics match ``gitignore`` (shipped via the
moby/patternmatcher library); the ``pathspec`` package implements the
same grammar. These tests parse both ``.dockerignore`` files in the
repo, then assert that the *interesting* paths — secrets, large data,
local databases — are excluded, while the paths the Dockerfiles
explicitly need (source code, ``pyproject.toml``, etc.) survive.

If a future contributor weakens these excludes, the test fails —
this is the intent: the cost of an accidentally-published secret is
much higher than a noisy test.
