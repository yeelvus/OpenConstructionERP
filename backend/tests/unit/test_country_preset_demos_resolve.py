"""Every onboarding Country Pack preset must name a demo the backend can install.

The preset table lives in the frontend and the demo registry lives here, so
nothing in either language could see both halves at once. What filled the gap
was a comment, and the comment was wrong: it said the flagship demos under
``demo_packs/`` "only register when their partner pack is installed", so preset
after preset was written with ``demoId: null`` to stay on the safe side.

``demo_projects`` imports ``app.core.demo_packs`` unconditionally at the bottom
of the module and the loader merges every pack file into ``DEMO_TEMPLATES`` at
import time. There is no condition anywhere. Sixteen of the twenty-one markets
shipped without an example project because of a sentence, while the demo they
needed was in the registry the whole time.

So this reads the shipped preset table off disk and asks the real registry. It
fails in both directions on purpose: a preset naming a demo that does not exist
is the obvious defect, and a preset naming no demo at all is the one that
actually happened.
