"""The notice engine counts working days when a standard says working days.

Every notice period configured today is a calendar-day period, so a bare
integer has been the right answer by coincidence rather than by design. These
tests pin the two halves of that: that a period declared in working days is
genuinely counted differently, and that every existing period still lands on
the day it always did.

The first half needs its own negative control. A suite in which both bases
always agree cannot tell a working basis from an ignored one, so one test
asserts a difference and a specific size for it, and another asserts that the
same two bases agree on a period that never leaves a working week.

No database and no app stack: the engine is pure, and the day arithmetic it now
delegates to imports nothing but the standard library.
