"""One Chinese fee name, one markup category, in every file that states one.

建标[2013]44号 describes a construction price along two axes that are
alternatives rather than layers. By cost element it is labour, material, plant,
the enterprise management fee, profit, statutory charges and tax. By price
formation it is bill items, preliminaries, other items, statutory charges and
tax. Under 清单计价 the management fee and profit sit inside the 综合单价, so on
a bill they describe how a unit rate is built; preliminaries and statutory
charges are heads beside the bill items and describe nothing about a rate.

That distinction is carried in this codebase by the markup ``category`` field,
and it is load-bearing rather than decorative. ``price_breakdown.mapping``
derives a unit rate's overhead and profit by summing the markup lines whose
category is ``overhead`` and ``profit``, so a bill head filed under ``overhead``
is reported to the estimator as part of the rate. Four separate files stated a
Chinese stack and they disagreed about 规费 alone three ways, filing it as
``other`` in one, ``overhead`` in two and ``tax`` in the fourth. A decision
that lives in four copies is not made until all four say it.

The census is taken by parsing rather than importing, because two of the four
files are demo packs whose names contain a hyphen and are loaded by path.
