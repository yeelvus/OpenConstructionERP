"""The module is discovered, mountable, and registers what it says it does.

A module that fails to import drops out of the registry silently rather than
raising, so "it is in the folder" is not evidence that it loads. The same is
true one layer down: a permission nobody registered denies nothing, and a rule
set nobody registered validates nothing, and neither says a word about it.
