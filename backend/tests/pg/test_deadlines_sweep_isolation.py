"""One row the sweep cannot write must not silence the sweep.

Found in production, not by reading: a single punch item held an
``owner_user_id`` that parses as a UUID and names nobody. The sweeper decided
who to notify with a format check, so it took that id as the recipient instead
of falling through to the project managers, and the insert broke the
notification foreign key. The failed flush left the session rollback-only, so
every later item in the same pass raised ``PendingRollbackError`` rather than
doing its work - on every tick, forever. Overdue deadlines stopped reaching
anyone on any project, and the only outward sign was the log.

Two independent guarantees are pinned here because the defect needed both to
be missing. The first stops that id from being chosen at all. The second is the
one that matters when the next unwritable row arrives for a reason nobody
predicted: whatever it is, the rows behind it still get their notification.

Same root as the false "Unassigned" in the register: a value that parses is not
a party that exists. See ``test_deadlines_party_resolution.py``.
