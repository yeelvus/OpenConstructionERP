"""Demo seed data for the bim_hub module.

Groups the EXISTING ``BIMModel`` rows of a project into a coordination
federation and a couple of saved element groups so the coordination hub
dashboard has something to show. This seeder NEVER creates new BIMModel
rows: it only queries the models already imported for a project and wires
them together.

Per project it creates:
    - 1 BIMFederation referencing every existing BIMModel of the project
    - N BIMFederationModel join rows (one per existing model)
    - up to 2 BIMElementGroup saved selections
    - 1 BIMModelDiff when at least 2 models exist

A project with no BIMModel rows gets nothing at all rather than an empty
federation - there is nothing to group.

The seeder is idempotent per project: each federation insert is guarded by
the unique federation name for that project, each saved group by its own
name, and the diff by its (old, new) model pair.
