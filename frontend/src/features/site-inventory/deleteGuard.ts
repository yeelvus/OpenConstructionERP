/**
 * What holds a storage location or a stock item in place, and how to say it.
 *
 * Both delete endpoints refuse with 409 rather than let the database do what
 * it would otherwise do quietly. A movement's `item_id` cascades, so deleting
 * an item takes its entire ledger with it; both of a movement's location
 * columns are SET NULL, so deleting a location turns a record of where
 * material went into a record of nowhere. Either delete reports success while
 * destroying the history, which is why the refusal exists at all.
 *
 * The refusal reaches the browser as one English sentence the server composed,
 * not as a payload: `detail` is prose. There is no holder list in it to read,
 * so it cannot be shown to somebody working in another language. This module
 * therefore counts the holders itself, from the rows the server counts, and
 * the page renders the sentence from those counts through i18n.
 *
 * The counts are the server's counts by construction, not an approximation of
 * them. The item guard counts movements filtered by `item_id`; the location
 * guard counts movements filtered by `location_id`, whose backend filter ORs
 * the source and destination legs exactly as the guard's own query does, plus
 * the items defaulting to it and the balances still standing there. So one
 * probe answers both questions a delete control has to answer: what would be
 * destroyed if this went ahead, and - when nothing would be - why this row is
 * the removable one.
