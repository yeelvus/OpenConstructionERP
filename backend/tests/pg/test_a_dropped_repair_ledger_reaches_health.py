"""A database with no ledger table repairs its rows and must not answer healthy.

The sibling in ``test_data_repairs.py`` proves the *runner* reports the two
halves separately: it monkeypatches ``_record`` to raise and asserts the repairs
still land while ``ledger_written`` comes back ``False``. That is one end of the
wire. This file is the other end, and it drops the table for real rather than
patching the function, because "the ledger write raises" and "the ledger table
is not there" are only the same thing if nothing between them is looking at the
schema.

What was wrong
--------------
The boot path read the outcomes off the report and dropped ``ledger_written``
on the floor. On this exact fixture - registry intact, rows repaired,
``oe_data_repair_ledger`` gone - ``/api/health`` answered ``status: healthy``
with ``data_repairs_failed: false``, which was true as far as it went and said
nothing at all about the half that had failed. The install could no longer
answer "did this repair run here", and no signal anywhere said so. That is the
one question a ledger exists to answer, so losing it silently defeats having
one.

Why it enters through ``publish_data_repair_verdict``
-----------------------------------------------------
Setting ``app.state`` by hand and then reading ``/api/health`` tests the
endpoint and not the wiring, and the wiring is where the defect lived: the
endpoint would have published the field perfectly well if anything had ever
written it. So the report goes through the same function the boot block calls,
which is the only writer of either field. Revert that function's
``data_repair_ledger_failed`` line and this test goes red; revert only the
endpoint's and it goes red too.

Transactional DDL
-----------------
The ``DROP TABLE`` runs inside the fixture's outer transaction, so it is visible
to every savepoint-joined session the runner opens and is taken back out of the
cluster by the rollback at teardown. PostgreSQL is what makes that possible;
this test could not be written on a database that commits DDL implicitly, which
is part of why it lives in the pg lane.
