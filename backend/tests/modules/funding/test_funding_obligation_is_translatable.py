"""A derived deadline has to be readable by somebody who does not read English.

The React client never showed the problem, because it renders a deadline from
the ``kind`` enum through its own locales and ignores the sentence the server
stored. Every other caller of the REST API got the sentence, and a sentence is
data: there is no later moment at which it can be translated.

So each derived obligation now carries the two halves that can be translated,
``detail_key`` and ``detail_params``, and the English prose in ``detail``
became the rendering of those two rather than the original of them. The tests
here hold the three things that arrangement can get wrong.

**The halves can disagree.** A sentence edited at the call site while its key
stays put leaves a row whose prose and whose key say different things, and
whichever a reader believes, the other one is a lie. Nothing about that is
visible: both fields are populated and both are plausible.

**A key can be minted and never translated.** ``check_i18n_orphan_keys.py``
counts keys called with a default value in the front end's own source, so a
key the back end writes into a row and the client never spells out is invisible
to it. The gate stays green whether the key reached 43 locale files or one.
Nothing else was checking, which is why the check is here and reads the locale
files directly.

**A translation can drop the number.** "Due {{days}} days after the award
period ends" is worth translating. "Due days after the award period ends" is
not, and it fails silently, because a missing interpolation value renders as
nothing at all rather than as an error.

The title has the same two halves and one more way to go wrong, so the same
three checks are made of it here. ``title_key`` is not stored: it is the kind
key for a deadline the server derived and empty for one somebody typed, and
what separates those is ``source``. Getting that line wrong is silent in both
directions - a key on a typed row replaces somebody's note with a generic
label, and no key on a derived row leaves the server's English on a page in
another language. The rollup carries the same string, so it carries the same
key, and the one value the key deliberately does not interpolate travels
beside it.
