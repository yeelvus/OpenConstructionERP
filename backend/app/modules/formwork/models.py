"""Formwork ORM models.

Tables:
    oe_formwork_system            - catalogue row (framed wall panel, slab deck, ...)
    oe_formwork_assignment        - links a project / BOQ position to a system
    oe_formwork_schedule_line     - optional pour-by-pour cycle under an assignment

Money columns use ``Numeric(18, 2)`` (the project's "money as Decimal" rule)
and serialise as strings via Pydantic in :mod:`app.modules.formwork.schemas`.

Every NOT NULL column carries an explicit Python-side ``default`` so an ORM
insert never depends on a DB-side default, and the matching migration
(``v3132_formwork_init`` plus ``v3262_formwork_rate_buildup``) carries the
equivalent ``server_default`` so raw-SQL inserts and column backfills on an
existing database are safe too. Losing either half is how the v3119
fresh-install cascade happened, so keep both in step. The migrations that
carry this table are ``v3132_formwork_init``, ``v3262_formwork_rate_buildup``,
``v3271_formwork_debrand`` and ``v3300_formwork_system_choice``.

Relationship loading is declared explicitly on every ``relationship()`` per
``.claude/rules/backend-modules.md``: the pour cycle is the point of an
assignment, so it loads ``selectin``; every back-reference and every
rarely-walked collection is ``raise_on_sql``, which still allows a free read
off an already-loaded instance but refuses to emit lazy SQL from the async
session.

class FormworkSystem(Base):
    """Catalogue entry for one physical formwork system.

    A system is the reusable thing the contractor buys/rents: a framed steel
    panel set, an aluminium slab table, raw plywood + studs, etc.

    A formwork rate has two components and only one of them amortises:

    * ``unit_rate`` - per-m2 acquisition (or full-job hire) cost of the panels
      themselves. Buy the set once, use it ``reuse_count`` times, so this is
      what gets divided down.
    * ``erect_strike_rate`` - per-m2 labour and consumables (release agent,
      ties, cones, cleaning) paid EVERY time the panels are set and struck.
      This never amortises: forming 1000 m2 over ten uses of a 100 m2 set
      costs ten sets of erect-and-strike labour, not one.

    Pricing only the first component is the classic way to under-price a
    concrete-heavy job, so both are carried here and reported separately on
    the assignment (see :class:`FormworkAssignment`).

    ``strip_time_days`` is the minimum age of the pour before the panels can
    be struck and moved to the next lift. It sets the floor on the pour cycle,
    so a schedule that turns the same set around faster than this is not
    buildable - the ``formwork.strip_time_respected`` validation rule checks
    exactly that.

    Three columns describe the system as a *choice* rather than as a price,
    because choosing between systems is the decision this module exists to
    support and a catalogue that carries only a rate cannot support it:

    * ``rate_basis`` says what ``unit_rate`` MEANS, and it is the one of the
      three that changes the arithmetic. A purchase rate buys the panels once
      and amortises over the reuses; a per-use hire rate and an all-in
      supply-and-fix subcontract rate are already per-use and must not be
      divided a second time. See :func:`app.modules.formwork.service.compute_cost`.
    * ``typical_reuses`` is the planning figure - what this system usually
      delivers on a normal job - as opposed to ``reuses_max``, which is the
      physical limit the panels survive. Nullable on purpose: NULL reads as
      "no published figure", which is honestly different from zero, and the
      chooser falls back to ``reuses_max`` for the hint.
    * ``cycle_days`` is the pour-to-pour turnaround the system delivers with a
      normal crew. It is NOT ``strip_time_days``: striking is the floor on the
      cycle, the cycle is strip plus clean, move, set and align. A climbing
      system strikes in 3 days and still turns around in 7.
