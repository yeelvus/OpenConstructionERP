"""Subcontractors event subscribers - feed cross-module facts into the rating.

When the NCR / HSE / Quality modules publish an event whose payload names a
``subcontractor_id``, this module bumps the corresponding sub's rating
counters for the *current* period and recomputes the weighted overall score.

The subscriber list is intentionally small (NCR, HSE incidents, schedule
slippage). Each handler opens its own short-lived session via
``async_session_factory()`` so a rating-write failure can never roll back the
upstream module's transaction.

Subscribers wired:
    ``ncr.created``                  → ``bump_rating_from_event(kind="ncr")``
    ``safety.incident.created``      → ``bump_rating_from_event(kind="hse")``
    ``schedule.activity.slipped``    → ``bump_rating_from_event(kind="schedule")``
    ``contracts.contract.signed``    → commit a subcontract's value to the budget
    ``contracts.claim.paid``         → pay a subcontractor claim's payable
    ``invoice.paid``                 → draw the subcontract commitment down
