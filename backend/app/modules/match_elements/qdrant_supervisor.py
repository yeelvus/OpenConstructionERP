"""Qdrant vector-DB supervisor - no Docker, no daemon.

Mirrors the existing converter-installer pattern from
:mod:`app.modules.takeoff.router` and :mod:`app.modules.boq.cad_import`:
we keep one binary under ``~/.openestimator/qdrant/`` and spawn it as a
plain subprocess whenever a feature that needs it (currently only
``/match-elements``) discovers the URL is unreachable.

Why no Docker?
--------------

Every other heavy dependency in OpenConstructionERP degrades gracefully
to a local-only path: PostgreSQL → SQLite, Redis → in-memory cache,
MinIO → local filesystem. Qdrant used to require a docker-compose
profile (``--profile ai up -d qdrant``) which made it the only thing
keeping Docker on the critical path. Qdrant ships a single self-contained
binary on every platform - using that directly removes the last Docker
dependency for a one-machine install.

Layout
------

::

    ~/.openestimator/qdrant/
        qdrant.exe          (Windows) or qdrant (Linux/macOS)
        config/
            config.yaml     (storage + service defaults)
        storage/            (Qdrant's collections live here)
        snapshots/          (incoming snapshot files)

The binary is fetched from GitHub Releases on demand by
:func:`install_qdrant_native`. The asset name pattern is
``qdrant-{triple}.{archive}`` - see :data:`_PLATFORM_ASSET` for the
mapping.

Lifecycle
---------

* :func:`find_qdrant_binary` - fast path-stat lookup, no network.
* :func:`probe_qdrant` - 1.5 s ``GET /readyz`` health probe.
* :func:`spawn_qdrant` - ``subprocess.Popen`` detached from the parent
  process so the server keeps running across uvicorn reloads.
* :func:`install_qdrant_native` - downloads + extracts the latest
  release for the current platform.

We do NOT track child PIDs across requests - re-spawning when the port
is already bound is harmless (Qdrant refuses to start and exits, the
existing instance keeps serving). For the same reason we do not try to
kill an existing instance on uninstall; the operator does that via Task
Manager / ``pkill qdrant``.

    Behaviour:

    * If ``url`` is None or empty → ``reachable=False``,
      ``installed=False``, message points at the install action.
    * If Qdrant answers on ``url`` → return reachable.
    * Else, if the binary is installed and ``spawn_if_installed`` is
      True → spawn it, wait up to 8 s for the port to come up, return
      the new state.
    * Else → return ``installed=False`` with a clear ``install_hint``.

    The 8 s wait is a budget, not a sleep - we poll every 400 ms so a
    fast-booting Qdrant (<1 s on SSD) returns almost immediately. The
    upper bound is short enough that a UI ``"Refresh status"`` button
    feels snappy.
