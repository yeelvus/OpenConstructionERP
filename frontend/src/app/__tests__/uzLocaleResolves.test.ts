/**
 * Uzbek (uz) is a new locale, built batch by batch rather than all at once:
 * `scripts/i18n_new_locale.py` extracts the full key set, and each batch is
 * hand-translated and assembled back into `uz.ts` as it is finished. Most
 * keys still carry their English source as an interim value while the rest
 * of the corpus is translated - that is expected and not a bug in itself,
 * `check_i18n_leak_baseline.py` tracks it separately. What this file checks
 * is narrower and permanent: the keys that ARE translated actually resolve
 * to Uzbek through the bundle the app builds, not just as text in the file.
 *
 * See `localeKeyResolution.test.ts` for why the file is read as source and
 * evaluated rather than imported (a 3MB object literal times out the vitest
 * transform pipeline) and for the module-nesting bug this pattern also
 * catches: a key written as a sibling of `translation` looks present in the
 * file and is invisible to i18next, which only ever sees `translation`.

/**
 * Uzbek Latin orthography is picky about a single character. The digraph

 * belgisi glottal stop in loanwords (`maʼlumot`, U+02BC MODIFIER LETTER
 * APOSTROPHE) are not the same as a plain ASCII apostrophe. A straight
 * quote in an actually-translated value is a typing slip - but most of the
 * corpus is still an untranslated English interim value while the rest of
 * the batches are worked through, and English prose ("doesn't", "founder's
 * note") legitimately carries straight apostrophes, and the odd example
 * value legitimately carries Cyrillic as literal data (a Russian sample
 * label inside a placeholder string, not a translation of the key itself).
 * Comparing against the English source, the same way
 * `check_i18n_leak_baseline.py` does, is what tells apart "not translated
 * yet" from "translated and wrong".
 *
 * One further exception on the apostrophe check: a digit immediately
 * before the mark is never Uzbek grammar, it is the feet/inches prime
 * notation a US-market drawing example writes as `12'-6 3/4"` - en.ts uses
 * the same plain apostrophe there, and `fix_uz_apostrophes.py` carries the
 * identical digit guard so it never "corrects" that mark into a tutuq

 * correct Uzbek translation of such a key keeps those samples verbatim,
 * because they are the strings the user will actually see in a spreadsheet.
 * Comparing whole values misses that: the value differs from English AND its
 * Cyrillic is legitimate. So each Cyrillic run is judged on its own - a run
