"""Read a person's name out of the id a register stored for them.

Free-text person columns are everywhere in this codebase - ``assigned_to``,
``created_by``, ``submitted_by``, ``approved_by`` - and three different things
legitimately land in them. Someone types a name. A seeder or a field
integration writes a contact id. An on-screen picker writes a user id. The
register then printed whichever it got, so rows read "Submitted by
3f2b8c1e-9a44-..." with an avatar lettered from a hex digit.

This module started life inside the punch list, which is the one register
somebody had thought about. Every other screen that prints the same kind of
column had no map at all, and a rule written once per caller is only ever
tested at the caller that was already right. So it lives here, and the punch
list reads it like everybody else.

What it deliberately does not do:

- It does not resolve a value that is not an id. Somebody typed a name and
  that name is already the answer; sending it to the database would be a query
  that can only fail.
- It does not invent. An id that answers to no contact and no user is absent
  from the result, and a caller must print the record as having an owner it
  cannot name rather than as unassigned. Telling a site manager a snag is
  unassigned invites a second assignment.
- It does not query per row. A caller collects a whole page of values and asks
  once, which is two queries for any page length.

    Contacts are asked first and users only about what is left over, so a page

    happen with generated ids and would mean the contacts register is the more
    specific answer if it ever did.

    Fail-soft throughout. Contacts is an optional module, a row can be deleted,
    and an id matching nothing resolves to nothing rather than to an invention.
    Each lookup runs in its own savepoint, so a missing table costs a name
