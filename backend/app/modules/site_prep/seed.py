"""Site prep demo seed - a mobilisation plan and its readiness register per project.

The module shipped complete and unseeded, so every screen it owns opened empty:
the readiness rollup had nothing to roll up, the commencement gate had no gates to
report on, and the category breakdown showed ten headings and no rows.

This writes what a project actually assembles before anyone starts work - access,
welfare, temporary power, hoarding, temporary works certificates, consents,
inductions - as one mobilisation plan per project with its readiness items hung
off it. Every item carries the ``plan_id`` of its own project's plan, which is
what makes the register a plan rather than a loose checklist: the plan's target
start date is the date the whole rollup counts down to.

Everything is written through :class:`SitePrepService` with a real
``SitePrepItemCreate`` payload, so each row passes the same Pydantic vocabulary
and the same in-project plan check as an item created from the API. A row this
seeder cannot write is a row the application would have refused.

Three things are derived rather than asserted, because a demo that states its own
conclusions stops being a demo of the engine:

  - Overdue is not a status. It falls out of a due date that has passed on an item
    that is not yet resolved, so the overdue list on the screen is computed by the
    readiness core from the dates seeded here.
  - The commencement gate is not a flag on the project. It is satisfied only when
    every gate item is ready or not applicable, so the projects that report a
    closed gate report it because their gate items really are closed.
  - Readiness percent counts ready items against applicable ones, so the items
    marked not applicable move the denominator the way they would on a real job.

Projects differ by the stage they are at, indexed by position in the seeding call
rather than drawn from the project id: a draw would hand two neighbouring demo
projects the same picture, and the stage is the first thing a reader sees. Within
a stage everything else comes from the project id, so re-seeding one project
reproduces it exactly.

Dates are anchored to the run date, never hardcoded, so a demo opened a year from
now still shows a site mobilising next month rather than one that mobilised in
2026.

Idempotent per project: a project that already carries a plan or an item is left
untouched, so a re-run never doubles the register.
