"""A shipped regional module has to be selectable at the one moment it is offered.

The onboarding wizard's module list is a hand-written mirror of the backend
module manifests. Nothing joined the two, so a module could ship, register its
routes, seed its data and never appear on the screen where a new workspace is
asked what it works on. That is what happened to ``china_pack``: it shipped
long before the list was written and was the only one of the thirteen country
packs with no line in it, so a Chinese user could not switch China on. The
fourteenth regional module, ``payment_clock``, was missing for the same reason
and for longer, and it was missed twice over because it does not carry the
``_pack`` suffix a search for the country packs would look for.

Hence the shape of this check. It keys on the backend manifest's own
``category`` rather than on a naming convention, because a convention is a
second thing to keep in step and this defect is exactly what happens when two
hand-kept lists drift. It does not require the reverse - that every picker key
name a backend module - because the picker's key space is deliberately wider:
``cost-benchmark`` and ``sustainability`` are frontend-only modules with routes
in ``navCatalog.ts`` and no Python package, and a check that called them dead
would invite someone to delete two working toggles.

The label mirror is checked in the same pass. An entry names two i18n keys, and
neither carries a ``defaultValue``, so a key that is missing from the base
locale reaches the screen as its own raw name.

These tests live in the PG lane because that lane is a merge gate and the
default unit lane is not, the same reason ``test_rule_set_reachability.py``
gives. Neither of them touches a database.
