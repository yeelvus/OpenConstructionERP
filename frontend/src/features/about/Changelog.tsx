 * Changelog: compact two-column release log on the /about page.
 *
 * Each entry is a single glass-style card with version, date, a short summary
 * line, and an optional tag badge. The card list is rendered as CSS columns
 * (`columns-1 md:columns-2`) so entries of variable height pack into the
 * shorter column automatically. There is no need to manually balance the
 * two columns, and a single tall summary doesn't leave the other side blank.
 *
 * Source-of-truth: a single hard-coded `CHANGELOG` array (see below). Entries
 * are kept short and plain per the user's request. The full prose lives in
 * repo-root CHANGELOG.md.

      'A firm can write its own cases instead of only reading ours, the credentials register can finally be opened from inside the product, and the securities that make a contract enforceable are held against the contract itself. Three modules ship for work that crosses borders: invoices filed where a government has to clear them, statutory withholding taken the way the governing statute defines it, and payment deadlines treated the way security of payment law treats them, all three over the API with their screens still to come. A drawing opened in DWG Take Off matches the file it came from again, approving a timesheet no longer fails because of the daywork sheet written after it, and roughly 320 new strings per language reach all 29 languages. The macOS start failure reported against 14.4.0 is not fixed here: the shipped file was read binary by binary and the explanation we had for it is wrong, which is said plainly rather than shipped as a fix.',

The sheet register has a screen worth opening, a re-uploaded drawing set now retires the sheets it replaces instead of leaving two of each number both claiming to be current, and the list is ordered and counted in a way the database has to repeat. The assistant reaches live project data whatever provider is behind it, an assembly applied from a template no longer folds an unconverted amount into a converted total, and DWG Take Off frames a drawing by its geometry rather than by its labels, keeps block definitions out of the sheet picker and stops rendering a right angle as ninety radians. The worked example in the bill of quantities paste box shows its columns again, after every tab and newline in it had lost its backslash in English as well as in twelve translations, and the sheets register no longer labels a superseded sheet as the current one in twelve languages.',

  { version: '10.9.0', date: '2026-07-10', tag: 'NEW', summary: 'Site issue management becomes one connected workflow: punch list items carry phone photos and a pin placed visually on the drawing with a full closure stepper, issues can be raised on the 3D model as open-standard BCF topics with a captured viewpoint and snapshot that import and export as a standard file, a drawing markup converts to a tracked issue in one click, checklists attach to an issue and a failed check raises one, the field shell captures a defect with a photo offline, and a new Issues hub unifies every open item across drawings, punch lists, non-conformances, model coordination and clashes with owner and overdue at a glance. Several delivery modules are deepened, led by a site-logistics gate timeline that lanes overlapping deliveries with per-gate occupancy and an exportable day schedule, and the guided Cases process strip is more compact with a prominent numbered title. It also fixes the PDF takeoff viewer to fill available height with a flexible layout, adds real-world line-width entry for linear measurements, and resolves a Files in-app bug report.' },
  { version: '10.8.0', date: '2026-07-08', tag: 'NEW', summary: 'The estimating tools from the last version now connect into one chain: a production norm expands into a priced assembly and grosses material up for waste, a labor build-up publishes as a reusable rate, the resource summary exports a material buy-list, and the estimate rolls the bill base, preliminaries and allowances into one total that the conceptual estimate reconciles against, with rates escalatable in time and by region. The dashboard delivery and quality cards are tighter with a two-column locations and weather panel, the Cases hub loads on scroll with a soft per-discipline card wash and drawn scenes for cases that ship without a picture, a resourceless bill position keeps its unit rate editable, and multi-currency estimate lines reconcile exactly to the total. The Cases hub shows the project lifecycle as labelled stage cards with a how-to translated across all languages, the pipeline builder labels the typed inputs and outputs of each step with a key for connecting them, newer maturing modules are marked beta, and more recent modules now appear in onboarding and the project journey.' },
  { version: '10.7.0', date: '2026-07-08', tag: 'NEW', summary: 'A wave of estimating tools takes a job from a first rough number to a documented bill: conceptual order-of-magnitude estimates with a guided copilot and a written basis of estimate, priced preliminaries and general conditions split into time-related and fixed, an allowances and contingency register, regional and time-based price indexing, labor-rate build-ups, a labor, material and equipment resource summary, net-to-gross waste factors, and production-norm expansion. Cost rates now flag when a price is going stale and suggest a refreshed value, AI-suggested assemblies are grounded in real per-unit factors instead of a flat quantity, and the desktop app shows the real reason if startup ever fails instead of the database shutdown noise.' },
  { version: '10.6.1', date: '2026-07-08', tag: 'FIX', summary: 'The app loads noticeably faster on first open: the 3D globe and 2D map libraries no longer ride along in the initial download for people who never open a map, and load only when a map or the geo hub is actually opened, which takes about 1.6 MB off first paint with no change in behaviour. Clicks inside the takeoff Link to BOQ picker no longer bubble to the measurement row and toggle the properties panel.' },
  { version: '10.6.0', date: '2026-07-07', tag: 'NEW', summary: 'Five new modules extend the platform past the estimate into delivery on site: site logistics with gates, laydown zones and delivery bookings, systems commissioning, off-site and prefab production with a quality gate before dispatch, ESG site performance against targets, and a monthly cost-value reconciliation with a cashflow S-curve and interim payment applications. Site coordination gets stronger too: meeting minutes now capture decisions and turn them into tracked action items that carry over across a recurring series, a new forms and checklists library lets you build reusable inspection and handover templates and fill them in on site, voice input turns spoken notes into structured diary, defect and task entries, and the finance module gains an invoice inbox that captures a supplier invoice, proposes the booking and keeps a tamper-evident archive through approval and posting. PDF takeoff adds per-measurement line opacity, a roof and ramp slope factor, a wastage allowance, a typical multiplier and copy to other pages, every guided case now shows a clear colour picture of each step, and this release also fixes takeoff calibration on reload, the pipeline builder run action, the cost database open error and the developer guide layout.' },
  { version: '10.5.0', date: '2026-07-06', tag: 'NEW', summary: 'Every step of every case now shows a small line-art drawing of what it does, chosen from the step itself so all 85 cases got them at once, falling back to a clean framed icon where none is drawn yet, and the same pictures now appear in the How it works hub. The Cases lifecycle timeline is bigger and matches the pickers below it, and twenty two new worked cases take the catalogue from 63 to 85, covering permits to work, plant registers, progress meetings, takt planning, AI element matching, 5D models, delay claims, a client portal, the common data environment, supplier catalogs, submittals, engineering changes and reactive facilities service.' },
  { version: '10.4.0', date: '2026-07-06', tag: 'NEW', summary: 'The Cases hub gets a hand-drawn look. Every case, professional role and company type now carries a light line-art illustration, the pickers are picture-left chips, each card has an illustration banner with a single discipline colour and a stack of role avatars, and the runner shows the art beside a bigger title. Missing art falls back to a plain glyph so nothing breaks. The two inbound capture webhooks also accept an X-API-Key header, so an external system can post with a shared key instead of a signed-in session, covered by tests.' },

On top of company type you can pick your professional role, estimator, quantity surveyor, site manager, project manager, BIM coordinator, procurement, planner, health and safety officer, design lead, document controller, commercial manager or foreman, each drawn as its own illustrated persona avatar. The whole catalogue is laid out along the project lifecycle, from Define through Design, Estimate, Procurement, Plan, Build, Handover and Operate, with a timeline across the top, a stage and a sequential number on every case, and the grid reading in the order a project runs. Eleven more cases were added for the thinnest roles, taking it from 52 to 63, and the dashboard Cases block now quick-launches into resumable and role-matched cases.' },
  { version: '10.2.0', date: '2026-07-06', tag: 'NEW', summary: 'The Cases hub is now organized by company type: pick how you work, general contractor, subcontractor, cost consultant, designer, developer, project manager, BIM consultant or owner and operator, and you see the cases that type of company runs, with a project pin to keep a project shortlist. The catalogue grew from 40 to 52 cases. Custom cost catalogues are easy to fill now, creating one opens the add position form and every custom catalogue has an add position button and empty state. Supporters get an Inside track panel at /inside with early access to what shipped and what is coming, and the client portal gains an Invoices tab and view-only BIM and CAD sharing. It also fixes a start-up failure where four streaming-or-json routes stopped the app from booting, checks catalogue ownership when adding or listing cost items, and converts an imperial takeoff volume depth correctly.' },
  { version: '10.1.0', date: '2026-07-05', tag: 'NEW', summary: 'The main dashboard gains five delivery and quality cards (upcoming milestones, RFI turnaround, submittals, inspections and punch list), each self-hiding when its module has no data and each explaining its own numbers. The estimate grid now explains itself too: the line total on hover, the labour, material and plant build-up behind a unit rate, missing quantity or price flags, each section share of the total, an AI confidence badge, a price provenance chip and a cost per square metre benchmark against your own past projects. It also fixes three takeoff issues: measurement to position unit conversion on linking, US trade units as convertible targets, and a document-space stroke width.' },
