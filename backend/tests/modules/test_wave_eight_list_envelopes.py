"""The wave-eight registers describe how much of themselves they return.

Eleven routes across seven modules moved from a bare ``list[XResponse]`` to
``{items, total, offset, limit}``: the ten this wave ranked by user impact, plus
``equipment/fuel-logs``, which was finished because it already carried a total
but which no screen reads. Every one of them already received a total
from its repository and threw it away with ``items, _ = ...``, so a site past
its fiftieth timesheet, ticket or incident was served fifty rows and no way to
tell that was not all of them.

Two tests, because there are two different ways to regress this:

#. :func:`test_every_migrated_route_answers_with_an_envelope` walks each
   router's registered routes. It covers ``equipment/fuel-logs``, which no
   frontend reads and which the envelope-consumer guard therefore cannot watch
   at all. A route quietly reverted to ``list[...]`` fails here.

#. :func:`test_the_total_is_the_registers_size_not_the_pages` drives one route
   with a stub repository that returns two rows and a total of 137. That is the
   assertion the shape test cannot make: a route could carry an envelope and
   still fill ``total`` with ``len(items)``, which reads as an honest page and
   is the exact lie this programme exists to remove.

No database: the repository, the service and the project-scope guard are all
stubbed.
