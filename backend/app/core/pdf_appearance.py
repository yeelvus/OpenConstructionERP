"""Persisted document appearance - how a generated PDF looks.

:mod:`app.core.pdf_branding` made *who* the document belongs to configurable
(the workspace logo and company name). It left the *look* hard-coded, and said
so: "Deferred follow-up (out of scope for this MVP, by design): a configurable
template engine - per-workspace margins / fonts / colours / header layout /
footer text". This module is that follow-up.

It stores the look once on the server, in a small JSON file next to the
branding one::

    <data-dir>/pdf_appearance.json

so every export from every browser produces the same document, and a workspace
that has set its own accent colour keeps it after a restart.

**What is configurable, and why exactly this set.** Every value here is one a
single shared layer can honour, so turning a knob changes every PDF the
platform generates rather than the handful of generators someone remembered to
wire:

* ``accent_color`` / ``footer_color`` - drawn by
  :func:`app.core.pdf_branding.branded_header_footer`.
* ``base_font_size`` - the body size the generator builds its styles from.
* ``logo_align`` - which side of the header the logo sits on.
* ``footer_text`` - replaces the default "Generated ..." line when set.
* ``show_page_numbers`` - some workspaces file these documents inside a larger
  bundle that carries its own pagination.
* ``page_size`` / ``margin_mm`` - read by the generator when it builds its
  document template.
* ``show_letterhead`` - whether the company letterhead
  (:func:`app.core.pdf_branding.branded_letterhead`) heads the first page. On
  by default, which changes nothing for a workspace that has not filled in the
  company profile, because there is then no letterhead to draw; a firm that
  prints on pre-printed letterhead paper turns it off.

**The typeface is deliberately NOT configurable, and this is the interesting
decision in the module.** The obvious knob to add here is a font family, and
the obvious way to offer it is reportlab's base-14 (Helvetica / Times /
Courier), which needs no font file. Those faces are Latin-1 only. This platform
prints in 40-odd locales and :mod:`app.core.pdf_fonts` exists precisely because
of that: it bundles DejaVu Sans for Cyrillic and Greek, references Adobe CID
packs for Chinese and Korean, and embeds Noto for Thai and Devanagari, then
funnels every face request through :func:`app.core.pdf_fonts.pdf_font` so a
generator asking for "Helvetica" gets the Unicode face instead.

Letting a workspace pick Times would route around all of that and print tofu on
every Russian contract and every Chinese receipt - a setting that looks
cosmetic and silently breaks half the product's locales, against principle #2.
Offering a *Unicode* serif or mono instead would mean bundling two more faces,
and the repository ships exactly one sans family on purpose.

So the size is configurable and the face is not. Anyone adding a family here
later needs a bundled Unicode face per option, not a base-14 name.

**Per document type.** On top of the workspace look, a document type (the RFI,
the pay application, the punch list, ...) can carry its own override, stored in
the same file under ``overrides``. :data:`DOCUMENT_TYPES` lists the types and,
for each, the fields its generator actually honours: a field the generator
never reads is not offered, because a setting that changes nothing reads as a
broken control. :func:`resolve_appearance` answers "how does this type look"
as the workspace look with the type's override laid over it; with no override
stored it returns exactly what :func:`read_appearance` does, so every document
prints as it did before overrides existed.

**Nothing here raises.** This mirrors the never-break contract of
:mod:`app.core.pdf_branding` and :mod:`app.core.pdf_stamp`: an appearance that
cannot be read, or that a hand edit filled with nonsense, falls back to the
platform default rather than failing an export. A document a customer is
waiting for must not be lost to a bad colour string.

stdlib-only and modelled on :mod:`app.core.app_branding`, reusing the same
data-dir resolution, so it stays cheap to import and needs no migration.
