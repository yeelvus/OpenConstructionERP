"""The seeded reconciliation must be a register a commercial manager can read.

The screen it fills is the culmination of the Soll-Ist case: a viewer is told
they will read the margin while the job is running. That promise fails in two
different ways, and only one of them is "the screen is empty".

Empty is the first: the module shipped with no seeder, nothing on the screen
is computed on read, so every install opened on three empty states. That is
what the row counts here gate.

The second is worse because it looks fine. A register whose margin is the same
figure in all three closed months has nothing to say; a register whose totals
disagree with the bill the viewer just looked at on the 5D screen argues
against itself; a register scaled from an invented contract value is a number
nobody can check. Those are what the arithmetic here gates.

Against a real PostgreSQL schema, because the reports carry a unique
constraint on (project_id, period) and the guard that stops a re-run doubling
the register is the thing most likely to break.
