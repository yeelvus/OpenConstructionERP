"""Refuse a migration that adds schema without first asking whether it is there.

Why this has to be a gate rather than a convention
--------------------------------------------------
The boot path builds the schema with ``Base.metadata.create_all`` before
anything reads ``alembic_version``. That is deliberate and documented in
``app/main.py``: the baseline revision is a no-op, the quickstart entrypoint
never runs ``alembic upgrade head``, and without ``create_all`` a fresh volume
comes up with no tables at all.

The consequence is that on every install this application has ever started, the
whole of the model metadata already exists by the time an operator runs
``alembic upgrade head`` by hand. Unguarded additive DDL then raises. PostgreSQL
runs DDL inside a transaction, so the failure rolls back the entire run rather
than one revision, ``alembic_version`` does not move, and every later revision is
skipped along with the data backfills inside them. An operator who is twenty-six
revisions behind can never catch up, and each attempt fails at the same object.

That is not hypothetical, in either of its two observed forms. It was reported
from an installation carried across four releases, stamped at ``v3258`` while
head was ``v3284``, failing on ``oe_eac_block_graph`` every time. And it was
reproduced directly against a database this application had booted: replaying
the chain over it died on

    (psycopg2.errors.DuplicateColumn) column "rejected_by" of relation
    "oe_changeorders_order" already exists

Why the verb list is what it is
-------------------------------
The predecessor of this gate checked ``op.create_table`` alone, and it checked it
with a matcher that required the receiver to be literally ``op``. Both halves of
that were too narrow, and the second one was what let the ``rejected_by`` failure
through: the revision that caused it writes

    with op.batch_alter_table("oe_changeorders_order") as batch:
        batch.add_column(...)

so the call is ``batch.add_column``, the receiver is not ``op``, and the gate saw
nothing at all. Sixty revisions in this tree use ``batch_alter_table``. The
matcher here is therefore receiver-blind: it asks what is being called, not what
it is being called on.

The verbs are the ones the tree actually uses, counted rather than imagined.
Every revision file was parsed and every attribute call collected:

    create_index               217 revisions
    create_table               173
    add_column                 151
    create_unique_constraint     9
    create_foreign_key           8
    execute(raw DDL)             7
    create_check_constraint      2

``create_primary_key`` is in the list with zero current users. That is on
purpose and is not a scan bug: a verb nobody uses yet is precisely the one that
ships unguarded the first time somebody reaches for it, and adding it costs
nothing today.

Raw SQL counts as DDL. Eleven ``op.execute`` sites in this tree issue CREATE
TABLE, CREATE INDEX, ADD COLUMN or ADD CONSTRAINT as text, and text fails the
same way a verb does. Most already write ``IF NOT EXISTS``, which is why that
string is one of the guard markers.

Deliberately absent: ``metadata.create_all`` (one revision), which defaults to
``checkfirst=True`` and is therefore guarded by construction, and every
``drop_*`` and ``alter_column``, which are not what collides with an
already-current schema.

What counts as guarded
----------------------
The revision must consult the database before it acts: any of the inspector
probes below, or ``IF NOT EXISTS`` in raw SQL. The check is deliberately
shallow. It asks whether the revision looks at the database at all, not whether
the guard is correctly placed around every statement, because a precise dataflow
answer would cost far more than it buys and the shallow question already catches
the whole observed failure mode. A per-object rule was measured against this
tree first and produced fifty reds, nearly all of them an index created
alongside the table it belongs to and already covered by that table's own guard.

Read with an AST rather than by grepping. ``op.create_table`` appears inside
docstrings in this tree, and a docstring is not a call: grepping for the text
counted nine revisions that create nothing.

The population is printed beside the verdict, and the count of files examined is
asserted against an independent count of the files on disk. A revision that
falls out of the scan has to become a failure rather than a smaller denominator,
because a shrinking denominator is invisible: the gate still says zero problems.

# widened to catch, 24f9595e16d0 and 85f7cfa6eecf; both were then guarded and the
# replay that used to die on DuplicateColumn was measured completing, so they
# came off the list rather than living on it.
#
# The mechanism stays here so the next person who needs it finds it instead of
# inventing a second one. Add a filename mapped to a one-line reason, and only
# for a revision that has already shipped, because editing a shipped migration is
# a decision about the product rather than a cleanup. A revision that has not
# shipped gets a guard, not an entry.
#
# The list is self-policing: an entry whose file has gained a guard, has stopped
# doing additive DDL, or has disappeared is itself reported as a failure, so it
# cannot rot into a permanent hole. Prefer emptying it to growing it.
