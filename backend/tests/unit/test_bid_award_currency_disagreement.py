"""One award, and every record describing it agrees what money it is.

Written as a failing control before the fix and kept as the regression for
it. The chains, as they were:

    bid_management/service.py   BidAward.currency  = data.currency or package.currency
    notifications/_wave5        Contract.currency  = data["currency"] or package.currency
    procurement/events.py       PO.currency_code   = data["currency"]
                                                     or winning_submission.currency
                                                     or package.currency or ""

Only the procurement chain consulted the winning submission. That difference
is invisible whenever the package declares a currency, because the first term
wins everywhere, which is why every existing test passes ``currency="EUR"`` in
the event payload and never reaches the rest of any chain.

It became visible when the package was unlabelled, and nothing prevents that:
``BidPackage.currency`` defaults to ``""`` and the validation that looks like
it would object requires both operands to be truthy::

    service.py:202-205
        package_currency = (getattr(package, "currency", "") or "").upper()
        submission_currency = (getattr(submission, "currency", "") or "").upper()
        if package_currency and submission_currency and package_currency != submission_currency:
            errors.append("currency_mismatch")

so an unlabelled package plus a EUR submission is not a mismatch, stays
``is_valid=True``, and is awardable.

``award_package`` now resolves the currency once and publishes it, so the
subscribers take the payload's first term and never reach their own fallbacks.
The two chains below are therefore still true statements about each
subscriber given a blank payload - a payload the publisher no longer emits -
and they are kept because that is the behaviour anything reaching those
handlers from elsewhere would get. The test that matters is
``test_one_award_is_labelled_two_different_ways``, which drives the real
``award_package`` and follows the payload it actually publishes.
