"""Working-day counting: work weeks, holidays and the edges around them.

Both ends of a range are inclusive here, which every count below assumes. That

implementation disagrees: ``schedule/progress_math.WorkCalendar`` documents
``working_days_between`` as "exclusive of the start date, inclusive of the end".
