"""Semantic search says it is unavailable instead of answering an empty list.

The endpoint used to catch the missing optional stack and return ``200 []``. The cost
grid draws that exactly as it draws a query that matched nothing, so a reader on a
deployment without the ``[semantic]`` extra was told their search had no results when
the search had never run. Every neighbouring endpoint in the same router already
answers 503 for the same condition, and the orchestrator above them documents 503 as
the graceful-degradation signal, so the odd one out was this one.

The client is still expected to fall back to lexical search. The point is that it can
now tell the reader it did.
