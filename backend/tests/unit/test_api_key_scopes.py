"""Unit tests for API-key permission scoping.

An ``APIKey`` row carries a ``permissions`` list that was written at creation
and read by nothing. These tests pin the rule that now reads it: the authority
of a request authenticated by an API key is the INTERSECTION of the owner's
live permissions and the key's declared list, so a key can be held below its
owner but never raised above them, and an empty list narrows nothing.

Two behaviours here would have passed against the pre-fix code and must not be
allowed to regress quietly:

* the narrowing is applied BEFORE the admin bypass, so an admin-owned key is
  narrowable at all - the case the column exists for;
* the ICS calendar feed, whose credential rides in a subscription URL, demands
  its scope be named outright and refuses a general-purpose key.

Pure: no DB, no app, no network. The calendar route is driven directly over a
stand-in session, and ``verify_project_access`` is replaced with a sentinel so
"the scope gate let this through" is observable without building a real project.
