# DDC-CWICR-OE: DataDrivenConstruction - OpenConstructionERP
"""DWG Takeoff demo seed - measurements taken off the drawing that exists.

The drawing itself is already seeded (``app.scripts.seed_dwg_drawing`` authors a
small floor plan with ezdxf and parses it through the same path an upload uses),
so what was missing was everything an estimator does *to* a drawing: nothing had
ever been measured on it, and ``/dwg-takeoff`` opened on bare geometry.

Every annotation written here is read back off the parsed drawing through
:meth:`DwgTakeoffService.get_entities` - the same reader the viewer uses - and
its coordinates are that entity's own coordinates. A closed polyline becomes an
area measurement whose value is the shoelace area of its vertices; a line becomes
a distance measurement whose value is the length between its endpoints; a text
label becomes a pin at its own insertion point carrying its own string. Raw
drawing units are converted to metres with the factor the parse recorded on the
version, and when the units are unknown the measurement is left empty rather than
stated wrongly. Nothing is placed at coordinates the drawing does not have.

What this seeder deliberately does not do
-----------------------------------------
* **It does not add a second drawing version.** A version row asserts that the
  drawing was re-issued and re-parsed. Pointing a second version at the first
  one's entities file would claim a revision whose geometry is byte-identical to
  the one it supersedes, and the revision-compare view would report a re-issue
  with no changes.
* **It does not add a second drawing.** There is no committed DXF asset in the
  tree to widen the register with; the one demo plan is authored at seed time.
  A second row therefore means authoring a second plan, which is new geometry.
* **It does not save entity groups.** Entity ids are positional (``e_{index}``,
  minted per read over the *layer-filtered* list), so a stored group selects
  different entities as soon as a layer is toggled off.

Idempotent per drawing: a drawing that already carries an annotation is left
alone, so a re-run never doubles the markup.
