# DDC-CWICR-OE: DataDrivenConstruction - OpenConstructionERP
"""A seeded programme has to read off the calendar, not off the row number.

Percent complete was derived from an activity's position in the template list,
which puts every value strictly between 0 and 100. Two things follow, and the
second is the one that leaves the schedule screen:

* no phase is ever finished and none is ever still to come, so a programme
  whose first phase ended last year shows it at ten percent;
* ``status`` is derived from progress, and progress is never zero, so every
  activity in every templated project is permanently ``in_progress``. Any
  screen, rollup or dashboard counting activities by status reads a programme
  that never starts anything and never finishes anything.

The templates ship absolute dates, so asserting against one of them would only
hold until the calendar moved past it. The fixture here is a template whose
phases straddle the day the test runs: two finished, two under way, two not
started, by construction rather than by luck.

Both seeding branches are covered. They differ in where an activity comes from
- hand-authored phases in the template against phases derived from the BOQ
sections - and not in how far along it is, which is what the shared derivation
now guarantees.
