"""``normalize_standard`` matches by substring, and that is a hazard with no victim yet.

The function recognises a contract family anywhere in a free-text hint, which is
what lets ``"NEC4 ECC Option A"`` and ``"nec3"`` both resolve to NEC. The cost of
that generosity is that an ordinary word containing the same letters resolves
too: ``"connecticut"`` contains ``nec``.

Nothing shipped trips it today - the sweep below checks every contract form the
demo packs declare - so this file exists to keep it that way and to make the
behaviour deliberate rather than discovered. A test is the right size for a
defect with no victim: it costs nothing now and it fails loudly the day someone
writes a project description that reads as a standard it is not.
