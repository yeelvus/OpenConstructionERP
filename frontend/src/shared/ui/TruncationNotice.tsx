/**
 * States how much of a collection is on screen when some of it is not.
 *
 * Renders nothing when the page is complete, so a call site can mount it
 * unconditionally. That is deliberate: the alternative is each surface
 * writing its own `total > items.length` test, and a surface that forgets
 * the test looks exactly like one that does not need it.
 *
 * This is the honest half of the paging contract. A list that pages needs
 * page controls; a list that cannot page — a picker, a modal, a dropdown —
 * still has to admit that it is showing a slice.
 *
 * The sentence names no noun on purpose. An earlier draft interpolated one
 * ("Showing 50 of 120 activities"), which reads well in English and forces
 * every other language to agree with a word it is handed at runtime, in
 * whatever gender, number and case that language needs. `cases.showing_count`
 * is the wording already settled and translated in all 40 locales for the
 * same question, so this reuses it rather than minting a key that would ship
 * its English default everywhere until 40 files caught up. The `cases.`
 * prefix is where the string was first needed, not a claim about who owns it.
