"""Unit tests for :mod:`app.core.demo_retention`.

This job deletes user data, so the suite pins the dangerous cases rather than
the happy path. What is covered, and why each one is here:

* A self-hosted install is never armed - neither by the retention window on
  its own, nor by the demo flag on its own.
* Seeded demo content survives at any age. The five demo projects are the
  reason the demo exists; a sweep that eats them has destroyed the thing it
  was protecting.
* A file inside the window survives.
* A blob another live row still points at survives, including when the other
  pointer is a recycle-bin snapshot whose own row is already gone.
* A row with no blob, and a blob with no row, are each handled without a
  crash - and the blob with no row is left strictly alone.
* A path outside the data directory is never unlinked.
* Two runs remove the same set: nothing the second time, with the on-disk
  file set unchanged.
* The database tripwire of the read-only demo does not refuse the sweep's own
  deletes even when a request write scope is bound to the context.
* The negative control: the sweep, called through its real entry point with
  its real arming, does delete an aged visitor upload - row and bytes. Without
  it a green suite would be indistinguishable from a job that does nothing.
