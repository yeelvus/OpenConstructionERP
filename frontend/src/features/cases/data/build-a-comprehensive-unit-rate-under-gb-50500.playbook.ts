// Case: "Build a comprehensive unit rate under GB 50500" (CN).
//
// The bill of quantities valuation code prices an item as a comprehensive unit
// rate: labour, material and plant for the work itself, plus the firm's
// management fee and profit, all inside one number the bill carries on one
// line. Everything the code puts OUTSIDE that number - the measure items, the
// statutory charges, the tax - is a head on the bill total and does not belong
// inside a rate.
//
// So the case is about composition, not about entry. The estimator's own
// labour, material and plant rates are the ones that matter, and the payoff is
// a rate analysis whose parts add up to the rate the bill shows. Content
// strings are key plus inline English default and live only here.

    "A comprehensive unit rate is the whole subject of pricing under the bill of quantities valuation code, and it is a composition rather than a figure: labour, material and plant for the work described, then the firm's management fee and its profit, and nothing else. The charges that sit outside it - the measure items, the statutory charges, the tax - are heads on the bill total, and an estimator who lets one of them drift inside a rate reports a management fee that is not the one the firm runs on. This case builds one rate from the bottom, on your own resource prices rather than on a borrowed average, and ends on the analysis that shows the arithmetic. Reading your own numbers back is the point; a rate you cannot take apart in front of a client is a rate you cannot defend.",
