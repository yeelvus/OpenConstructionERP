# DDC-CWICR-OE: DataDrivenConstruction - OpenConstructionERP
"""Pure field-time engine - all validatable timesheet logic, zero I/O.

This module deliberately imports nothing from :mod:`app.database`, SQLAlchemy,
FastAPI or any ORM model. It is the single source of truth for the rules that
decide whether a foreman's field timesheet is well formed, how a worker's hours
sum across a day, which lines become daywork sheet lines, how hours roll up into
cost, and how a reversing timesheet nets against the original it corrects.

Keeping the logic here (instead of inside :class:`FieldTimesheetService`) means
every rule is unit-testable on any interpreter - including the local Python 3.11
runner - without booting a database, exactly like ``schedule.progress_math`` and
``boq.cost_risk_engine``.

Vocabulary:

* A *line* is one worker-hours or plant-hours booking. A line is *labour* when it
  carries a ``resource_id`` and *plant* when it carries an ``equipment_id``.
  Exactly one of the two identifies a well formed line (labour XOR plant).
* A *worker* is the labour ``resource_id``. Per-worker hours are summed across a
  single day's lines and capped so a day can never book more than 24 hours.
* A *daywork* line books time-and-material work performed under an open variation
  and, on approval, is mirrored into a signed daywork sheet.

Money is ``Decimal`` throughout - never ``float`` - and serialised to a string by
the caller, matching the platform-wide money convention.

International by design. Nothing here hard-codes one country's working day, week
start, overtime threshold, break rule, rounding step or currency:

* Hours are computed from timezone-aware (or consistently naive) ``datetime``
  values, never from a locale-formatted date string, so day / month order never
  matters. Night shifts that cross midnight are handled explicitly.
* Overtime is OFF by default. Overtime rules differ by country and contract, so
  hours are only split into regular / overtime when a project supplies a daily
  threshold. With no threshold every hour is ordinary time.
* Rounding is OFF by default. When a project supplies a rounding step (for
  example a quarter hour) each entry is rounded to it; otherwise hours are kept
  to two decimals as booked.
* The week can start on any weekday. The default is Monday (ISO 8601), but a
  project may set Sunday or Saturday.

These knobs are read from a timesheet's ``metadata`` by :func:`read_hours_config`
so no database column or schema change is needed to configure them per project.
