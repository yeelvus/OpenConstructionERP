"""i18n plural guard: block a counted key missing a form its language needs.

The orphan guard answers "can this key be reached at all", and says so in
its own comments: a Russian file carrying only `_other` counts as reachable
there, because "reachable" and "complete" are different questions. This
guard asks the second one.

Why it matters, and it is not theoretical. i18next resolves a counted key
through the CLDR category its language returns for that number. When the
form is absent, it does NOT quietly fall back to `_other` in the same
language - it walks the fallback chain and prints the English. So a Turkish
file holding `_other` but no `_one` shows an English sentence on a Turkish
screen for every count of one, and every other gate we own reports green:
the key is reachable, the value is not byte-identical to English, no escape
was dropped, tsc and the build never look at locale content at all.

Three things worth knowing about how it counts.

  * Categories come from the language, never from English. English has two
    and would let Arabic ship four holes and Polish two. The table below is
    generated from the same source i18next consults, `Intl.PluralRules`.
    Six languages here have a single category, `other`, and for those an
    absent `_one` is the correct answer rather than a gap.

  * A suffix is not always a plural, and this is the whole difficulty.
    `assembly.params.err_div_by_zero` is division by zero and
    `agents.pick_one` is an instruction to pick one; neither is a form of
    anything. Grouping by suffix alone cannot tell those from a real
    plural, so this guard does not try. It asks the call sites instead: a
    key is counted only where the source calls `t(key, {... count ...})`,
    which is precisely the condition under which i18next consults CLDR at
    all. Keys nothing calls with a count are left alone, and a key named
    literally with its suffix is excluded outright.

    That makes the guard deliberately narrow. A count passed through a
    spread or a variable is invisible here and such a key goes unchecked.
    A gate that misses a case is repairable; one that cries wolf on 500
    ordinary keys gets switched off, and then it catches nothing at all.

    One narrowness was not deliberate and has been removed. The option scan
    required a colon after `count`, so it saw `{ count: n }` and was blind
    to the ES6 shorthand `{ defaultValue: ..., count }`, which is neither a
    spread nor a variable and so was not the limitation named above. It hid
    exactly sixteen rows of the same class the baseline already tracks, on
    `assemblies.bulk_delete_title` and `assemblies.bulk_tag_title`, leaving
    the gate green over half of a symmetric pair while reporting the other
    half. A blind spot that splits a pair is worse than one that drops both,
    because the half it does report reads as the whole population.

    Neither was the reverse, which showed up later and the other way round.
    The call site scan read the source as plain text, so a key named in a
    comment counted as named literally and its form was excluded from every
    locale at once. The test that forbids choosing a plural in JavaScript
    writes the anti-pattern out in prose, and those two names cost this gate
    37 rows about a key that is complete everywhere. Comments are blanked
    before either scan now, and `_blank_comments` says which way it errs.

  * A group is only judged where the language already answers it. A key
    absent from a locale entirely is the orphan guard's business, not this
    one, and reporting it here would fail two gates for one cause and make
    both messages less trustworthy.

Regenerating the category table, when a locale is added:

    node -e "const l=['ar','bg',...];const o={};for(const x of l)
      o[x]=new Intl.PluralRules(x).resolvedOptions().pluralCategories;
      console.log(JSON.stringify(o,null,1))"

Known debt lives in scripts/i18n_plural_baseline.json and may only shrink.

    A comment is not a call site, and reading one as a call site is not a
    hypothetical. ``pluralFormsAreChosenByI18nextNotByJavaScript.test.ts``
    spells out the anti-pattern it forbids, naming ``..._one`` and ``..._many``
    in prose, and those two names went into `literal` and excluded both forms
    of a real counted key from every locale at once. The guard then reported
    the whole product as missing them, on 37 rows, over a key that is in fact
    complete everywhere.

    Both scans are fed from here, not just the one that misfired. A comment
    showing ``t('x.y', {count: n})`` would put a base into `counted` that
    nothing calls, and the guard would then demand forms for a family that
    does not exist.

    The direction of failure is the whole design. Blanking too little leaves
    the behaviour this replaces, which is noisy and visible. Blanking too much
    would drop a real call site, the family would leave `counted`, and the
    guard would go quiet on a key that genuinely lacks a form, which is
    indistinguishable from health. So every ambiguity here resolves towards
    leaving the text alone: only comment spans are ever overwritten, string
    contents never are, and a quote the scanner misreads can at worst let a
    comment survive. A naive line-comment strip has the opposite bias, because
    ``'https://x'`` on the same line as a call would take the call with it.

    Lengths and newlines are preserved, so offsets into the result still point
    at the same characters as offsets into the source, which is what lets
    ``_options_body`` keep indexing it.
