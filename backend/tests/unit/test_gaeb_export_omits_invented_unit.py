"""The X83 export must not state a unit the source file never stated.

An X84 item carries no ``QU``, so the importer guesses a unit to be able to
store the row at all and records the source's silence in
``metadata["gaeb_unit_original"]``. Exporting that guess as a ``QU`` code turns
our guess into somebody else's fact: a reader of the exported file cannot tell
``psch`` we invented from ``psch`` a bidder wrote.

The exporter therefore consults the recorded original. The distinction is
membership rather than truthiness, and one of the tests below exists only to
hold that line: a row with no ``gaeb_unit_original`` key at all has no recorded
silence to honour, and must keep its unit.

Absence is not a statement about origin. It covers a row that never came from a
GAEB import, and also a row that did and whose unit a person has since changed,
because ``update_position`` retires the claim once the value it described is
gone. Both must export their unit. The second shape is exercised end to end in
``test_boq_unit_provenance_lifecycle.py``.
