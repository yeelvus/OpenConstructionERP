"""Refuse to start against a PostgreSQL the platform does not support.

The minimum is :data:`MIN_REQUIRED_PG_VERSION`, kept in step with the server
features the schema relies on (see ``backend/pyproject.toml``).

**How the version is read.** The authoritative source is ``server_version_num``,
the integer GUC every server since 8.2 exposes: ``160002`` for 16.2, ``90624``
for 9.6.24. It is a number, so there is nothing to misread - no locale, no
marketing banner, no release-candidate suffix. The major version is
``num // 10000`` in both the modern (``16.2`` -> ``160002``) and the pre-10
(``9.6.24`` -> ``90624``) numbering eras.

``SELECT version()`` is read too, but for two different jobs that must not be
confused:

* Always, as the human-readable string this returns and logs. It names the
  build, the platform and the vendor, which is what an operator needs in a
  failure message.
* Only when the ``server_version_num`` query itself could not be executed, as a
  documented *fallback* parse. Some poolers and wire-protocol proxies answer
  ``SELECT version()`` and nothing else.

The banner is a fallback for an *unavailable* number, never for an *unreadable*
one. A ``server_version_num`` that comes back and does not look like an integer
is a server we failed to identify, and this refuses to start rather than
guessing from a string that vendors are free to write however they like -
``"PostgreSQL 16.2 (Ubuntu 16.2-1.pgdg22.04+1)"``, ``"PostgreSQL 17beta1"``,
``"EnterpriseDB 16.2 (Advanced Server)"``, an Aurora banner, a fork that only
claims compatibility. Reading a number the server computed is the fix; a wider
regex only moves which strings get misread.

**Every failure raises.** Unreachable server, empty answer, unreadable number,
unparseable banner, version below the minimum - all of them raise
:class:`PostgreSQLVersionError`. Continuing past a version that was never
identified is the failure mode this module exists to prevent: the process would
come up, build a schema and take writes on a server whose capabilities nobody
checked, and the first symptom would arrive much later as a broken query. The
caller in ``app.main`` logs the cause and re-raises, so startup stops here.

**Two entry points, one rule.** :func:`validate_postgres_version` is the
application's, over the async engine it serves requests on.
:func:`validate_postgres_version_sync` is ``alembic/env.py``'s, over the sync
engine migrations run on - a database is reached that way too, by an operator
who has not booted the app, and that path builds the whole schema on a blank
server. Both are thin: they run the same two statements and hand the results to
:func:`_resolve_version`, which holds the entire rule. Nothing about the floor,
the authoritative source or the fallback is written down twice, because two
copies of a version floor drift apart.
