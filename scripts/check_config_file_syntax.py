"""Parse every tracked YAML and JSON file, as a category rather than by name.

These files are already parsed in a number of places, and saying so precisely
matters, because the first thing said about this gap was that nothing checks
them at all and that was wrong. Workflow YAML is loaded by five unit tests:
test_ci_lane_coverage.py, test_workflow_expressions_are_legal_where_they_stand.py,
test_release_signing_trigger.py, test_desktop_windows_packaging.py and
test_pre_commit_declares_what_the_lanes_run.py, which also loads
.pre-commit-config.yaml. On the JSON side 25 scripts and 80 files under
backend/tests call a JSON loader over the trees they own, locales and
capabilities and basemap styles among them.

What none of those do is cover the CATEGORY. Every one of them is addressed at
a named file or at one directory glob, so a new file of either kind, written
where no existing reader looks, is parsed by nothing at all. It can be
malformed and every lane stays green. That is the hole this closes and the only
one it closes.

For YAML the consequence is worse than a late failure. A workflow whose YAML
will not parse is not run by GitHub: no job, no log, no annotation on the
commit, no red. What arrives is silence, and we have already written down that
silence from a lane is indistinguishable from health. Two lanes here are read
as authoritative verdicts, so a broken workflow file would turn one of them
into a verdict nobody notices is missing.

Run from the repository root. The file list comes from git rather than from a
tree walk, so it sees what a checkout sees and ignores untracked scratch files,
which are the working tree's business and not the lane's.
