"""An uploaded logo costs a bounded amount of every PDF, and costs it off the
event loop.

The logo a workspace uploads is drawn on the letterhead of page one and in the
header band of every page after it, at about 60 x 20 mm. What reached the page
was whatever was uploaded, at its full resolution, and two shapes of that were
expensive enough to be a denial of service by a signed-in user:

  * An SVG says how large its page is in its own opening tag. A 146-byte file
    declaring a hundred thousand units passed the sanitiser, and the zoom that
    was meant to bound the raster had a floor under it, so MuPDF was asked for
    5000 x 5000 px - 95 MiB of RGBA. A six-page estimate took thirty seconds.
  * A 1000 x 1000 photograph is 3.82 MiB as a data URL, inside the upload
    limit, and went into the file at 1000 x 1000 to be drawn at 57 pt square.
    The RFI came out at 3.7 MB.

Both are measured here against an ordinary logo of the same kind rather than
against an absolute number, because what matters is that the hostile file is no
worse than the honest one, and an absolute threshold measured on one machine is
a flake on another.

The second half is where the work runs. These renders are seconds of CPU with
no await in them, so on the event loop they stall every other request the
worker is serving. The test for that watches the loop rather than reading the
source: a coroutine ticking beside the render counts how often it got to run.
