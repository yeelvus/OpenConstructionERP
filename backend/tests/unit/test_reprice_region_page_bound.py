"""Re-pricing a region must read it, and let go of it, one bounded page at a time.

``reprice_region`` used to pull the whole region into one buffered read - up to
its own 250 000-item ceiling - and then walk it. Measured against a synthetic
region, a work item costs ~4.6 KiB once its two JSON documents are decoded onto
the ORM instance, so the ceiling is ~1.1 GiB and a real 55 700-item base is
~250 MiB, held for the whole pass on a server whose floor is 3 GB.

Paging that read is only half of the bound, and the half that is easy to believe
in wrongly. These are entities the loop then MUTATES, so the session keeps every
one of them until the transaction ends whatever shape the read had. The page has
to be flushed and released as well, which is why the recorder below models an
identity map and why the peak it holds - not the size of a page - is what the
third test asserts. A recorder that forgot its rows would report a flat peak
whether or not the release happened and could not tell the two apart.

The bound is checked by watching what the pass asks for and holds, rather than
by measuring memory. Page size and retention are what this code decides;
resident bytes are decided by the driver, the allocator and the collector too,
and a test measuring them would fail for reasons unrelated to this loop.

The controls: one run with the bound raised out of reach, which is what removing
the paging would look like from inside the loop, and one comparing a paged pass
against an unpaged one on every number they report and every rate they write -
paging a walk is only correct if it changes nothing but the peak.

The last two cover the other half of the change. The 250 000-item ceiling is
itself a truncation, and it used to be a silent one: the pass stopped there and
reported ``items_total`` as if that were the region, with ``coverage`` computed
against it. Now it says so - and a region that ends exactly ON the ceiling is
complete and must not say so.

No database is involved: the session is replaced by a recorder that serves the
pages the statement asks for and holds them until they are expunged.
