"""The equipment list routes describe how much of themselves they return.

``GET /equipment/`` used to answer with a bare ``list[EquipmentResponse]``. The
repository had counted the yard on every call and the route discarded the count
with ``items, _ = ...``, so a fleet of 340 units answered with 50 rows and no
way for a dispatcher to tell there were 290 more.

Three tests, because there are three different ways to regress this:

#. :func:`test_the_fleet_register_answers_with_an_envelope` walks the router's
   registered routes. A route quietly reverted to ``list[...]`` fails here.

#. :func:`test_the_total_is_the_yards_size_not_the_pages` drives the route with
   a stub repository that returns two rows and a total of 340. That is the
   assertion the shape test cannot make: a route can carry an envelope and
   still fill ``total`` with ``len(items)``, which reads as an honest page and
   is the exact lie this programme exists to remove.

#. :func:`test_the_taxonomy_never_claims_to_be_truncated` pins the deliberate
   asymmetry next door. ``GET /types/`` is enveloped for uniformity but is read
   whole by a repository method that takes no offset or limit, so its ``total``
   must always equal its ``items``. A future edit that pages it without paging
   the type picker on the equipment form would silently shorten a dropdown.

No database: the repository is stubbed.
