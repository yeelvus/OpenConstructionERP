"""Teams module-specific validation rules.

Access control is configuration, and configuration is exactly the kind of thing
that is silently wrong. A restriction typed against the wrong team, a team
emptied out after a handover, a second team promoted to default: none of these
throw an error at the point they are made, and none of them are visible from
the record they affect. They surface as "why can nobody open the tender pack"
three weeks later. These rules run over a project's whole access configuration
and say so up front.

The rules live in one rule set, ``teams``, and read a single collected snapshot
of the project (see :func:`collect_project_snapshot`), so the whole set is one
pass over four queries rather than one query per rule.

* ``teams.default_team_present``    - ERROR. A project resolves "add a member"
                                      through exactly one active default team.
                                      Zero makes the resolution lazy-create a
                                      team nobody chose; two make it arbitrary.
* ``teams.restriction_has_viewer``  - ERROR. A restricted record whose named
                                      teams have no members between them is
                                      readable by nobody but the project owner
                                      and system admins. This is the "we locked
                                      ourselves out" failure, and it is the
                                      single most common way a visibility model
                                      goes wrong in practice.
* ``teams.restriction_scope``       - ERROR. Every restriction on a project's
                                      record must name a team of that same
                                      project. A row pointing elsewhere is
                                      inert against this project's reads, so it
                                      looks like protection and is not.
* ``teams.empty_team``              - WARNING. An active team with no members
                                      grants nothing. Harmless on its own,
                                      which is why it is a warning, and the
                                      cause of the error above once it starts
                                      holding restrictions.
* ``teams.duplicate_team_name``     - WARNING. Two active teams sharing a name
                                      are indistinguishable in the picker, so a
                                      restriction can be pointed at the wrong
                                      one and read as correct afterwards.
* ``teams.restriction_enforced``    - WARNING. A restriction on a record kind
                                      no consumer subtracts yet is recorded but
                                      not enforced. Saying so is the honest
                                      alternative to letting the UI imply a
                                      lock that is not there.
* ``teams.roster_ticket_valid``     - WARNING. Somebody on the roster is
                                      working on a ticket that has run out.
* ``teams.roster_window``           - WARNING. An active roster line whose last
                                      day has passed, so the roster answers
                                      "who is on site" with somebody who left.
* ``teams.roster_site_lead``        - WARNING. A roster with nobody in a
                                      supervisory role cannot say who runs the
                                      job.
* ``teams.roster_covers_access``    - WARNING. Somebody can open the project
                                      but is on no roster line, so their name
                                      lands on records with no trade or firm
                                      behind it.

Every rule reads the snapshot only. None of them queries, so none of them can
fail on a session that has already been rolled back, and the whole set is
usable from a read-only replica.
