"""An inspector flags a non-conformity and a pin appears on the map.

Two layers are gated here, and they fail differently.

The subscriber layer (``geo_hub._on_ncr_created``) is exercised by
publishing ``ncr.created`` directly. It has to draw a pin from the event
payload alone, be idempotent on replay, and stay quiet about the ordinary
case of an NCR with no coordinates.

The end-to-end layer goes through ``POST /api/v1/ncr/`` and is the one that
catches the bug the subscriber tests cannot see. Event subscribers open
their own sessions, so an event published from inside a still-open
transaction describes a row nothing else can read yet. The publish is
therefore deferred to ``after_commit``, and the only way to know that
actually holds is to create an NCR through the API and look for its pin.
That is what ``TestEndToEnd`` does; it is deliberately run several times,
because a race that is lost half the time passes a single-shot test half
the time too.
