"""The read side says which VAT rate is in force, and where it came from.

``compute_estimate`` substitutes the project's own rate for a stack's single
tax line, and everything downstream of the computation reports the figure it
used. The read path did not: it served the stored steps, so an editor showing
a tax line at nought belonged to a bill costed at the project's rate with
nothing on screen saying so. ``EffectiveVat`` is that missing sentence.

What is asserted here is the resolution, not the pricing. The pricing is
already held by ``test_one_country_one_markup_stack.py`` on the catalogue
branch and by ``tests/pg/test_methodology_takes_the_projects_vat.py`` on the
stored branch. This file holds the third statement, that a reader is told the
same thing the engine did, which is the one that was missing.

The project lookup is stubbed rather than stored, so these run in the plain
unit lane. What cannot be stubbed away is the rule for when a single project
figure may stand in for a stack: the resolver and the override read it from
one helper, and the last test here is what stops a future edit from restating
it in one place and not the other.
