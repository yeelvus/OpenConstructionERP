"""BOQ unit normaliser.

Estimators globally use thousands of locale-specific units that no curated
allowlist can ever cover: Romanian ``Bucat``, Bulgarian ``бр``, Russian
``шт``, German ``Stück``, French ``unité``, CWICR multi-prefix forms like
``100 EA``, plus per-trade slang ("man-day", "lin.m", "MWh", "%").  A
strict allowlist meant every regional CWICR import re-surfaced the same
422.  Policy is now **sanitise, don't gate**:

* canonicalise common synonyms via the alias table so aggregations don't
  fragment ("tonne" / "tonnes" / "mt" → "t"),
* otherwise return the input lowercased and stripped, regardless of
  script (Latin, Cyrillic, Greek, CJK, accented),
* reject only the genuinely unsafe shapes - empty, > 30 chars,
  control characters, HTML / SQL / quote characters, or a non-letter /
  non-digit leading character.

GAEB X83 export still needs a known QU code per row; rows whose unit
isn't in :data:`APPROVED_UNITS` are emitted with QU="StPa" and the
original string preserved in the ``Bezeichnung``.  The exporter, not
this validator, is responsible for that mapping.
