/**
 * The one place that binds PDF.js to this bundle.
 *
 * Every viewer (takeoff, plan room, punch pin board, markups, revision
 * compare) used to configure the worker on its own. Since PDF.js 5 the
 * library also needs two things served next to the bundle: the WebAssembly
 * decoders for JBIG2 and JPEG 2000 images, which the worker fetches on demand
 * under `wasmUrl`, and the ICC profile it uses for CMYK colour under `iccUrl`.
 * A scanned drawing is very often a JBIG2 or JPX image, so a viewer that
 * forgets either option renders a blank page for exactly the documents a
 * takeoff is most likely to receive. Routing every `getDocument` through
 * `openPdf` means no viewer can forget them.
 *
 * Build choice. This imports the `legacy` build on purpose. The default build
 * of PDF.js 6 is compiled for "the latest browsers" and relies on
 * `Map.prototype.getOrInsertComputed`, `Promise.withResolvers`, `Promise.try`
 * and `Float16Array` without polyfills. The legacy build carries the
 * polyfills and documents its floor (Chrome 125, Safari 18, Firefox ESR),
 * which is what the desktop WebView on an older macOS and the browsers in a
 * site office actually run. It costs about 100 KB across the two files.
 *
 * Asset layout. The wasm and ICC files are copied at build time by the
 * `pdfjs-assets` plugin in vite.config.ts into `assets/pdfjs/<version>/`, and
 * the dev server streams the same paths out of node_modules. The version
 * segment matters: the backend serves everything under `/assets` with a
 * year-long immutable cache header, and the file names inside the PDF.js
 * package never change between releases, so without the segment a bump would
 * leave browsers pairing a new worker with a cached old decoder. Both sides
 * read the version from the package, so they cannot drift apart.
 *
 * Teardown. PDF.js 6 removed `PDFDocumentProxy.destroy()`; the loading task
 * owns the worker transport now. `closePdf` is the one spelling of that, so a
 * viewer cannot keep calling a method that no longer exists behind optional
 * chaining and silently leak the parsed document for the life of the tab.
