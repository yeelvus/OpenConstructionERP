# DDC-CWICR-OE: DataDrivenConstruction - OpenConstructionERP
"""The Field Time demo seed must fill the register, and fill it only once.

Field Time shipped with no timesheet data anywhere, so the screen rendered
byte-identical on every demo project. The seeder that fixes that has three ways
to be wrong that a green exit code cannot show, so each is pinned here against a
real database:

* it writes rows the application itself would reject (every row goes through
  ``FieldTimeService``, so a validation error surfaces as a raised exception and
  an empty register rather than as bad data);
* it doubles the register on the second boot, because idempotency in this
  codebase is per loop rather than per seeder;
* it produces rows the downstream readers cannot use. Payroll only counts a line
  that is approved, not a reversal, and carries a ``resource_id``; a register
  full of drafts reads as zero there and no error is raised anywhere.

The last one is asserted through the payroll collector itself rather than by
restating its ``WHERE`` clause, so a change to what payroll counts fails here.
