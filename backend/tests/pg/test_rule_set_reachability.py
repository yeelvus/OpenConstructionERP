"""Every rule set a module asks the engine for must resolve to real rules.

A rule set is a name, and nothing checks that the name means anything. Rules
register into the set named by their ``standard`` unless the registration
passes an explicit list, so renaming a constant, or writing a rule whose
``standard`` does not match the set its module requests, leaves the module
calling ``validate(rule_sets=["something"])`` against an empty set. The call
succeeds. The report comes back clean. Nothing ran.

That is not hypothetical: three ``ai_takeoff`` rules shipped with full i18n
messages in three languages and never executed once, because no caller ever
passed that set name. The rules were eventually deleted, but the shape that
hid them is still here, and it is invisible to every other kind of test. A
behaviour test for a dormant rule passes by asserting the absence of a
finding, which is exactly what a dormant rule produces.

Registration happens along two routes and the check has to know both, or it
reports its own blind spot as a defect. Core rules land in the registry when
``register_builtin_rules`` runs. Module rules land when a module's
``validators`` module is imported, or when the module loader awaits that
package's ``on_startup`` hook, and no in-process test does either. So the first
route is checked by asking the live registry and the second by reading the
source: a set counts as reachable if some module registers into it and the
package exposes the startup hook that performs the registration. The subprocess
sweep at the end of this file does walk both module routes for real, in its own
interpreter, and is what the demo allowlist is re-asked against.

These tests live in the PG lane because that lane is a merge gate and the
default unit lane is not. The check itself needs no database.

# shipped from. A demo template declares its rule sets as a plain list literal
# in ``app/core``, never touches the constant convention, and is what the
# product reads when it seeds a project: ``demo_projects.py`` writes
# ``template.validation_rule_sets`` onto the project row and seeds the first
# validation report from the same list. So the name a demo carries is the name
# a user's dashboard runs, and nothing checked it.
#
# It was wrong. Both Hungarian demos asked for ``tetelrend``, which is the
# classification standard, not a rule set; the Hungarian rules register under
# ``hungary``. The engine logs an unimplemented rule set and continues, so two
# country demos ran the generic quality rules and none of their country's own,
# including the material and fee split that is the one thing every Hungarian
# bill is quoted in. Nothing was red anywhere.
#
# The reader below takes both syntactic forms on purpose. Eight of the forty
# nine declaration sites write the dict form, ``"validation_rule_sets": [...]``,
# rather than the keyword form, and a reader shaped like one of them is blind
# to the other. That is the same mistake this file already records against
# itself higher up, and repeating it here would have hidden the seed scripts.

# ── The registry a dashboard actually runs against ─────────────────────────
#
# Everything above asks a registry that only ``register_builtin_rules`` has
# filled. That is not the registry the product runs. The module loader imports
# every module's ``validators.py`` at boot, and those imports register rules of
# their own, some of them into sets they do not own. So the allowlist above can
# be green while the shipped software disagrees with it, and the population is
# the reason: the check never loaded the half of the tree where the
# disagreement lives.
#
# It was not hypothetical. The carbon module registered its 6D coverage rule
# into ``project_completeness`` as a second set alongside ``carbon_6d``. At
# runtime that made the set resolve to a rule, so ``resolve_rule_sets`` put it
# in the supported bucket, the report stopped listing it as unimplemented, and
# the twenty two demo dashboards that ask for it showed completeness as a check
# that ran and found nothing. The rule itself returns no results unless the
# data carries BIM element counts, which a BOQ demo never does, so there was
# nothing on screen to contradict the clean bill either.
#
# Both module routes are walked, and the difference between them is not small:
# importing the validator modules alone reaches 36 rule sets, running the
# startup hooks as well reaches 62. A sweep that stopped at the imports would
# have been a corrected population that is still half the registry, and the
# module that registers from its hook is the one it would miss.
#
# The sweep runs in a subprocess on purpose. Importing forty two validator
# modules and awaiting a hundred and sixty two startup hooks mutates the
# process-global registry for every test that follows, and a registry that
# grows on import answers differently depending on the order tests run in.
