/**
 * Pure filtering + ordering of BCF topics for the Model Review dock.
 *
 * A coordinator walking a model asks four questions in a row: what is still
 * open, what is late, what is mine, and what belongs to the model currently on
 * screen. Each of those is a predicate over the already-loaded topic list, so
 * they live here as pure functions - trivially unit-testable, and shared by the
 * dock, the agenda that feeds the guided walk, and the session hand-over.
 *
 * Scoping to the active model is deliberately OPT-IN. A topic carries
 * `bim_model_id` only when it was raised against a model, so "this model" is a
 * genuinely smaller set that would silently hide imported issues if it were the
 * default. The dock always shows the count next to the chip so the reader can
 * see what the narrowing costs before they click it.
