"""Field Time API routes.

Endpoints (mounted at ``/api/v1/field-time``):

    GET    /timesheets/?project_id=X             - List with filters
    GET    /timesheets/summary/?project_id=X     - Project rollup
    POST   /timesheets/suggest-cost-codes/       - Ranked cost-code suggestions
    POST   /timesheets/offline/                  - Record a day captured offline
    POST   /timesheets/offline/withdraw/         - Withdraw a day captured offline
    GET    /timesheets/working-time-regimes/     - The statutory regimes on offer
    GET    /timesheets/working-time/             - Worker-day working-time record
    GET    /timesheets/working-time.csv          - The same record as a CSV file
    GET    /timesheets/{id}/                      - Get one
    PATCH  /timesheets/{id}/                      - Update draft header
    DELETE /timesheets/{id}/                      - Delete draft
    POST   /timesheets/{id}/lines/               - Add a line to a draft
    PATCH  /timesheets/{id}/lines/{line_id}/     - Update a draft line
    DELETE /timesheets/{id}/lines/{line_id}/     - Delete a draft line
    POST   /timesheets/{id}/submit/              - Submit for approval
    POST   /timesheets/{id}/approve/             - Approve (posts hours, mints daywork)
    POST   /timesheets/{id}/reverse/             - Reverse an approved timesheet
    GET    /timesheets/{id}/validation/          - Validation report (read-only)

Every endpoint enforces project access (IDOR-safe: 404 on both missing and
forbidden) and the field_time RBAC permissions.
