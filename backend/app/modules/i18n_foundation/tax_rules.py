"""Combining tax rates for one jurisdiction, and the rules a row must obey.

Two things live here, and they are the same subject seen from the write side
and the read side.

**The resolver.** Given every tax row a country carries and the subdivision a
project sits in, work out the total rate payable and say how it was arrived
at. Three regimes have to come out right, and they are not variations of one
shape: a harmonised rate replaces the federal one, a separate provincial rate
is charged alongside it on the same pre-tax amount, and a compounding rate is
charged on the amount including the federal tax. Ontario is 13, British
Columbia is 5 + 7, and a compounding 7 on a federal 5 is 12.35 rather than 12.
An implementation that adds the federal rate to whatever the province charges
is right in British Columbia and reports an 18 % Ontario invoice.

The mirror-image mistake is adding up rates that were never meant to combine.
A country's standard rate and its reduced tiers are *alternatives*: one supply
is charged at one of them, and 19 + 7 is not a German rate anybody pays. Only
sub-national rows combine; tiers are chosen between, and ``is_default`` is what
says which tier is the standard one. This module made that mistake until
2026-08-26, and made it only where no test looked - on the shipped seed file,
where Germany resolved to 26 %, the United Kingdom to 25 % and France to 35.5 %,
while every fixture in the suite carried a single rate per country and passed.

**The write rules.** A row that does not say which subdivision it belongs to
cannot be found by the resolver, so it is not merely wrong, it is invisible:
the province falls back to the federal rate and nothing anywhere says a rate
was missed. :func:`validate_tax_row` is what stops such a row being written,
and it runs on every path into the table rather than on the API schema alone.

No function here touches the database or a Pydantic model. Rows arrive as
:class:`TaxRateRow`, which both a live ORM row and a line of the shipped seed
file convert into, so the arithmetic the tests check against published figures
is the same arithmetic the API serves.

#: How the resolver arrived at its answer. Every member is a distinct
#: situation a caller may need to act on differently, and in particular the
#: two that produce no provincial rate are kept apart:
#:
#: ``harmonised``
#:     One rate replaces the federal one. Ontario, 13 %.
#: ``stacked``
#:     Federal plus one or more provincial rates, all on the pre-tax amount.
#: ``compounded``
#:     At least one provincial rate is charged on the federal-inclusive
#:     amount, so the total is more than the sum of the rates.
#: ``federal_only``
#:     The subdivision is one this platform knows and it levies nothing of
#:     its own, so the federal rate is the whole answer. Alberta, 5 %.
#: ``national``
#:     The country has no sub-national tax axis at all; its default
#:     country-wide rate is the whole answer. Germany, 19 %.
#: ``subdivision_unknown``
#:     A subdivision was needed and was either not supplied or not one this
#:     platform carries. **No rate is returned.** This is the member that
#:     stops "nobody chose a province" from being served as Alberta.
#: ``no_configuration``
#:     The country has no rates on file at all. No rate is returned.
#: ``default_rate_ambiguous``
#:     The country has several country-wide rates in force and they do not
#:     say which one is the standard rate - none is flagged ``is_default``,
#:     or more than one is. **No rate is returned**, for the same reason
#:     ``subdivision_unknown`` returns none: any of the candidates is a real
#:     figure and picking one would be a guess wearing a real figure's face.
#:
#:     There were three ways to answer this and the ranking between them is
#:     the point, so it is written down rather than left to be re-derived.
#:     Returning **a plausible rate** is the worst kind of wrong: it is a
#:     number a caller puts on an invoice, with nothing on it to say nobody
#:     verified it, so the error is invisible until a customer disputes it.
#:     Returning **zero** is worse still, and it is the one that looks
#:     harmless - zero reads as a deliberate exemption, computes without
#:     complaint, and produces a document that is both wrong and confident.
#:     Returning **no number** is the only one of the three that a caller
#:     cannot mistake for an answer. A gap is visible; a wrong rate is not.
#: ``default_rate_not_in_force``
#:     The country's standard rate is on file and its window does not contain
#:     the date being asked about. What is in force instead is a reduced tier
#:     that runs alongside the standard rate rather than before it. **No rate
#:     is returned.**
#:
#:     This is the member that had been answering with a number. A lone
#:     unflagged row in force was promoted to the standard rate, so Germany
#:     priced 1990 at 7 %, Britain priced 1990 at 0 % and Russia priced 2010
#:     at 10 %, each with ``resolved`` true and nothing on the answer to say
#:     it came from another tier. A rate that exists is not a rate that
#:     applies, and the difference is only visible on the date axis.
#:
#:     It is not ``default_rate_ambiguous``: there the data cannot say which
#:     of the rates in force is the standard one, here it says so plainly and
#:     the answer is that the standard rate had not started yet.

    out of every per-province lookup, and the province then answers with the
    federal 5 % - a wrong total that no error, no log line and no health check
    reports, because nothing was missing, only mislabelled.

    Args:
        country_code: ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 of the row being written.
        combination: The proposed ``combination`` value.
        subdivision_code: The proposed subdivision, already normalized.
        rate_pct: The proposed rate, as it will be stored. Optional only
            because a caller may be validating a row it is not writing the
            rate of; when given it must parse as a decimal, because the column
            is a string and an unparseable rate is not caught until a lookup
            reaches it, at which point it is a 500 on a read of stored data
            rather than a rejection of the write that caused it.
        country_has_federal_layer: Whether the table already holds a
            ``federal`` row for this country. A country with a federal layer
            has a sub-national structure by definition, so ``national`` is
            meaningless there and is rejected. Callers that cannot query
            (the seed loader) leave this ``False`` and rely on the registry
            check, which covers Canada either way.
