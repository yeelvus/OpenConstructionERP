# DDC-CWICR-OE: DataDrivenConstruction - OpenConstructionERP
"""Field Time service - business logic for the foreman's field timesheet.

Stateless service layer over the pure engine
(:mod:`app.modules.field_time.field_time_math`). Responsibilities:

* Timesheet + line CRUD while the timesheet is still a draft.
* The lifecycle ``draft -> submitted -> approved``, with validation gating each
  forward step (a submit / approve is blocked when any ERROR-severity rule
  fails). Once approved a timesheet is immutable; the only correction is a
  reversing timesheet (the original flips to ``reversed`` and a new timesheet
  with ``reverses_id`` set nets it out - see :meth:`reverse_timesheet`).
* On approval, mirroring each daywork line onto a signed daywork sheet via the
  variations service, and publishing the hours / cost rollup so payroll and the
  cost / EVM model can reconcile against real booked time.

All money is ``Decimal`` and all cross-module reads are best-effort: a missing
optional collaborator degrades gracefully rather than failing the transition.
The service never commits - it flushes and lets the request-scoped session
commit, matching every peer module.
