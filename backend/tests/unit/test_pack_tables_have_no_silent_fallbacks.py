"""A new demo pack must not fall out of the hand-maintained tables in silence.

Three tables in ``demo_projects`` are keyed by something a pack file carries,
and every one of them answers a miss with a value that looks like an answer:

* ``_COUNTRY_ISO2`` is keyed by the country name in the pack's address, and a
  miss gives ``""``. That empty string becomes the catalogue row's country and
  the ``country_code`` of every contact the pack seeds, and it is also what
  ``_AUTHORITY_BY_COUNTRY`` and ``_NOTICE_CLAUSE_BY_COUNTRY`` are then looked up
  with, so the correspondence register quietly addresses nobody in particular.
* ``_PACK_DEMO_TYPE`` is keyed by ``demo_id`` and defaults to ``"Commercial"``.
  A default that is itself a valid answer cannot be told apart from a real one:
  a residential building in Shenzhen was listed as commercial from the day it
  shipped, and nobody could have noticed by reading the catalogue.
* ``_DEMO_COST_LEVEL`` is keyed by currency and defaults to ``(1.0, 1.0)``,
  which prices the shared euro-denominated seed literals at German levels. A
  pack in yen or won would seed plausible-looking numbers that are wrong by two
  orders of magnitude, and every one of them would still be a number.

None of the three raises, warns or logs. Boot stays green, the pack installs,
and the only way to find out is to go looking. Six packs written on one day all
landed in the first table at once, which is what prompted this file.

The tests below are deliberately about coverage of the tables, not about the
correctness of any single value. Being present is checkable by a machine; being
right is not.
