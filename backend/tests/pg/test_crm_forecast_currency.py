"""PG: the forecast's two currency columns, against a real cluster and a real row.

Two things the SQLite unit lane cannot say anything about.

The repository is the second drop site
--------------------------------------
``CrmService.compute_and_store_forecast`` builds the row and
``ForecastRepository.upsert`` either inserts it or copies its fields onto the
row already stored for that period. The copy is a hand-written field list, so
a column added to the model and to the create path can still be silently
missing from the refresh - and that failure is worse than the original,
because the row would then carry this run's four scalars beside the previous
run's breakdown, describing two different days with nothing to say so. The
first test recomputes a period whose currencies changed and reads the row
back.

The migration has to land on rows that already exist
----------------------------------------------------
``env.py`` short-circuits a blank database to ``create_all`` plus
``stamp heads``, so "empty database, upgrade head" runs no revision at all and
still reports success. The second test therefore builds the table in its
pre-migration shape, puts a forecast in it, runs v3305's real ``upgrade()``
and checks the row survived with both new columns NULL - which is the claim
the revision's docstring makes and the reason there is no backfill.

Gated by ``OE_TEST_DB=pg`` (see conftest).
