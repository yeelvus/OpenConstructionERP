"""Document activity log - write helpers and read helpers.

The audit log itself is intentionally trivial - there is one writer
(``record_activity``) and one reader (``list_activity``). All callers go
through the helper so the dedupe rule (skip if the same
``(document_id, user_id, action)`` triple fired within the last second)
applies uniformly - duplicate handler invocations on retry must NOT
produce two rows in the timeline.
