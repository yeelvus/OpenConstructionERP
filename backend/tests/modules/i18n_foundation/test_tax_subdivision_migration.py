"""v3307 on the path that actually reaches installs, not the one on paper.

``alembic upgrade head`` is not how most of this platform's databases get a new
column. The embedded-PostgreSQL runtime builds its schema with ``create_all``
and *stamps* alembic rather than running it, then heals later columns out of
the models at boot (``app/core/postgres_migrator.py``). On such an install
``v3307_tax_subdivision.upgrade()`` never executes: the column appears, empty,
and the revision's backfill does not.

What that would cost is the reason this file exists. Every Canadian rate would
be present and none of them labelled, so a lookup for Ontario finds no
provincial rate, sees that Ontario is a province the platform knows, and
concludes "federal only, 5 %" - the wrong total, delivered with exactly the
confidence Alberta's correct 5 % deserves. The resolver therefore withholds the
federal-only claim while any sub-national row is unlabelled, which turns that
into a refusal to answer; the repair below is what turns the refusal into 13 %.
Both halves are asserted here, in that order.

So the backfill exists twice, once in the revision for whoever runs alembic and
once as the ``tax_subdivision_backfill`` entry in ``app/core/data_repairs.py``
for everyone else, and this file covers both halves of that arrangement:

* the two backfill tables are identical, so the duplication cannot drift
* the revision points at the registered repair, and the repair is registered
* the boot-time half repairs the state a healed install is actually left in,
  is idempotent, and never overwrites a value somebody set by hand

The revision's own ``upgrade()`` is not executed here. It is DDL against a
table this fixture already created from the models, so running it would prove
only that ``ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS`` is a no-op. What is worth pinning about
it is that its constraint predicate and the model's are the same sentence, and
that is asserted directly.
