"""Unit vocabulary for Chinese bills of quantities.

A GB/T 50500 bill writes its units as words. ``app.modules.boq.units`` keeps
non-Latin units verbatim rather than folding them to Latin, so those words
reach the validation rules exactly as an estimator typed them - and an
unrecognised unit is skipped, never flagged. A Chinese bill therefore used to
produce no findings rather than wrong ones, which is safe and useless.

These tests pin the three things that were decided when the vocabulary was
extended, because none of them is self-evident from the code:

1. Chinese metric words are in the metric set.
2. Chinese count words are in ``_COUNT_UNITS`` and in NEITHER measurement
   system set. A count of discrete items has no dimension, so it cannot be
   the wrong measurement system; both system sets are only ever read as the
   *wrong* set, and a count unit listed in one would make every count row on
   a project of the other system report a mismatch.
3. The CJK compatibility glyphs are rejected before storage, which is why
   they are deliberately absent from the vocabulary.
