/**
 * The field-time offline queue — a day recorded with no signal, kept on the
 * device until there is signal again.
 *
 * Two ids, and keeping them apart is the whole design:
 *
 *  - `entry_key` names the logical entry, one foreman's record of one
 *    project-day. It is minted once, when the day is first written down, and
 *    every later edit and every replay of that day carries the same key. The
 *    server keys its idempotency ledger on it, so a replay returns the original
 *    timesheet instead of booking the hours twice.
 *  - `clientOpId` names one queued op. It is fresh for every enqueue, because
 *    `MutationQueue.enqueue` dedups on it and *keeps the first op's body*: reuse
 *    the entry key there and the foreman's second edit of the same day would be
 *    swallowed on the device and never sent at all.
 *
 * The queue is transport-agnostic, so this file supplies the piece it cannot
 * know: a sender that carries the desktop JWT. The field PWA's sender
 * (`shared/lib/offline/fieldQueue`) carries a field session token instead and
 * therefore cannot drain these ops, which is why field time has its own queue
 * rather than borrowing that one.
 *
 * Storage is a database of its own, `oe_field_time_offline`. A second object
 * store inside the field PWA's database would never be created on a browser
 * that had already opened it at version 1, and the storage adapter swallows the
 * resulting error — the queue would accept every entry and lose every one.
