# Flagship demo: Grade A commercial office building, City of London (UK)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Elemental cost plan measured per RICS New Rules of Measurement (NRM 2,
# detailed measurement for building works) and structured to the NRM 1 element
# groups used by UK quantity surveyors for elemental cost planning. Pricing is
# at UK cost-index / London Q1 2026 levels in GBP, VAT exclusive. Building Regulations
# (Approved Documents A-S), the Building Safety Act 2022 and CDM 2015 govern
# the works. The Act's dutyholder and competence duties and the reformed
# building control regime apply here; its higher-risk building gateway regime
# does not, because that regime needs at least two residential units as well
# as the height, and a speculative office has none. Both halves of the test
# count, and dropping the residential half is how a commercial tower ends up
# budgeted for a gateway programme it will never go through.
# Structural design to the Eurocodes (BS EN 1990-1998) and BS 8500 concrete.
# Main contract JCT Design and Build 2024 with a two-stage tender. VAT (20%)
# is carried as a separate cumulative markup and never baked into unit rates.
#
# Program: circa 10,500 m2 GIA, NIA approx. 8,400 m2, a 10-storey Grade A
# speculative office over a single-level basement (plant, cycle store, end-of-
# trip facilities). In-situ reinforced-concrete flat-slab frame on a piled
# raft, unitised aluminium curtain walling, BREEAM Outstanding and NABERS UK
# 5-star targets, all-electric with air-source heat pumps and PV. Net Zero
# Carbon in operation aspiration. Headline construction cost circa GBP 42M
# (VAT exclusive).
