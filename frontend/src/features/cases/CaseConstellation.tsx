// CaseConstellation - the specialist and the modules they reach, as one comb.
//
// The case page used to say this in three places that never touched: a
// rectangular photo tile in the hero, a separate card lower down holding the
// module comb, and a meta row that listed the kinds of company as chips while
// a second comb below listed the same kinds of company again. A reader had to
// assemble "this person, working in these modules, for firms like mine" out of
// three blocks that shared no geometry and no adjacency.
//
// This is the hero half of the answer: the portrait becomes a cell, and the
// modules become the cells that TOUCH it. The drawing carries the claim - a
// module is attached to the case because it is attached to the face.
//
// SIX IS THE SHAPE, NOT A BUDGET. A flat-top hexagon has exactly six
// neighbours. Before this was written the catalogue was measured: the most
// modules any of the 202 cases walks through is six, and the spread is 1:2,
// 2:33, 3:86, 4:38, 5:34, 6:9. So the first ring holds every case there is,
// with nothing to truncate and no second ring to draw. `hiveRing` clamps at six
// rather than stacking a seventh cell on top of one of the first six, and the
// caption counts the modules the case actually declares, so a future seventh
// would show up as a caption that disagrees with the drawing instead of as a
// cell silently missing.
//
// WHY THE CELLS DO NOT QUITE TOUCH. Interlocking hexagons already read as
// adjacent, but adjacency alone is a weak claim: a comb of seven cells looks
// like a comb of seven cells, not like one subject and six things it reaches.
// Each cell is drawn slightly inside its slot and the gap that opens is where
// the spokes are drawn, from the middle of the face to the middle of every
// module. The connection is then something the page states rather than
// something the reader has to infer from packing.
//
// The portrait is cut to HEX_CELL_CLIP, not HEX_PORTRAIT_CLIP. Those are
// different hexagons and only the flat-top one tiles with the module cells; a
// pointy-top portrait dropped into this cluster would sit at a right angle to
// its own neighbours. That is a real cost - the portrait crop is the one this
// shape is worse at - so the face is positioned high in its box, the way the
// hero photo already was, and the cell is given the largest size on the page.
