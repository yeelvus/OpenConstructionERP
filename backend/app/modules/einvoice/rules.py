"""EN 16931 business rules, evaluated in Python.

A receiver validates an incoming e-invoice against the EN 16931 Schematron (in
Germany, the KoSIT validator). Every finding it reports carries a rule
identifier such as ``BR-61`` or ``BR-CO-15``, and that identifier, not the
wording, is what the sender has to act on.

This module evaluates the same rules natively. Running a Schematron engine
would mean a JVM or an XSLT processor plus the rule artefacts, which the
platform's 2GB-VPS budget does not have room for; the rules themselves are
small predicates over the semantic model, so they are expressed here directly.
Each one cites the identifier a receiver would report, which keeps our finding
and theirs comparable. This is a well-cited subset, not the full artefact: it
covers the rules an invoice assembled from platform data can actually break.

Identifier namespaces used here:
    * ``BR-*`` / ``BR-CO-*``  EN 16931-1 content and calculation rules
    * ``BR-S-*``, ``BR-Z-*``, ``BR-E-*``, ``BR-AE-*``, ``BR-IC-*``,
      ``BR-G-*``, ``BR-O-*``  the per VAT-category rule families
    * ``BR-DE-*``  XRechnung (KoSIT) national rules
    * ``PEPPOL-EN16931-*``  Peppol BIS Billing 3.0 rules
    * ``OCE-*``  house advisories, warning severity, not part of any standard

# ── currency minor units, per code and on purpose ─────────────────────────────
#
# Two registers publish a digit count per currency and they are not the same
# list, because they answer different questions. ISO 4217 states how a currency
# is subdivided. CLDR states how a person in a locale writes it. Measured
# against ISO 4217 (list-one.xml, Pblshd 2026-01-01) and CLDR 49
# (common/supplemental/supplementalData.xml, the ``<fractions>`` block), they
# part company on fourteen of the codes below.
#
# Two codes are routinely miscounted into that set and are not in it:
#
#   IQD  ISO 3, CLDR 0. A different case entirely: ISO gives the Iraqi dinar
#        three minor digits, and ``_EN16931_MAX_DECIMALS`` trims that to two
#        exactly as it trims KWD. Carried below at 3 so that the cap stays the
#        thing which trims it, rather than the trimming being pre-baked here.
#   PKR  ISO 2, CLDR 2 - no disagreement at all. Only CLDR's *cashDigits* is 0,
#        and that governs rounding banknotes at a till, not a written amount.
#        Expect an instrument to contradict this and do not "correct" it on the
#        strength of one: asking a running engine gives 0 for PKR wherever its
#        bundled ICU is a CLDR release behind, because the digits for this one
#        code changed between releases. The check that tells the two apart is
#        CZK, TWD, DKK, SEK and NOK, which all carry a zero cash rule and all
#        still answer 2 - so an engine answering 0 for PKR is reporting older
#        data, not reading *cashDigits*. Nothing turns on it either way: the
#        value layer and this table both hold 2 for PKR, and only a screen ever
#        asks the engine.
#
# EN 16931 does not settle the remaining fourteen, which is why they need a
# decision recorded rather than derived. Checked against the CEN validation
# artefacts v1.3.16 and the XRechnung (KoSIT) schematron v2.5.0:
#
#   * the BR-DEC-* family is 21 rules and every one of them is a MAXIMUM
#     ("at most two decimals"), tested either as
#     ``string-length(substring-after(amount,'.')) <= 2`` or as
#     ``. = round(. * 100) div 100``. None imposes a minimum and none looks at
#     the currency, so ``1000`` and ``1000.00`` both pass every one of them.
#   * BR-CO-17 and the BR-x-08 family carry a tolerance of one whole currency
#     unit, which a half-unit rounding cannot exceed.
#   * the XRechnung CIUS adds no decimals rule of its own.
#
# So both answers produce a document that validates where we file it, and the
# choice is a question about money rather than about conformance.
#
# Every value here is the value this module already returned before the table
# was written, so recording them changed no document. What changed is that each
# one is now a decision with its reason beside it, instead of a lookup that
# happened to miss and land on the default.

    # a rupiah invoice without sen, in every syntax - CII, UBL and the PDF all
    # read this one function.
    #
    # DECIDED, and decided as zero. This pair carried an "undecided" marker for
    # some time on the reading that ISO says two, CLDR says zero and EN 16931

    # itself: the fillér was withdrawn from circulation in 1999 and the sen is
    # likewise long gone, so neither amount CAN be settled in the subunit ISO
    # still lists. A count of two would not be a more precise forint, it would
    # be two digits that no payment can ever carry.
    #
    # The reading that made it look open was that our resolvers disagreed. They
    # do not. ``app.core.money`` holds zero for both, the screen resolver takes
    # CLDR's zero through the running engine, and this table holds zero: four

# so that nobody reads the silence as coverage:
#
#   BR-DE-1     BG-16 is always written; ``build_einvoice`` never leaves the
#               payment means code empty, so the group cannot be absent.
#   BR-DE-10/11 deliver-to city and post code, conditional on BG-15, which this
#               writer does not emit.
#   BR-DE-14    BT-119 in every VAT breakdown group, already fatal here as the
#               EN 16931 rule BR-48; a German receiver reports the same defect
#               under this identifier.
#   BR-DE-21    the CustomizationID is a constant in ``profiles.py`` and is the
#               value this rule asks for.
#   BR-DE-22    unique attachment filenames; no attachments are embedded.
#   BR-DE-23-b  BG-18 and BG-19 must be absent under a credit transfer, and
#   BR-DE-24-b  neither group is ever written, so each of these holds by
#   BR-DE-25-b  construction rather than by a check.
#   BR-DE-30/31 direct-debit creditor and debited account, inside BG-19.
#
# Out of scope for a different reason: BR-DE-CVD-* apply only to a document
# whose CustomizationID is the Clean Vehicles Directive one, which this platform
# does not issue. BR-DE-12, BR-DE-13 and BR-DE-29 no longer exist in the
# artefact. BR-DE-18 (Skonto notation in BT-20), BR-DE-19/20 (IBAN check digits),
# BR-DE-26 (BG-3 behind a corrected invoice) and BR-DE-TMP-32 (delivery date)
