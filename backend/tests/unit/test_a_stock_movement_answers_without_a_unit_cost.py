"""A stock movement that has no unit cost must still serialize.

``StockMovement.unit_cost`` is nullable on purpose: a movement out of a balance
whose average is not knowable has no unit cost to record, and zero would read as
"issued for nothing". The response schema declared it required, so the three
routes that return a movement raised a ``ValidationError`` instead of an answer.
The database write had already succeeded by then, so the operator saw a 500 over
a movement that was in fact recorded.

The second test pins the currency. ``StockMovement`` carries the ISO code the
unit cost is denominated in and the service writes it on every path, but the
response dropped the field, so the number reached the caller with nothing saying
what it was denominated in. The sibling ``StockBalanceResponse`` carries both.
