"""Shared fixtures for the Teams test suite.

Placed under ``tests/unit`` rather than ``tests/modules`` on purpose. This is an
access-control module, and ``tests/unit`` is what the sharded CI gate actually
runs (``.github/workflows/ci.yml`` lines 131 and 377); ``tests/modules`` runs
only in the chronically-red "CI" job, which is not a gate. A negative
access-control case that nothing gates is only half a proof.

The session fixture runs against the shared PostgreSQL unit database from
``tests/_pg.py``, inside an outer transaction that is rolled back on teardown.
Foreign keys stay ON: the module's guards resolve real ``User`` and ``Project``
rows, and the delete cascade under test is a real FK chain.

The module's validation rules are registered here. The application
registers them from its ``on_startup`` hook, which no test process runs, so
without this the ``teams`` rule set resolves to zero rules and the engine
reports it as ``unsupported`` - which is indistinguishable from "the rules ran
and found nothing".
