"""Demo seed data must not name real trading companies or design practices.

``scripts/check_no_brand_tokens.py`` is the repo-wide gate for this, and it
deliberately cannot express three kinds of name. Its docstring states the
constraint it is protecting: the gate must never fire on an unrelated word, so
tokens that are also ordinary English are left out and handled by review. On top
of that it has a five character floor, and it hashes one maximal ``[a-z0-9]+``
run at a time, so it has no way to describe a brand that is two ordinary words
side by side.

Real firms reached users through exactly those three holes. A four letter
contractor name is under the floor. A practice whose name is also an English
verb is in the excluded class. A developer named after a London dock is two
common nouns. All three shipped in every wheel up to 14.2.1, in
``app/scripts/seed_demo_4d5d.py`` and ``app/scripts/seed_demo_estimates.py``,
because the demo sweep that cleaned ``core/demo_packs`` never reached the
sibling ``app/scripts`` directory.

This test closes those holes without weakening the repo-wide gate, by narrowing
the surface instead of the pattern. It reads only demo seed sources, so a token
that would be ambiguous across the whole repository is far less ambiguous here.
That is what lets the floor drop to four characters and lets ordinary words and
two-word phrases be named.

**The surface is narrow, not prose-free, and the difference matters when you
add a hash.** Contact and bidder rows are the shape this test was built for, but
``core/demo_packs`` also holds hand-authored BOQ tables carrying position
descriptions, tax notes and scope text, which is prose by any measure. Twenty
six of those thirty one packs are excluded from ``ruff format`` for exactly that
reason, see ``[tool.ruff.format]`` in ``pyproject.toml``. Measured 2026-08-03
across the 74 scanned files: 132 397 tokens inside the length window and 144 427
adjacent word pairs, of which the packs contribute 61 801 pairs. So an ordinary
English word, or two ordinary words that also read as a sentence fragment, has a
real chance of appearing here innocently.

That is a cost to pay knowingly rather than a reason to drop the packs. The one
real firm this test's denylist has caught in shipped data, a contractor in a
sitework tender, was in ``demo_packs/condo-toronto.py``. Dropping the packs
would remove the highest-yield surface to protect against a failure that is
loud, located and one line to fix.

Before adding a hash for anything that is also ordinary English, grep the
lowercased string across the scanned set and confirm it does not already occur
as text. A hash that fires on a BOQ description is a false positive nobody can
diagnose, because the literal is not in the file to compare against.

**Two further shapes were unrecordable until 2026-08-06, and one of them had
already leaked.** Both regexes below are ASCII: ``[a-z0-9]+`` and ``[a-z]+``
yield *nothing at all* on a Chinese, Japanese or Korean name, and nothing usable
on a Turkish one, because ``ı`` and ``ş`` are outside the class. So a state
contractor written in Han characters could be deleted from the data but not
remembered, which is the exact failure the denylist exists to prevent. CJK also
has no spaces, so a wider tokeniser is not the answer. ``_DENY_SUBSTRINGS``
tests containment inside each run of such a script instead. Containment is the
blunt instrument here and is used deliberately: a four character Han sequence is
far less likely to occur innocently than an English word, and the one near miss
we know of is real, so read the note on that set before adding to it.

A Latin-script name that carries an accent, a dotless i or a dotted capital I
is shredded by the same two ASCII regexes and belongs in the token or phrase
set, hashed as the fragment the regex actually yields rather than as the name a
reader sees. Three are recorded that way below. Print the ``findall`` output
before you hash anything of that shape, or the entry will be green forever.

**The surface also now includes the locale example values.** A placeholder's
whole job is to show a plausible example, which is how a national contractor
gets typed into one. Nothing had ever checked those files: they held live firms
in fourteen languages, including a Fortune Global 500 state contractor and two
national champions, until 2026-08-06. Only lines carrying a ``_placeholder`` key
are read, not whole locale files, which keeps the prose out.

Brand-safe by the same construction as the gate: only SHA-256 of the lowercased
token or phrase is stored, never the literal string, so this file does not put a
brand name in the repo and does not itself trip the repo-wide gate.

To extend, add a hash::

    python -c "import hashlib;print(hashlib.sha256(b'<lowercased>').hexdigest())"
