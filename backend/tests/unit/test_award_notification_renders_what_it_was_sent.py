"""The award notification renders the values its publisher actually sent.

A subscriber that reads a key its publisher does not emit says nothing about
it. ``str(data.get("award_amount") or "")`` yields an empty string, the
notification is delivered anyway, and the only place the fault is visible is
the sentence a person eventually reads: an award notice with a blank where the
money should be. No exception, no log line, nothing red.

This pins the pairing rather than either side of it, because each side is
correct alone. The publisher's half is asserted in
``test_bid_management.test_the_award_payload_carries_what_its_notification_subscriber_reads``;
the payload used here is that same published contract, written out so the two
tests fail for different reasons when they fail.

Note what is deliberately NOT here: ``winner_user_id``. A ``Bidder`` is an
external company with no user id in the schema, so the winning bidder is not
reachable through in-app notifications and the handler resolves two recipients
rather than three. See the note on ``_on_bid_awarded``.
