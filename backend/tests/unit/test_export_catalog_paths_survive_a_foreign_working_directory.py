"""The catalog export must name the same two files from any working directory.

``app.scripts.export_full_catalog`` used to build both its input and its output
path on ``os.getcwd()``, so the same command read and wrote a different tree
depending on where the operator happened to stand. Run from ``backend/`` it
worked; run from the repository root the read failed; run from a directory two
levels under a sibling checkout the read succeeded and the export landed in
somebody else's tree.

Every assertion here therefore runs from a working directory that is NOT the
repository root, and the important ones run from TWO such directories: a single
foreign directory cannot tell an anchored path from a differently broken one,
because both are simply "not where I am standing".

The resolvers are called directly rather than through :func:`main`, on purpose.
``main`` needs a private parquet tree that does not exist on CI, and it
overwrites version-controlled files under ``data/catalog`` - a test must not do
either. What is under test is where the paths point, and that is the resolvers.
