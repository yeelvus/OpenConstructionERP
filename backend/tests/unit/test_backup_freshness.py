"""The backup guard complains about the artefact, not about the run.

Production went nine days with no database dump and nothing said so. The job
was refusing correctly and writing that refusal to a log nobody reads, so the
missing alarm got read as evidence the backup had run.

The test that matters here is not "a fresh backup passes". That case proves
nothing, because a guard that returns 0 unconditionally also passes it. What
has to be proved is that every shape of "we cannot restore" comes back
non-zero, including the two that a failure-watcher never sees:

  * the job stopped being scheduled, so the directory is empty or gone and no
    failure event was ever emitted;
  * the dump died part-way through, so the newest file has a current mtime and
    a pure age check waves it past.

And the shape this codebase keeps getting wrong: "cannot tell" must not be
success. An unreadable directory is a fact about the reader, not about the
backup, and it exits 2 rather than 0.
