/**
 * ProjectFilePicker - open a file that is ALREADY in the project, instead of
 * re-uploading the same drawing from disk.
 *
 * Every viewer/takeoff module used to offer a local upload only. If the
 * drawing had already been filed in the project, the user had to find it on
 * their own machine again, and the project ended up with two copies of it.
 * This picker lists the stored files the calling module can actually open,
 * filtered by the module's own declared formats.
 *
 * The module declares what it opens; the pure matcher in
 * ``shared/lib/projectFileFormats`` decides what qualifies. Formats that only
 * become viewable after the DDC cad2data conversion (RVT, IFC) are shown with
 * a "needs conversion" note rather than being offered as an instant open, and
 * formats that another module handles (DWG in the BIM viewer) say so. Nothing
 * is offered that would silently fail to load.
 *
 * TWO SOURCES, ONE DIALOG. "Project files" is not one store. The documents
 * module has its filing cabinet, and a viewer module can have its own - PDF
 * takeoff keeps sheets in ``oe_takeoff_document``, where an uploaded or seeded
 * plan exists and nowhere else. A dialog that promised "project files" and
 * listed only the documents module told the user something false: a plan open
 * in that very module could not be found in it by name. Passing
 * ``moduleKinds`` federates the sources - one project-scoped,
 * permission-checked, paged request to the file manager, grouped by the module
 * each row came from and named on screen. Narrowing the label instead would
 * have made the sentence true and the feature useless.
 *
 * The federation is server-side on purpose. Merging two paginated listings in
 * the browser would search page one of each and call the result "the project".
 *
 * This ADDS a way to open a file. Every caller keeps its local-upload path.
