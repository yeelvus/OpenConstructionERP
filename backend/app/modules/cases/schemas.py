"""Cases Pydantic schemas - request/response models.

The step shape mirrors ``PlaybookStep`` in
``frontend/src/features/cases/types.ts`` with one deliberate difference: a
shipped playbook carries ``titleKey`` + ``titleDefault`` because its text is
translated into 29 locales at build time, while an authored case carries plain
text because the author writes it in their own language and nobody translates
it afterwards. The reader renders a key when there is one and the literal when
there is not, so both kinds run through the same component.

# A step's ``to`` becomes an href in the reader. Only an in-app path is ever a
# legitimate value, so the field is restricted to one rather than sanitised
# afterwards: a leading single slash, then path characters, then an optional
# query. This rejects ``javascript:`` and friends by construction, and it also
# rejects ``//evil.example/x``, which a naive "must start with /" check lets
# straight through as a protocol-relative URL to another host.
#
# ``.`` is allowed inside a segment because a route may legitimately carry one,
# but a ``..`` segment is rejected separately below. The character class alone
# does not catch it: ``/../admin`` matches this pattern happily, and a router
# that normalises the path would then land somewhere the author never named.
#
# ``:`` is allowed because the shipped cases use route parameters - a third of
# them step through ``/projects/:projectId/files`` and the reader substitutes
# the active project at run time. Without it, copying one of the product's own
# cases produced a case the product refused to save. It costs nothing here:
# the leading slash is mandatory and unescapable, so ``javascript:`` cannot
# match this pattern with or without the colon in the class.
