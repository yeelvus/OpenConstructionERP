"""PG: the currency backfill keeps what it filled when the migration is interrupted.

``v3273_backfill_cost_item_currency`` rewrites potentially every row of
``oe_costs_item``. Alembic runs an entire upgrade inside one transaction, so the
first shape of that revision needed peak disk for the whole table rewritten at
once, and when it ran out on a real database the abort took every region that
had already succeeded with it. The predicate reads as resumable and inside one
transaction it is not: each retry started from zero and needed the same peak, so
freeing a little space and trying again could never finish.

The fix commits in chunks on a connection of its own. **That claim is what these
tests pin, and the size of the table is not how you check it.** A fixture small
enough to run in CI completes under either implementation, so asserting "the
rows came out filled" would pass on the code that failed in the field and prove
nothing. What separates the two is durability, not throughput, so the central
test below rolls the migration's own transaction back and asserts the fill
survived it. Old code: rollback undoes everything, exactly as it did on the real
database. New code: the rows were committed by a second connection the rollback
cannot reach. That distinction holds at three rows and at three million.

The peak these chunks are sized for is stated in the revision and is a property
of a 1724 MB table; verifying the number itself needs that table and belongs on
a real database, not here.

These tests genuinely commit, so they cannot use ``pg_session`` (which isolates
by rolling back and would hide the very thing under test, besides being
invisible to a second connection). They build a synchronous engine the way
``env.py`` does in production, tag every row they write with a unique ``source``
and delete those rows afterwards.

Gated by ``OE_TEST_DB=pg`` (see conftest).
