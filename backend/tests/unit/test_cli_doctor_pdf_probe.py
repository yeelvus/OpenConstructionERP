"""The doctor's PDF probe must import the way the upload path imports.

The probe spawns ``sys.executable -c "import <mod>"`` so a broken native
extension takes down a child instead of the diagnostic. That is right for a
normal install and wrong for the frozen desktop build, where ``sys.executable``
is the app binary and ``-c`` reaches the app's own CLI. Without the desktop
arm every healthy desktop install would be reported as a broken PDF reader.
