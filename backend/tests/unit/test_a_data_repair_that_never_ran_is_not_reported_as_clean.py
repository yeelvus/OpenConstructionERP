"""``/api/health`` says whether the boot-time data repairs ran, in three states.

The field beside this one, ``schema_heal_failed``, answers for the SCHEMA half
of an upgrade. Until ``data_repairs_failed`` existed there was no answer for the
other half at all, and the field that looks like one lies about it:
``alembic_head_matches`` reports ``true`` on a database whose data rewrites
never executed, because the boot path stamps head from ``create_all`` and a
revision's ``upgrade()`` body is never run. A monitor reading that payload had
no way to tell a database whose row-level corrections landed from one where they
did not.

Three states, and they are three, for the same reason the two fields above it
have three. ``true`` at least one repair raised, ``false`` every repair
completed, ``null`` the pass never ran. ``null`` is where a deployment whose
database is not PostgreSQL stays for its whole life, because the repair pass
sits inside the same ``if "postgresql" in settings.database_url`` branch the
heal does. Reporting that as ``false`` would say "all repairs completed" about
a pass that never happened, which is exactly the substitution these fields exist
to stop making.

The polarity matches ``schema_heal_failed`` and is the inverse of
``alembic_head_matches``: here ``true`` is the bad news, which is why the
endpoint reads it with ``is True`` rather than as a truth value. ``null`` is not
a fault and must not degrade the status.
