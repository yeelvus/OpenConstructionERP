"""The categorical config-syntax gate has to be able to fail.

scripts/check_config_file_syntax.py parses every tracked YAML and JSON file. A
gate whose good outcome is an empty list is worth nothing until it has been
shown finding something, so this plants a broken file of each kind and requires
the refusal, then requires the real tree to be clean.

The gate exists for the category, not for the files. Both kinds are already
parsed in plenty of places, five unit tests over the workflows and 25 scripts
over the JSON trees they own, but every one of those readers is addressed at a
named file or a single directory, so a malformed file written anywhere else is
read by nothing. For a workflow that is the quiet failure rather than the loud
one: GitHub declines to run a workflow it cannot parse and reports nothing.
