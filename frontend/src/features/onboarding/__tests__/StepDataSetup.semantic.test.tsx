// The card's own tests cover what the card says. These cover the wiring around
// it, which is a different thing and was covered by nothing: the step decides
// whether to ask the server for the encoder at all, and it decides using a
// value seeded from the deployment.
//
// Only two behaviours are worth pinning here, because only these two regress
// silently. A tick hardcoded to on looks identical on screen to a tick seeded
// from a server that said on, and the difference only shows on a server
// deployment, where it starts a download nobody asked for. And a request fired
// on a model that has already been requested is invisible too, because the
// second request succeeds just as quietly as the first.
//
// Two things are deliberately not mocked. react-i18next stays real: mocking it
// proves a defaultValue is spelled correctly and proves nothing about what a
// reader sees, since a key that exists in en.ts never reaches its fallback. And
// the api modules are spread from the real ones with importOriginal rather than
// replaced, so anything the step reaches beyond the two network calls stubbed
// here keeps working instead of arriving undefined.
