"""Five endpoints a stranger could call, and what each of them gave away.

A per-route pass over the live router tree found four routes with no gate of
any kind plus one install route gated on authentication alone. They are not
one defect: two disclosed an absolute server path, one spawned a process for a
caller who had not logged in, one wrote a service binary to the host, and one
was a capability URL by accident. Each is pinned here.

The two disclosure tests assert the server directory string is ABSENT from the
serialised body rather than asserting the shape of what remains. A projection
that kept the value under a different key would pass a key-absence test and
still leak, and a projection that dropped a field the UI needs would pass a
shape test and still break the page - so both properties are checked.
