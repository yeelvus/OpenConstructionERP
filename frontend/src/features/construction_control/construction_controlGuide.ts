// constructionControlGuide - "How it works" content for the Construction
// Control (QA/QC) module. Consumed by
// <ModuleGuideButton content={constructionControlGuide} /> on
// ConstructionControlPage.
//
// i18n: every key carries its inline English default and is read via
// t(key, { defaultValue }). The keys are not in en.ts, the inline defaults
// are the English source; their translations live in the other locale files,
// so a changed default needs its translations redone too.
//
// Spotlight selectors point at the page's five pillar tabs. The TabBar is
// rendered with testIdPrefix="cc", so each tab exposes a stable
// data-testid="cc-tab-<id>" that survives styling churn. When no project is
// selected the tabs are not on screen and the card simply centres itself.
