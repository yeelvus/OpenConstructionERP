"""The version the CLI prints has to be a version, and it has to be this tree's.

``_resolve_version`` reads the ``Settings`` field first and falls back to
``importlib.metadata`` when that raises. It was the other way round until
41bc99c00, and the order matters: metadata reports whatever distribution is
installed in the environment, so a source checkout with any earlier
``pip install openconstructionerp`` beside it printed the installed version
while ``/api/health`` on the same interpreter printed the running one.

The Settings branch reads ``Settings.model_fields["app_version"]``, and
``app_version`` is declared with ``default_factory``, so pydantic keeps
``PydanticUndefined`` in ``default`` and there is no ``default`` to read.

``PydanticUndefined`` is an object with a ``__str__``, which is what made this
survive. Nothing raised, so the ``except`` below it never ran and the value
never became "unknown". The line printed to the user was

    OpenConstructionERP vPydanticUndefined

on the one code path that only ever runs when somebody is already trying to
work out what they have installed.

What this file asserts, and the limit of it. It drives each branch by making
the other one raise, which is a stand in for the real causes rather than the
causes themselves, and it cannot prove the frozen build takes the metadata
branch. What it can do is fail the day either branch stops naming a version,
and fail the day the order goes back.

The order is checked by driving the two sources apart rather than by comparing
them. Comparing them was the earlier form of the control here, and it could
only ever pass: a CI runner installs the package from the tree it just checked
out, so both sources answer the same and a resolver reading either one agrees
with both. It went red for the first time on a developer machine whose
environment still held an older editable install, which is precisely the
situation 41bc99c00 exists for, and what it convicted there was the correct
behaviour.
