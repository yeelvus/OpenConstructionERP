/**
 * partnerPackVocabulary — merge a partner pack's own locale file over the app's.
 *
 * A pack ships more than a language preference. It ships the words its market
 * actually uses: uk-jct calls the coordination screen a "Coordination Centre",
 * batimatech-ca calls the bill of quantities a "Bordereau de quantités" rather
 * than the metropolitan-French "Devis quantitatif". Those strings live in JSON
 * files inside the pack and the backend streams them from
 * ``/api/v1/partner-pack/locale/{code}``. Nothing ever fetched that endpoint,
 * so every one of those files was dead on disk.
 *
 * Two codes are in play and they are NOT the same code, which is the whole
 * reason this is a separate module from the language switch:
 *
 * - the **pack locale code** (``fr-CA``, ``en-GB``, ``pt``) is a key of the
 *   manifest's ``additional_locales`` map and the only thing the endpoint
 *   answers to. Fetch with this.
 * - the **UI language** is what ``normalizePackLocale`` resolves that code to
 *   (``fr-CA`` -> ``fr``, because there is no ``fr-CA`` in
 *   ``SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES``). Merge into this.
 *
 * Collapsing the two is what kills the feature: fetching ``/locale/fr`` for
 * batimatech-ca 404s, and merging ``fr-CA`` strings into a nonexistent ``fr-CA``
 * bundle renders nothing. The normalization itself is correct and stays —
 * a pack that names a region the UI does not ship must still inherit the base
 * language.
 *
 * The overlay follows the *current* language rather than the one forced at
 * activation. india-cpwd declares ``default_locale: "en"`` and ships only
 * ``hi``; batimatech-ca ships ``fr-CA`` and ``en-CA``. Under an
 * apply-once-at-activation model neither pack's second file could ever load.
