# DDC-CWICR-OE: DataDrivenConstruction · OpenConstructionERP
"""FastAPI router for the BI Dashboards module.

Mounted by the module loader at ``/api/v1/bi-dashboards/``.

Security model (v3.0.x IDOR sweep):

* **KPI endpoints** (compute / history / drill-down): if a ``project_id``
  is supplied in the body or query, the caller must own that project
  (``verify_project_access``). Project-less (portfolio) calls are scoped to
  the caller's accessible projects via ``accessible_project_ids`` and the
  ``allowed_project_ids`` set threaded into the KPI layer: a non-admin only
  ever aggregates over projects they own or are a team member of, while an
  admin (helper returns ``None``) keeps the tenant-wide portfolio view. An
  empty accessible set yields empty/zero, never every project.
* **Dashboards / Widgets / Reports / Schedules / Saved Filters**: these
  belong to a single user (``owner_user_id``). We enforce ownership
  inline: load the object, compare ``owner_user_id`` to the current user,
  raise 404 on mismatch (404 not 403 to avoid leaking existence). Widgets
  and schedules inherit ownership from their parent (dashboard / report).
* **Project dimension** (v14.9): each of those assets also carries a
  nullable ``project_id`` whose NULL means company-wide. The list
  endpoints accept an optional ``project_id`` so the project route
  ``/projects/{id}/bi-dashboards`` answers for the project in the address
  bar instead of quietly rendering the company-wide page; the answer is
  the project's own rows plus the company-wide ones. Naming a project
  requires access to it (``verify_project_access``), on reads and on
  writes alike, so the new column cannot be used to pin an asset to
  someone else's project. Ownership is unchanged either way - a project
  never widens who sees what.
* **Alerts are outside that dimension.** ``AlertRule`` has carried its own
  ``scope_project_id`` since before this, with its own audience rules, and
  ``GET /alerts`` still answers by what the caller can access rather than
  by the project in the address bar. Bringing that endpoint in line is a
  separate change: it would narrow who is notified, which is a decision
  about alerting rather than about routing.
