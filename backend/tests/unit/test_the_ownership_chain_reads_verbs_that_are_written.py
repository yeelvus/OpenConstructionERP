"""The ownership chain reads two activity-log verbs. Something must write them.

Two services reconstruct who held a change record and when, and both do it by
selecting activity rows whose ``action`` is one of two verbs. Each declares
those verbs as its own private constant, and each says in a comment that they
are kept in sync with the write side. ``core/audit_log.py`` makes the same
claim from the other end: "it must match on both the write and the read side."
Three claims, no mechanism.

The failure is silent and it is in a feature whose whole point is evidence. If
a writer stops emitting one of these verbs - renamed in a refactor, or a new
change family that never learned to write it - the select simply matches fewer
rows. No exception, no empty-result branch, no log line. The chain comes back
shorter, the provability score comes back lower, and both look like a record
that was genuinely never handed off. A claim that cannot be disproved by its
own history is exactly what a claims-evidence module must not produce.

Two things are checked, because the claim has two halves. The hand-off verb has
a real source of truth in core and the readers merely copy it, so that half is
an equality. The status verb has no constant anywhere - it is a bare literal at
roughly forty write sites - so that half is checked per module, against the
three services whose records the chain actually resolves.

The limit is written down rather than left to be discovered: a verb renamed at
every write site in one module fails here, and a verb renamed at one of that
module's several write sites does not. The per-module granularity is chosen
because that is the granularity at which the damage appears - one change
family quietly losing its status segments while the others keep theirs.
