// Case: "Close out from substantial performance to the final account" (CA).
//
// The objection is "closeout is a legal matter, not a software matter", and it
// is half right. Closeout IS a legal matter, and a legal matter with four dated
// consequences hanging off one certified date is exactly the shape software is
// for. Quebec is named as a contrast rather than folded in: there is no
// statutory holdback of this kind there and the security is a legal hypothec,
// which must never be called a lien. Content strings are key plus inline
// English default and live only here.

    "Substantial performance is one date with a tree of consequences under it. It starts a publication deadline, it starts the period during which security can still be claimed against the project, it makes the holdback releasable, and it fixes the point deficiencies are reckoned from. Most firms track those four in four places and reconcile them from memory, which works until the month somebody is away. Quebec is genuinely different rather than differently worded: there is no statutory holdback of this kind, and the security is a legal hypothec whose notice must be registered in the land register within 30 days following the end of the work and served on the owner, with no extension and no exception, where the end of the work means the work called for in the plans and specifications is complete and not that the minor deficiencies have been corrected. Calling that mechanism a lien is the fastest way to tell a Quebec client you have not worked there.",
