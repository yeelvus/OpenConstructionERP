"""A requirement governs work, plural, and both writers have to agree on that.

``link_to_position`` predates the link table. It writes ``linked_position_id``,
one column, so linking position A and then position B leaves the requirement
naming B and nothing at all remembering A. That was defensible while one column
was the whole answer. It stopped being defensible the moment
``linked_position_ids`` started reporting every position a requirement governs,
because then the route quietly loses data the model claims to hold.

The two writers therefore have to maintain the same two representations. The
column keeps its meaning, the most recently linked position, and the link table
accumulates. These tests hold both writers to that, in both orders, and check
that unlinking is not confused by a requirement that arrived through the old
route and was migrated into the new table.

Pattern: PostgreSQL transaction-isolated session, FK enforcement off, same as
the neighbouring matrix tests.
