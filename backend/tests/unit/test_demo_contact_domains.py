"""A demo contact must carry a domain a resolver could actually use.

The German demo packs name their firms properly, umlauts and all, and the
addresses were written the same way: ``vergabe@sommerfeld-kältetechnik.de``.
A domain label cannot carry an umlaut on the wire. It has to be punycode, and
punycode on a screen reads as line noise, so the spelling a German firm
actually registers is the transliterated one. Twenty addresses across four
files were written the unusable way and read on camera as typos.

The name is not the address. ``Sommerfeld Kältetechnik GmbH`` keeps its
umlauts here and must keep them; only the part after the ``@`` is constrained,
which is why this reads the two spans separately rather than banning non-ASCII
from the file.

A source scan rather than a seeded database: the demo writers outnumber the
seeders any suite executes, so most of this data has no runtime coverage and
reading the source is the only thing that sees all of it.
