"""The guard that stops a module writing uploads next to whatever directory it was started in.

A module that declares ``ATTACHMENTS_DIR = Path("uploads/rfi/attachments")`` has
not chosen a directory. It has chosen whatever the process happened to be
started in, and every deployment starts the process somewhere different. Under
``make dev-backend`` that is the repo root and the files look fine. Under a
per-machine Windows install the Start Menu shortcut starts the app in the
install folder beneath Program Files, where an unelevated user cannot create a
directory at all, so the first ``mkdir`` raises ``PermissionError`` and
attaching a file to an RFI answers a bare 500 with no message a user can act
on. Between those two extremes sits the quieter failure: a service restarted
from a different directory writes new attachments somewhere the old ones are
not, and nothing anywhere reports that the files split into two piles.

The platform already resolves this centrally. ``app.core.storage.resolve_data_dir``
honours ``OE_DATA_DIR`` > ``DATA_DIR`` > ``OE_CLI_DATA_DIR`` and falls back to a
location that is persistent for the install shape it finds itself in, and the
desktop CLI exports ``OE_CLI_DATA_DIR`` before anything under ``app`` is
imported. Modules reach it through ``module_uploads_dir`` / ``module_data_dir``.
Nothing forced them to, which is why ten modules did not.

This guard is a ratchet on the class, not a list of the nineteen sites that had
it. The rule it enforces is mechanical: a relative string literal must not
become a directory the platform writes blobs into. Two shapes count as that.
A ``Path("...")`` whose first segment names one of the platform's own blob
directories is one, because those names only ever appear at the top of a write
root. An ``os.makedirs`` or ``.mkdir()`` applied straight to a relative literal
is the other, because creating a directory is itself the proof it is a write
root, whatever it is called.

Both halves matter. Without the first, a module can declare the root far from
where it creates it and the guard sees only an innocent-looking constant.
Without the second, a module can invent a blob directory under a name this file
has never heard of. Neither half needs a per-file exception list, which is the
point: ``boq/cad_import.py`` may keep ``Path("converters/bin")`` because a
read-only search path for an external binary is neither shape, not because
somebody blessed that line number. An exclusion list nobody can re-derive is
the thing that rots, and the ratchet it protects rots with it.

The scanner is asserted against the live tree, and reports how many files it
read. A tree walk that visits nothing and prints OK is indistinguishable from a
tree walk that found nothing wrong, and this repository has shipped that mistake
before.
