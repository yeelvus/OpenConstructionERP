"""Deliver work calendars added to the seed file after this database was seeded.

``_seed_work_calendars`` fills ``oe_i18n_work_calendar`` only while the table is
empty - ``seed.py`` returns at the row count before it opens the file - so every
calendar added to ``work_calendars.json`` since an install was built is a
calendar that install will never receive. The file has grown six countries since
its first release: Bulgaria and Nigeria, then Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain and Oman.

What that costs is not a missing row but a wrong answer.
:func:`~app.modules.i18n_foundation.service.get_working_days` falls back to
``{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}`` when a country has no calendar, so a schedule drawn in Doha
or Kuwait City is not refused for want of data - it is answered, in confident
Monday-to-Friday, which puts every deadline on the wrong day twice a week and
looks exactly like a correct answer on screen. That is the same shape as the
four-day Saudi week ``v3303`` exists to repair, reached by a different road: not
a row saying the wrong thing, a row that is not there at all.

Why this is a boot-path repair and not a migration
--------------------------------------------------
The natural place for this is an ``upgrade()`` body beside ``v3303``, and it
would not run. :mod:`app.core.data_repairs` states it at the top: the product
does not run ``alembic upgrade``. Schema moves at boot through
``postgres_auto_migrate`` and ``Base.metadata.create_all``, which carry additive
schema revisions and nothing else, so a revision whose body rewrites rows never
executes on an install brought up the normal way - while
``stamp_head_if_unstamped`` records that database at head, so the rewrite did
not run *and* the version table says it did. ``v3303`` carries a
``# boot-repair: gap`` line saying exactly that of itself. A second migration
here would reproduce that half-fix on the very population it is meant to serve,
so the delivery lives here instead.

Which installations this repairs, and which it does not
-------------------------------------------------------
It repairs an install whose work calendar table was seeded before a country's
calendar shipped, and which has no calendar for that country now. That is the
whole population that has been silently answering Monday-to-Friday for the Gulf.

It does nothing on four kinds of install, three of them deliberate:

* A fresh one, on either side of the seeder. Afterwards the table holds the
  current file, so there is nothing to add. Before it the table is empty - and
  on a first boot that is the ordinary case rather than a corner, because the
  repair registry runs well ahead of ``seed_i18n_data`` in ``app.main``. An
  empty table is not a database whose seed cannot be dated, it is one that has
  not been seeded, and ``_seed_work_calendars`` fills it later in this same
  boot. Either way this returns 0 and says nothing.
* One that already has a calendar for the country. Somebody may have edited
  their Qatar week, and a reconciler that overwrites it is worse than the gap it
  closes. Their row stands, untouched, whatever it says.
* One seeded *after* the calendar shipped and missing it anyway. The row was
  removed, that was a decision, and a boot-path repair does not get to reverse a
  decision. Told apart from the case above by dating the seed - see
  :func:`anchor_countries`.
* One that holds calendars but none of the ones that date a seed, so when it
  was seeded cannot be told. Nothing is delivered and a warning says why,
  because the question this repair has to answer is not "is the row missing"
  but "was it ever delivered", and on that database there is no evidence either
  way. Holding calendars is what separates it from the empty table above: there
  the seeder is about to answer, so telling the user to add the rows by hand
  would be false.

It also does not repair Saudi Arabia, and that is worth saying plainly because
the paragraph above invites the opposite reading. An install seeded before
commit ``0d2632c3d`` holds SA as ``[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`` - a Monday-zero week in the
ISO column - and ``isoweekday()`` never returns 0, so it counts a four-day week
to this day. ``v3303`` would repair it and does not run. This repair cannot:
Saudi Arabia *has* a row, so the guard above declines it, and a
``never_delivered`` repair is forbidden to touch an existing row at all. Closing
that one needs a second repair of nature ``always_wrong``, which does not exist
yet.

Adding a calendar to ``work_calendars.json`` means adding it to
:data:`CALENDAR_FIRST_SHIPPED` too, or it silently joins the anchors and is
never delivered to anybody.
