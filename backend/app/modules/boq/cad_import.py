# ── Automatic converter provisioning (zero-user-action download) ──────────
#
# Why this exists: ``find_converter`` only LOCATES an already-present
# binary. Historically the user had to install the converter manually
# (via the BIM/Quantities page Install button, which calls
# ``takeoff.router.install_converter``) before any .rvt/.ifc/.dwg/.dgn
# upload could be converted. ``ensure_converter`` closes that gap: when a
# conversion is requested and the converter is missing, it downloads and
# extracts it automatically, then returns the resolved exe path - no user
# action required.
#
# The actual download is delegated to the SAME hardened routine the
# Install endpoint uses (``takeoff.router._download_converter_files_windows``)
# so there is exactly one place that talks to the network, applies the
# host allow-list / size caps, verifies the PE header, and rolls back a
# partial download. ``ensure_converter`` adds the missing pieces on top:
#   * a per-format file lock so two simultaneous uploads don't both kick
#     off a download into the same directory (idempotent under concurrency),
#   * double-checked resolution (re-probe inside the lock),
#   * graceful, non-crashing failure on non-Windows platforms.

# Download source is centralised in ``takeoff.router`` (``_DDC_REPO`` /
# ``_DDC_BRANCH``, both env-overridable via ``OE_CONVERTER_REPO`` /
# ``OE_CONVERTER_BRANCH``). We surface the canonical base-URL env name
# here too so this module documents the single knob an operator turns to
# point the auto-installer somewhere else.

# the RVT (RvtExporter) converter, .dxf by the DWG (DwgExporter)
# converter. ``ensure_converter`` resolves through this so an upload of an
# alias provisions and runs the binary that actually reads it.
#
# The .dxf entry is now only about WHICH BINARY reads a DXF if one is being
# used at all. It is no longer the route a DXF upload takes: ``dxf_native``
# reads the drawing in-process, and ``convert_cad_to_excel`` sends it there

    """Resolve a CAD/BIM converter, downloading it automatically if missing.

    This is the single entry point the conversion path calls before
    invoking a converter binary. Behaviour:

    1. If the converter for ``fmt`` is already present (``find_converter``
       resolves it), return its path immediately - no network IO.
    2. On Windows, acquire a per-format install lock, re-check (so two
       concurrent uploads do not both download), and otherwise delegate to
       the hardened downloader that mirrors the upstream repo directory
       into ``~/.openestimator/converters/{fmt}_windows/``. The downloader
       verifies the extracted ``*Exporter.exe`` is a valid PE and rolls
       back a partial download on failure. The freshly installed path is
       then re-resolved through ``find_converter`` and returned.
    3. On non-Windows platforms the bundled binaries do not run, so this
       raises :class:`ConverterUnavailableError` with the platform-correct
       install instructions instead of crashing.

    Args:
        fmt: Lowercase format key without dot - one of ``rvt`` / ``ifc`` /
            ``dwg`` / ``dgn``. Aliases (``rfa`` → ``rvt``, ``dxf`` → ``dwg``)
            are normalised by the caller; this function expects a key that
            exists in :data:`CONVERTERS`.

    Returns:
        Absolute path to a present, runnable converter executable.

    Raises:
        ConverterUnavailableError: The converter is missing and could not

# a depth-mode token (``standard`` / ``complete``) and the ``-no-collada``
# flag we use to skip the geometry pass.

# unconditionally - which produces a ``The following arguments were not
# expected`` failure on old binaries even though they could otherwise
# convert the file just fine.  This matrix records what each installed
# binary actually understands so ``ifc_processor._run_ddc`` can build a
# version-tolerant command line.
#
# Cache key is the resolved binary path (str), so a user with two
# extensions sharing the same install dir gets one probe per binary.  We
# also keep a per-extension "negative" sentinel so we don't re-probe a
# missing converter on every call.

# trailing ``(m2|m3)`` suffix when ``len > 4``, so IFC-standard names
# like ``NetVolume`` / ``Qto_WallBaseQuantities.NetVolume`` /
# ``Volume cbm`` / ``sqm`` / ``m³`` never resolved to the canonical
