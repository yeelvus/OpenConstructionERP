"""Finding a cost line that sorts past the first page.

Every test here seeds more lines than one page holds, and that is the point
rather than an incidental detail. A search test over a handful of rows passes
whether the search reaches the database or not, because a handful of rows all
fit on the first page and any client-side filter would find them too. The only
assertion that distinguishes a working search from a broken one is that a line
which the unfiltered first page does NOT contain comes back when searched for,
so each test states the control first: not on page one, found by search.

The escaping tests exist because a bill of quantities is full of codes with
underscores in them, and an unescaped ``_`` is a single-character wildcard.
