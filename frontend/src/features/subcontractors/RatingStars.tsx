/**
 * Five-star rendering of a subcontractor's `rating_score`.
 *
 * Score domain: 0..100. That is the domain the rating engine clamps to, the
 * one ScorecardTile draws its dials on, and the one the "low rating" pill on
 * a purchase order compares against.
 *
 * The stars and the number are two renderings of the same value, so they have
 * to agree about the scale or the row contradicts itself. They did not: the
 * number printed bare, and a bare number beside five stars reads as a score
 * out of five. A register carrying 4.20 therefore drew five empty stars next
 * to the digit 4, which a reader had every reason to take as four out of
 * five. The number now carries its denominator, so neither half can be read
 * on the wrong scale.
 *
 * The denominator goes through `fmtFixed` rather than being pasted in as a
 * literal so that both halves of the fraction are written in the reader's
 * numbering system, and it sits inline rather than behind a translation key
 * because it is digits and a solidus, the same notation the supplier
 * catalogue already prints beside its own stars.
