"""Check that the guard count in the repo-hygiene header still matches the file.

The header of `.github/workflows/repo-hygiene.yml` opens by saying how many
guards the file runs. That number was written by hand on 2026-08-24 and nobody
recounted it: it still read twenty-one on 2026-08-29, when the file had grown
past fifty. A count nobody recounts does not merely go stale, it dates the file
falsely - a reader who trusts it believes the gate is a third of its real size
and stops looking. The same header carried a second hand-written count ("two
ten-step jobs") that went wrong in the same week for the same reason, which is
why this exists rather than a third correction.

What counts as a guard: a named step (`- name:`) that is not a tooling install.
That definition is not a preference. It is the rule that reproduces BOTH counts
the header carried at 95a136ed0, the commit that wrote them - twenty-one guards
spread over jobs of ten, ten and one steps, with no install steps in the file at
the time. A rule that cannot reproduce the number it is replacing would be a
second guess wearing the clothes of a measurement.

Install steps are excluded because they set up tooling and cannot refuse
anything: a missing compiler fails the job as an error, not as a verdict about
the tree. Everything else - Check, Prove, Report, Scan, Lint - fails the job on
a finding, so all of it guards.

Exit codes: 0 when the line and the file agree, 1 when they have drifted, 2 when
the guard could not prove it still refuses.
