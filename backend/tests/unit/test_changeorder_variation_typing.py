"""A change order says which instrument it is, not only why it exists.

``reason_category`` has always answered "why": a design changed, a condition
was unforeseen. ``variation_type`` answers a different question, "what document
is this", and the answer decides who signs, what evidence is required and which
clause governs. The two are independent: an unforeseen site condition can be
settled as an instructed change, as a signed site record, or as a claim.

Until now the column existed on the model and nothing could put a value in it.
It was absent from every schema, so the API had no way to set it and no way to
return it, and it held no data anywhere. That is why it can be given a closed
vocabulary without a migration to clean up behind it: there are no rows to
reject.

The vocabulary is neutral English rather than a transliteration, because the
same three instruments exist under the international contract standards and
under Chinese practice, where they are named 工程变更, 现场签证 and 索赔.
