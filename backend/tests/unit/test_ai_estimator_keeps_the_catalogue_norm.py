"""The AI estimator must carry the catalogue's per-unit norm, not substitute 1.0.

The catalogue stores a work item's resource buildup in ``CostItem.components``
and writes each component's per-unit norm as ``quantity``. That is established
by arithmetic rather than by the field's name: ``resource_pricing`` prices an
item as the sum over its components of ``quantity * unit_price`` and stores the
result as the item's UNIT rate, so ``quantity`` is per one unit of the item.

The estimator translates that shape into its own at exactly one boundary,
``_resource_breakdown``. That boundary used to read a key the costs module
never writes, so every component fell through to a default of 1.0, and applying
a position then stored, for every resource, a quantity equal to the position's
own quantity.

The failure was invisible on review. The unit rate is written separately from
the chosen candidate at apply time, so the position's money looked right; only
a later edit that re-derives the rate from the buildup exposed it, by which
point the number could be out by two orders of magnitude.

So the assertions below are deliberately about the RELATIONSHIP between the
norm and the parent quantity, not about a single expected figure. A test that
only checked one arithmetic result would pass again the moment some other
default happened to produce it.
