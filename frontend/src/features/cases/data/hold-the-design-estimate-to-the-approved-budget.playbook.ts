// Case: "Hold the design estimate to the approved budget" (CN).
//
// State-funded work in China runs an approval chain of estimates, each one
// bound by the last: an investment estimate at feasibility, a design estimate
// that may not exceed it, and a construction-drawing budget that may not exceed
// that. Cost-capped design is the practice of handing the design team a rate
// per square metre at the start and holding them to it, rather than pricing
// whatever comes back and negotiating afterwards.
//
// The product's part in that is the measurement, not the enforcement. It gives
// you a conceptual number with a rate per square metre behind it, a written
// basis so the next stage is priced on the same assumptions, and a line-by-line
// comparison between the bill as it stands and the version that was approved.
// It does not declare a ceiling and it does not return a verdict; holding the
// cap is a decision somebody makes, and the case says so rather than implying
// a control that is not there. Content strings are key plus inline English
// default and live only here.

  longDescDefault:
    "The approval chain on public work is a sequence of estimates in which each stage is bound by the one before it, and the failure mode is always the same: the design develops for eight months without anybody pricing it, and the design estimate arrives twenty percent over a figure that was approved on assumptions nobody wrote down. By then the argument is about whether the scope changed, and there is no document that could settle it. This case puts two things in place early. The first is a stated basis, so the next stage is priced against the same assumptions rather than against a remembered version of them. The second is a comparison run at every gate rather than at the end, while a section that has moved is still small enough to be a design decision instead of a re-approval. The comparison tells you where the money went; deciding whether that is acceptable is yours, and it is not a decision worth automating.",
