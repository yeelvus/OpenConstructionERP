/**
 * The subscription address of a project's iCalendar feed.
 *
 * The server serves one feed per project and authenticates on a token in the
 * query string:
 *
 *     GET /api/v1/integrations/calendar/{project_id}.ics/?token=...
 *
 * The integrations page used to print the origin followed by a bare
 * `feed.ics`. That addressed nothing the server has: no project in the path
 * and no token at all, so everyone who copied it into a calendar client got a
 * rejection instead of a feed, with nothing on screen to say why.
 *
 * The token is an API key and no screen issues one yet, so the address is
 * built with the placeholder left standing rather than pretending this page
 * can fill it in. A gap the reader can see and act on beats a complete looking
 * string that cannot work.
