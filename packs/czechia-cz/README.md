# Czech Republic Construction Pack

Configures OpenConstructionERP for the Czech construction market. The Czech
estimating tradition is built on TSKP (Tridnik stavebnich konstrukci a praci),
a work classification system that structures both project budgets (rozpocet)
and price databases. Currency is CZK with 21% DPH on construction services.

## What makes a Czech estimate Czech

A Czech rozpocet (construction budget) is structured by TSKP groups, which
classify building works into a hierarchy of construction and work types.
Price databases from providers like URS or RTS supply unit rates keyed to
TSKP codes, and a rozpocet that cannot be read against those codes cannot
be checked against any published price level.

Public procurement follows Zakon 134/2016 Sb. (the Public Procurement Act)
and the associated decree 169/2016 Sb. that governs pricing of public
construction works. The Stavebni zakon (Building Act) 283/2021 Sb. defines
the building permit and control framework.

DPH (dan z pridane hodnoty, VAT) on construction services is 21 percent at
the standard rate, with a reduced 12 percent rate applying to certain housing
works. The pack sets the `cz_dph_21` tax template.

## What this pack enables

- **Currency CZK** with the `cz_dph_21` tax template and the `czechia`
  estimating methodology
- **DIN 276 rule set** for classification validation, as the nearest supported
  hierarchy Czech TSKP-structured bills map onto
- **Two demo projects**: an office building in Prague and a residential
  development in Brno, both priced at Czech 2026 market rates in CZK
  excluding DPH
- **CSN, TSKP and public procurement regulatory references** in the pack
  metadata
