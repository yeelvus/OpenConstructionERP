// DashboardCasesCard - the "Cases" entry block on the dashboard.
//
// More than a link: it surfaces a gallery of cases the user can jump straight
// into, ranked so that anything half-finished comes first (so you can resume),
// then cases that match the role and company the user picked on the Cases hub,
// then the rest by order. Each tile drops the user directly into that case; the
// header and the browse button go to the full hub.
//
// THE BLOCK IS THE USER'S, NOT OURS. It is registry widget `cases_learn`
// (widgetRegistry.ts), rendered by DashboardPage inside the customizable grid,
// which means it can already be reordered, narrowed and hidden from Customize
// like every other card. That was only reachable from a panel most people
// never open, so the card carries the same two controls itself: WIDTH, which
// is the dashboard's own per-widget span preference, and HIDE, which is the
// dashboard's own hidden set. Neither is a new mechanism and neither is local
// to this card - narrowing here moves the same slider Customize shows, and a
// hidden card comes back from Customize, by the name the registry gives it.
//
// The gallery is sized FROM that width preference rather than beside it. The
// grid's breakpoints are viewport-wide, not container-wide, so a half-width
// card asked for six columns would draw six microscopic tiles on a wide screen:
// the column count, the preview count and the type scale all have to come from
// the same number. They do, in GALLERY_BY_SPAN below.

 * How the gallery is drawn at each width. Full width is the default and is
 * meant to read as a real part of the dashboard: seventeen cases plus the way
 * into the rest, NINE across on a wide screen, which is TWO rows.
 *
 * Nine, not the six it drew before, and the block loses about a quarter of its
 * height for it. Height here is not set by a height: a tile is a 16/9 banner
 * over two lines of text that never wrap (both are `truncate`), so the text
 * block is a constant and only the banner moves with the column width. On a
 * 1400px-wide card - stated because the number depends on it - the tile goes
 * from roughly 227px across to 148px, its banner from 128px to 83px, and the
 * two rows from about 366px to 272px. Six MORE cases in a quarter LESS room,
 * which is the trade the width was hiding all along: at six across the tiles
 * were larger than the line art inside them needed.
 *
 * Two rows is the rule at every width, not a number chosen for the full-width
 * card alone. Each count is two rows at the widest column count in its own
 * `columns` string, minus the one cell the "all cases" tile takes. That is what
 * keeps the ladder monotonic: narrowing the card has to show FEWER cases, and a
 * count fixed only at span 6 would have left a card that grew when you shrank
 * it. Spans 4 and 3 land on the same number because they share a `columns`
 * string; only the portrait size and the type scale differ between them.
 *
 * The narrow breakpoints moved up with the wide ones on purpose. Raising only
 * the widest column count would have kept the same tile count on a phone at
 * two across, so the block a laptop shows a third shorter would have grown by
 * half on the device with the least room for it.
 *
 * Six across starts at `md` rather than `sm` for the same reason nine is the
 * ceiling and not twelve. A tile is only ever as tall as it is wide, so the
 * column count that reads well is the one where the drawing still reads: six
 * across a 640px viewport is a 105px tile, narrower than the portrait band and
 * the title need, while at 768 it is 128px. The ladder is bounded by the
 * smallest tile that still shows a picture, not by how many will fit.
