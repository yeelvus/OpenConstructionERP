# DDC-CWICR-OE: DataDrivenConstruction - OpenConstructionERP
"""Four demo seeds whose rows are derived from data that already exists.

Validation reports, reconciliation links, project documents and DWG markup are
not registers a seeder may author from imagination. Each one is a statement
about something else in the estate: a report is the engine's verdict on a real
BOQ, a link points at two records in other modules, a document row claims bytes
on disk, an annotation claims a measurement off real geometry. A seeder can
therefore be wrong in a way no exit code shows - it can write rows that look
right and say something false.

So each module is pinned four ways against a real database: rows appear for a
demo project, a second pass does not double them, a project without the demo
marker is left alone, and - the one that matters - the derivation is re-computed
here and compared. The validation report is diffed against a fresh engine run
over the same positions; every persisted link is resolved back to its source
row; every document's recorded size is compared with the file it names; every
measurement is recomputed from the annotation's own coordinates.

The demo-marker test is not a formality. ``enrich_all`` hands every seeder every
project in the database, including a customer's own, so a seeder that gates on
"this project has no rows of my type" would write into live projects.
