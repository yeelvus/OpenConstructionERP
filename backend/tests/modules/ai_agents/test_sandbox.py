"""Integration tests for the seeded AI sandbox (PostgreSQL, py3.12).

Seeds the sample agent runs and checks that they are scored (so the accuracy
scoreboard renders populated), idempotent, per-user scoped, and clearly marked
so they can be identified and removed.

The scoring tests run as the hosted demo, because that is the only deployment
where seeding happens at all and the only one where sample runs count toward
accuracy. The opposite case has its own test at the bottom of the file.

    The seeding endpoint is gated on ``OE_DEMO_MODE`` and the scoreboard leaves

    samples on a box that is not the demo" is a state the product cannot reach.
    Asserting the scoreboard against it pins behaviour no user can observe, and
    it also empties the scoreboard for every user at once, which is enough to
    make a scoping assertion pass without scoping working.
