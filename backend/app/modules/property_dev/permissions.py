    # Deleting is guarded by two different arrangements, so it needs two
    # permissions. Measured over router.py: 24 routes were gated by
    # ``property_dev.delete``. On 19 of them the handler also calls a
    # ``_verify_owner_via_*`` helper, and that ownership check is strict -
    # only ``project.owner_id`` passes, the global admin role included. On
    # the remaining 5 the permission is the only wall there is.
    #
    # No single level is correct for both halves. At MANAGER the 19 are
    # unusable by anyone whenever the owning project belongs to an editor:
    # the owner holds no permission and everyone holding the permission
    # fails the owner check, so the row can never be removed. At EDITOR the
    # 5 would lose their only protection.
    #
    # Hence the split below. ``owner_scoped_delete`` is deliberately NOT
    # named as a variant of ``delete``: it is not a weaker delete, it is a
    # delete whose real wall is ownership rather than role. It is only safe
    # while every route carrying it also calls an owner helper, which is an
    # invariant a test enforces - see

    # (EDITOR) could never pass RBAC, and a MANAGER would pass RBAC but fail
    # the ownership check. Same split logic as ``owner_scoped_delete`` above.
