"""PG: the schedule list endpoints report the whole set, not just the page.

Both reads were capped and silent. ``GET /schedules/`` returned at most 50
rows and ``GET /schedules/{id}/activities/`` at most 1000, each as a bare
JSON array, so a client had no way to distinguish a complete list from a
truncated one. The repository was already running a ``count(*)`` to build
the page and the router discarded it.

The assertion that matters is ``total > len(items)``. Asserting only that a
``total`` field exists would pass against ``total=len(items)``, which is the
shape that states a wrong number out loud rather than staying quiet - the
census found three of those elsewhere in the tree, so it is not theoretical.

Real PostgreSQL because the count is a SQL aggregate over the filtered set,
and an in-memory stub would let the page length and the total agree by
construction.

Gated by ``OE_TEST_DB=pg`` (see conftest).
