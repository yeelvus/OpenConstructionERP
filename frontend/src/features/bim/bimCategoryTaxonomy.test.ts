/**
 * #179 - the same IFC category was named two ways on one screen. The Filter
 * & Group panel on the left showed "Structural Foundation"; the Filtered
 * summary card on the right showed "StructuralFoundation", side by side with
 * the same count.
 *
 * There were two faults behind that, and both are pinned here.
 *
 *   1. The right panel printed `element_type` raw - it never called the
 *      helper at all. That is a call-site fault, covered by the source guard
 *      at the bottom of this file.
 *
 *   2. The helper itself disagreed with itself. "StructuralFoundation" only
 *      came out spaced because someone had typed `structuralfoundation` into
 *      the KNOWN_CATEGORIES table; "StructuralBeam", two rows above it in
 *      the same list, had no table entry and so came out unspaced. The
 *      curated table was carrying a job that belongs to a rule.
 *
 * The assertion that matters for (2) is not "StructuralBeam is spaced" on
 * its own - it is that the two arrive at a spaced label BY THE SAME ROUTE,
 * so adding a category to a model cannot reintroduce the split.
 *
 * Run:  npx vitest run src/features/bim/bimCategoryTaxonomy.test.ts
