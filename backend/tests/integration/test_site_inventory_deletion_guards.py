"""Site-inventory deletion guards: the ledger refuses to be cascaded away.

Before these verbs existed the module had no delete route at all, so a stock item
or a storage location entered by mistake stayed on the register for good. Adding
the verb naively would have been worse than leaving it out: ``StockItem.movements``
carries ``cascade="all, delete-orphan"`` and the database foreign key carries
``ON DELETE CASCADE``, so deleting an item takes its whole movement history with
it and reports 204. A location's movement columns are ``SET NULL``, so deleting a
location blanks it off every movement that happened there, equally quietly.

So the verbs ship with the refusal built in:

* An empty location and an item that never moved delete cleanly.
* A location any movement names, or any item defaults to, refuses with 409
  naming the holders by count and kind.
* An item with a movement history refuses with 409 naming the movement count.
