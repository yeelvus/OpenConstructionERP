"""Running a migration must not silence the application's loggers.

``alembic/env.py`` configures logging from ``alembic.ini`` on every migration
run. ``logging.config.fileConfig`` defaults ``disable_existing_loggers`` to
True, and alembic.ini names only ``root``, ``sqlalchemy`` and ``alembic``, so
the default sets ``disabled = True`` on every other logger that already exists.
A disabled logger drops records inside ``Logger.handle`` before any handler is
reached, it stays disabled for the life of the process, and nothing in
``caplog.at_level`` or ``setLevel`` undoes it.

That does not matter for ``alembic upgrade`` at a shell prompt, where the
process exits straight afterwards. It matters a great deal for a test session,
which runs a migration and then keeps going for another thirty thousand tests.
On the 2026-09-22 nightly the Windows job ran the migration round-trip at test
1530 and then failed 83 later tests across 43 unrelated files, every one of them
asserting on captured log output and every one of them reporting that no record
arrived. macOS was spared only because those migration tests died in setup on an
unrelated bug, so alembic never ran there at all - which is worth remembering,
because fixing that bug hands macOS the same failure unless this one is fixed
too.

Two assertions, and the second is the one that gives the first its meaning. The
keyword being present is a spelling check; the keyword being what keeps the
loggers alive is the property. If a future Python makes ``False`` the default,
the second test goes red and says so rather than leaving a guard that passes for
a reason nobody checked.
