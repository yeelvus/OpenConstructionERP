"""Clean shutdown request served for the desktop launcher.

Why this exists. The desktop shell stopped its backend by killing the process
tree, which crash-stops the embedded PostgreSQL cluster on every normal close of
the app, not only on upgrade. The next start then has a write-ahead log to
replay, which on a large cluster takes minutes, and the launcher reported that
healthy-but-slow start to the user as "the application backend did not start in
time". Retrying reproduced it, because nothing had gone wrong to clear.

The clean stop is this process's own shutdown handler (``app.main``, which stops
the collaboration sweeper, disposes the engine and then stops the cluster). On
POSIX the launcher reaches it with SIGTERM. On Windows there is no signal a
windowless parent can deliver to a console child, so the honest answer is a
shutdown the backend serves for itself - this endpoint - and the launcher then
uses the same request on every platform.

An endpoint that stops the server is exactly the one nobody else may reach, so
it is guarded three times over:

* **desktop mode only** - a shared server never answers it at all;
* **loopback only** - the request must come from this machine;
* **shared secret** - the launcher generates a fresh random token for every run
  and hands it to the backend in the environment when it spawns it. The token
  never leaves the machine, and a browser cannot forge the header that carries
  it: a cross-origin request with a custom header is preflighted, and the
  preflight is refused, so a web page cannot close somebody's application by
  posting at their loopback port.

Missing configuration always refuses. A backend started without the token
environment variable cannot be stopped this way at all, which is the correct
answer for every backend the launcher did not start.
