"""Locate and read the licence texts that ship inside the application.

``app/core/licenses`` holds the verbatim texts of the licences our bundled
third-party libraries are under: LGPL-3.0 and LGPL-2.1 for the libraries
NOTICE lists, GPL-3.0 because LGPL-3.0 is written as additional permissions on
top of it and asks for both, and the OpenSSL, SSLeay, HarfBuzz and PostgreSQL
texts for the native binaries that arrive inside other packages' wheels.

They were committed there because that directory was measured to reach every
published artefact: the whole ``app`` tree is staged as data by
``desktop/pyinstaller.spec`` and force-included in the wheel. What was missing
is any way to read them from the running product. Nothing in the backend
imported this directory at all, so the texts travelled with every install and
no user could see one. That matters most in the desktop build with no network,
where a link to gnu.org is a link to nothing, and that is exactly the
deployment where someone is most likely to be looking for them.

Locating the directory
----------------------
Two candidates, tried in order and both validated by content rather than by
name. The first is the directory beside this module, which is right in a
checkout and after ``pip install`` because the data sits inside the package.
The second is ``app/core/licenses`` under ``sys._MEIPASS``, which is where the
frozen desktop build extracts it; that one is listed explicitly rather than
relied upon through ``__file__``, because a module inside a PyInstaller
archive has no file on disk and the value of its ``__file__`` is a detail of
the bundler rather than a promise.

The ``app/`` in that second candidate is not a guess. ``desktop/pyinstaller.spec``
ships ``backend/app`` to the bundle destination ``app``, so everything inside
``backend/app/core`` arrives under ``sys._MEIPASS/app/core``.
``tests/unit/test_license_texts.py`` reads that entry back out of the spec, so
the day somebody changes the destination this stops being true in a test
rather than in a desktop build nobody can read a licence from.

No third candidate walks upwards. Reaching a directory by counting parents is
the arithmetic that ``app/core/match_service/data_paths.py`` exists to replace,
and it has been wrong here three times before in this codebase. What is
borrowed from that module is the shape rather than the code: explicit
candidates instead of a parent count, each accepted on content rather than on
its name, and resolved per call rather than frozen at import. Its own helper
does not fit, because it locates data sitting NEXT TO the ``app`` package and
these texts sit inside it.

Failing loudly
--------------
A missing directory raises :class:`LicenseTextsUnavailable` rather than
returning an empty list. An empty list is indistinguishable from a build that
carries no licences, and a caller that renders it shows a licence panel with
nothing in it, which is worse than an error because it reads as a statement
that there is nothing to show.
