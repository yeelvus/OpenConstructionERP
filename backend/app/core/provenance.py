"""How an answer was arrived at, travelling beside the answer.

Wave one of the jurisdiction plan. The product resolves a great many things from
a jurisdiction - working weeks, payment clocks, notice periods, tax rates, phone
and address rules - and until now the resolved value travelled alone. A caller
handed a number could not tell a row written for its own country from a default
that happens to be shaped like one, and several surfaces went further and
stamped the requested country onto an answer produced by the generic rules.

That is the defect this module exists to make unspellable. It is not
instrumentation and not logging: a log is not something a caller can branch on,
and every one of the defects below was already being logged when it shipped.

What it is not
--------------
It is not a wrapper around the value. Wrapping was considered and rejected,
because provenance is per axis rather than per answer, and a single wrapper
keyed on jurisdiction paints an answer green while a second axis is silently
wrong. The tax engine is the worked example: it raises on an unknown
jurisdiction, which is honest, and returns the same bytes for "zero-rated" and
"I have no rate for this date", which is not. One envelope would have called it
covered. So a :class:`Provenance` is a *field beside* the value, and a function
with two axes returns two of them.

The pattern is not invented here either. :func:`app.modules.carbon.
resolve_grid_factor` has shipped it correctly for some time, returning the
country requested, the country used, and an explicit fallback flag, with a
docstring saying why: so a reviewer is never handed a country-specific-looking
number that is really a world average. This module is that pattern given a name,
so that four modules adopting it at once end up with one vocabulary instead of
four.

Why the constructor refuses some combinations
---------------------------------------------
:class:`Provenance` rejects a declaration that contradicts itself, and that is
the whole point of it being a type. ``source=DECLARED`` with ``requested`` and
``used`` differing is precisely the shipped defect where a config endpoint says
"these are Canada's phone rules" about the generic ones; ``source=FALLBACK``
with the two equal is the same lie told the other way. Both raise. A caller can
still write down something false about the world, but it can no longer write
down something the fields themselves disagree about.

Why a fallback must name what answered
--------------------------------------
``source=FALLBACK`` with an empty ``used`` is refused, and it is worth saying
why separately, because it is the one contradiction a careful adopter produces
without trying. ``fell_back(axis, code, table.get(code, ""))`` looks reasonable
and yields a fallback that names nothing as having stood in, while still
reporting :attr:`~Provenance.usable` as true. A caller is then told it may
compute with a value whose origin the record does not carry, which is the exact
condition this module exists to make unspellable. Name the stand-in, even if
only as a token such as ``"INTERNATIONAL"``; and if nothing answered at all,
that is an :attr:`Source.UNAVAILABLE`, not a fallback.

``used`` is descriptive, never a discriminant
---------------------------------------------
Branch on :attr:`Provenance.source`, or on :attr:`~Provenance.answered` for the
boolean. Never on the text of ``used``. The source is an enum defined once in
this file and cannot drift; the stand-in token is per module by design, because
what answered in one module's absence genuinely differs from what answered in
another's. Code reading ``used == "INTERNATIONAL"`` to catch every fallback is
asking the wrong field, and it will miss the fallbacks whose stand-in is
something else.

Which is also why the token is named for the thing that answered and not for
the slot it fills. ``"DEFAULT"`` tells a reader only that the non-default did
not answer, and :attr:`~Provenance.answered` already told them that. A token
naming a permissive digit pattern, a hardcoded Monday-to-Friday week or a
genuine international default carries what the value cannot: the shape of what
the caller is actually holding. The test for a candidate token is whether a
reader who has never opened the module learns something from it; if it would be
equally true of a different stand-in, it is too weak.

The token must also not claim more than the stand-in is. Calling a permissive
pattern ``"INTERNATIONAL"`` would assert an international standard behind a
regex that exists to accept anything, which is the same overclaim this module
refuses everywhere else.

Why UNAVAILABLE is not FALLBACK
-------------------------------
A fallback is an answer: the generic rule applied, and it may well be right. An
unavailable is the absence of one, and the two must never share a code path,
because the failure that motivated this distinction is a holiday calculation
raising, being swallowed into an empty set, and every day of the year becoming a
working day with nothing but a log to say so. "No holidays" and "I could not
work out the holidays" are different, and only one of them is safe to compute
dates from.
