"""A generated PDF can print Chinese, and printing it changes nothing else.

The bundled DejaVu faces have no Han glyphs at all - not a thin subset, none -
so until now every Chinese string in every generated PDF came out as boxes.
The fix references an Adobe CID face that reportlab already carries metrics
for, which costs no dependency and no bundled megabytes.

Two properties matter and they pull against each other. The face has to be
reachable when the text needs it, and it must not become the face anything
else prints in: ``BODY_FONT`` and ``BOLD_FONT`` are module globals that every
generator binds at import time, so a per-document choice that wrote to them
would change every later German and Russian document in the same worker. The
selection is therefore per call, and the assertions below check both halves.
