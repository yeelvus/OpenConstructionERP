"""Currency / FX service: rate history, provenance, conversion and revaluation.

A construction project is estimated in one currency, procured in a second and
reported in a third, and the three move against each other for the whole of a
multi-year programme. This service is what keeps that honest:

* **A rate valid on a date.** Rates are stored as published sets
  (:class:`~app.modules.fx.models.FxRateSet`), so any figure can be repriced at
  the rates that actually applied when it was agreed, not at today's.
* **Provenance.** Every set records where it came from, what it was read from
  and when it was captured, and can be locked so a pinned estimate reprices
  identically a year later.
* **Movement attribution.** :meth:`FxService.revalue` splits a change in a
  reported figure into the part that came from scope and the part that came
  from the exchange rate, which is the question a cost report is actually asked.

Market rates come from the European Central Bank daily reference feed, which is
EUR based (``rate`` = units of a currency per 1 EUR). Resolution falls back in a
fixed order - the applicable rate set, then the legacy latest-rate cache, then
the bundled ``fx_seed.json`` - so conversion works offline and on an
installation upgraded from a version that only had the cache. The result always
says which of the three it used.

Optional purchasing-power-parity conversion uses World Bank factors (indicator
``PA.NUS.PPP``). It is best-effort: a missing factor is reported as unavailable
rather than raised.

All network access is wrapped with a timeout and cannot propagate out of a
public method.
