"""The Chinese pack, and the one word it spelled two ways.

A Chinese cost item is read by two things that never agreed with each other.
``match_elements`` builds a section path by asking
:func:`classification_order` which standards to try and taking the first one
the item has a code under; the registry answers ``gb50500``. The two engine
rules read the same dict under ``gbt50500``, and the shipped demo bills were
keyed to match the rules. So the rules worked, and every line of both Chinese
demo projects rendered with no section path at all.

Neither half errored. A missing section path is an empty string, and an empty
string is what a line with no classification looks like, so there was nothing
to see. The tests below are mostly about that: they assert the produced value
rather than the absence of an exception, because absence of an exception was
never in question.
