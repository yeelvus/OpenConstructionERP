"""The statutory limitation regimes for defect claims, and the dates they produce.

A German construction contract runs the limitation of its defect claims
(Verjährung der Mängelansprüche) on one of two clocks, and which one applies is
decided by the contract rather than by the building. Where the parties agreed the
VOB/B, the period for building works is four years. Where they did not, the BGB
gives five. That one year is the whole point: a claim
brought in the fifth year of a VOB/B contract is out of time, and a claim
abandoned in the fifth year of a BGB contract was still good. A register that
records a period without recording which regime produced it is asserting a date
it cannot justify.

**Nothing here is required, and nothing here happens on its own.** A warranty
entry carries no regime until somebody chooses one. An entry with no regime is
left exactly as it was: no period is derived, no date is rewritten, no finding is
raised and nothing is claimed about why it ends when it ends. A team working
under a legal system with no such regime never has to pick one and never sees one.

Scope, stated here so nobody reads four years as universal. VOB/B § 13 Abs. 4
Nr. 1 applies only where the contract agreed no period of its own, and it sets
shorter periods for parts of industrial firing installations exposed to flame or
flue gas and for mechanical and electrical/electronic plant whose maintenance the
client did not entrust to the contractor. The BGB period likewise covers a
Bauwerk and the planning or supervision work done for one; other work has its own
shorter period. Every one of those cases is recorded the same way: enter the
agreed period by hand. The record then disagrees with the regime it names, and
:mod:`app.modules.defects_liability.validators` reports the disagreement instead
of overwriting it, because the contract outranks the default and only a person
knows which one this contract is.

The regimes are written down here as plain frozen values rather than seeded into
a table, unlike :mod:`app.modules.payment_clock.data`, because there are two of
them and a deployment has no reason to edit either. The field names
(``statute``, ``statute_reference``, ``jurisdiction``, ``country_code``,
``notes``) are that module's, so the platform says the same thing about a statute
in both places. No ORM, database, FastAPI or Pydantic dependency, exactly like
:mod:`app.modules.defects_liability.register`.
