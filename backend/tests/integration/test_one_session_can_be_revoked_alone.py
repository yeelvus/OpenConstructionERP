# DDC-CWICR-OE: DataDrivenConstruction - OpenConstructionERP
"""Ending one session must not end the others, and every session must be endable.

Before this, an issued token could not be revoked at all. Every token carried a
``jti`` that nothing ever read, so a credential had a name and no record behind
it: there was nowhere to write down that one session should stop being
honoured. Revoking a single session was not merely unimplemented, it was
inexpressible, and the only lever was rotating the signing secret, which ends
every session of every user at once. A ``sid`` claim and a row it points at are
what make the question answerable.

Two tests, because there are two ways to get this wrong and only one of them
looks like a bug.

The first is the obvious one: revocation has to actually refuse the revoked
credential, and has to leave every other credential alone. A check that refuses
too much passes a test that only asserts the refusal, so the other two tokens
in that test are not decoration - they are what separates "revocation works"
from "authentication is broken".

The second is the one that would ship silently. Revocation can only reach a
session that has a row, so an endpoint that hands out a token pair without
recording one produces a session nobody can ever end. Nothing about such a
token looks wrong: it authenticates perfectly, forever. The formula of the
first test cannot see this, because it exercises the login path alone and
would stay green with every other issuing endpoint leaking unrevocable
sessions. So the second test asserts over the population instead: no endpoint
mints a pair outside the one helper that opens a session.

That distinction was not hypothetical here. The first count of the issuing
sites in this service was three, taken from reading rather than measuring, and
it was wrong by two: ``demo_login`` and ``change_password`` also hand back
pairs. Both would have passed the first test and shipped sessions that could
never be signed out.

Every assertion carries a positive control, for the reason spelled out in
``test_password_change_kills_every_entry_point.py``: a revoked session and a
broken build both present as a refusal, so each credential is first shown to
WORK before it is shown to stop working.
