# RFC 34 — OCE_TECH_SPEC_GLOBAL integration plan

**Status:** draft → ready for review
**Date:** 2026-04-25
**Author:** Claude Opus + Artem
**Related:**
- `OCE_TECH_SPEC_GLOBAL.md` (1941 lines, six modules: CDE, BIM Diff, Validation EAC, Classification, QTO, AI Copilot)
- `OCE_EAC_Implementation_Spec_v2_International.md` (1748 lines, six sections: engine, aliases, block editor, Excel import, composition, 4D)
- ADR 002 — No IfcOpenShell, DDC canonical format is single source of truth
- RFC 33 — CDE module deep audit (continues)
- **RFC 35 — EAC v2 platform implementation (deep plan for §3+§4 of this RFC plus a new §10 Wave 6 4D module)**

> **2026-04-25 update.** A second spec — the EAC v2 international implementation spec — has landed. It replaces this RFC's separate Wave 3 (Validation+Classification) and Wave 4 (QTO) narrative with **one unified EAC engine + four output modes** (aggregate / boolean / clash / issue), and adds a new Wave 6 (4D module). All deep schema, ticket breakdown, and TDD/Playwright contracts for those waves now live in **RFC 35**. This RFC remains the umbrella; §7, §8, and §11 below are updated to reflect the new shape.

## 1. Context

`OCE_TECH_SPEC_GLOBAL.md` is a 1941-line specification of six fundamental modules that constitute the technical core of OpenConstructionERP. About 60–70 % of its surface already exists in the codebase in some form; the remaining 30–40 % is either missing entirely or implemented at a much shallower level than the spec demands.

This RFC is the **strategic integration plan** that locks decisions, names the gaps, sequences the work into waves, and defines the per-ticket acceptance criteria. Per-module RFCs (35–40) are intentionally NOT created here — each module gets its own RFC at the start of its wave, with the deep schema and algorithm details. RFC 34 is the umbrella.

### What the user locked in (2026-04-25)

1. **DDC `cad2data` only.** No IfcOpenShell, no `web-ifc`, no `ifctester` runtime parsing — see ADR 002.
2. **Stack: pick what's best for fast iteration.** I'm choosing Celery (already in `the architecture guide` stack, mature, integrates with Redis we already need), pgvector (single PG dep, no separate Qdrant), `bge-m3` for multilingual embeddings (open-source, multilingual, dense+sparse modes — perfect for hybrid search).
3. **TDD + browser-verified.** Every ticket = unit/integration tests written **first**, then implementation, then Playwright E2E with screenshot. No ticket is "done" without a screenshot in `frontend/test-results/`.

### What the gap audit found

Existing modules vs. spec coverage (verified via two parallel codebase audits):

| Spec module | Existing surface | Coverage | Critical gaps |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0. Cross-cutting | `core/storage.py`, `core/events.py`, `core/cde_states.py` | 70 % | **No async job runner.** Multi-tenant RLS not enforced. |
| 1. CDE (ISO 19650) | `cde/`, `opencde_api/`, `features/cde/` | 75 % | DAG version edges, multipart upload, naming validator, 50-format extractor registry, partitioned audit log. |
| 2. BIM Diff | `bim_hub/BIMModelDiff` (table only) | **25 %** | **No engine.** No BCF/SARIF export. No diff UI. No requirements-impact analysis. |
| 3. Validation EAC | `validation/`, `compliance_ai/`, `features/validation/` | 60 % | EAC tuple formalization, IDS XML round-trip, computed constraints with safe-eval, SARIF export. |
| 4. Classification | embedded in `validation/`, `boq/`, `catalog/` | **40 %** | No formal `classification/` module. No multi-system registry. No ML auto-classify. |
| 5. QTO + BoQ formats | `boq/`, `takeoff/`, `dwg_takeoff/`, three frontend features | 70 % | Nine locale adapters (GAEB DA XML 3.3, AIA G702/G703, RICS NRM2, …), progress billing, variation tracking from BIM diff. |
| 6. AI Copilot | `ai/`, `cost_match/`, `erp_chat/`, `features/erp-chat/` | 65 % | Hybrid search (sparse+dense+RRF+rerank), citation post-validation, semantic chunking, on-prem LLM provider abstraction. |
| **EAC v2 Platform** (added 2026-04-25, deep audit in RFC 35 §2) | `core/validation/engine.py` + `validation/` + `compliance_ai/` skeleton + `bim_requirements/parsers/ids_parser.py` + `schedule/` (skeleton) | **~25 %** | EAC engine + JSON Schema + 4 output modes greenfield; aliases greenfield; block editor greenfield; Excel-DSL import greenfield; classifier composition greenfield; 4D simulation + PWA greenfield. |

## 2. Locked decisions (cannot be reopened during implementation)

| # | Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| L1 | **DDC `cad2data`** is the single CAD/BIM parser. All six modules read its canonical Parquet/JSON. | ADR 002. User-confirmed 2026-04-25. |
| L2 | **Celery + Redis** is the async job runner. `JobRun` table records all background work. | Already in `the architecture guide` stack table. Mature. Integrates with existing Redis. |
| L3 | **pgvector** is the vector store. No Qdrant in core; Qdrant remains as an optional enterprise plugin. | User emphasis on pgvector. One DB to operate. PostgreSQL 16 already required. |
| L4 | **`bge-m3`** is the embedding model (1024-dim dense + sparse). Loaded via `sentence-transformers` or via `infinity` server (CPU-tolerant). | Multilingual (50+ langs), open-source, dense + sparse out of the box, retrieval-tuned, runs on CPU for on-prem. |
| L5 | **Tests first, every ticket.** Unit (pytest) + integration (httpx + real PG/Redis) + E2E (Playwright) + visual screenshot. No screenshot, no merge. | User mandate 2026-04-25. |
| L6 | **i18n from day one** for every new user-facing string. 21 locales already supported by the stack. | `the architecture guide` §i18n + spec §0.6. |
| L7 | **One PR = one logical change.** Wave names map to GitHub project columns; tickets map to PRs. | `the architecture guide` + spec §"Final principles". |
| L8 | **Schema migrations are reversible.** Each ticket = one Alembic migration with `downgrade()` that survives `alembic downgrade base && alembic upgrade head` round-trip. | Spec §0.3, project convention. |
| L9 | **Multi-tenancy via RLS.** PostgreSQL Row-Level Security policies are enabled for every new table that has `tenant_id`. | Spec §0.7 #2. Currently `tenant_id` columns exist but RLS is off. |
| L10 | **Observability built-in.** Every new endpoint emits an OpenTelemetry span; every Celery task emits a `JobRun` row with structured outcome. | Spec §"Final principles" #8. |
| L11 | **One EAC engine, four output modes.** No parallel engines for QTO, validation, clash, or issue. | EAC v2 spec §0.1; RFC 35 L11. |
| L12 | **Rule definition is JSONB (`EacRuleDefinition` v2.0)** with a stable JSON Schema; code parses, never branches on shape. | RFC 35 L12. |
| L13 | **DuckDB over canonical Parquet** is the rule-execution kernel — selectors and predicates compile to one query per rule. | RFC 35 L13; reuses existing `dashboards/duckdb_pool.py`. |
| L14 | **`simpleeval` with whitelisted functions** is the formula evaluator — no `eval()`, no Python compile. | RFC 35 L14. |
| L15 | **`/api/v2/eac/*` is the canonical surface;** `/api/v1/validation/*` and `/api/v1/boq/qto/*` proxy to v2 for ≥6 months before sunset. | RFC 35 L15; spec §0.2. |

## 3. Stack additions (new dependencies)

| Package | Purpose | Justification |
|---|---|---|
| `celery[redis]` | Async job runner | L2. |
| `dramatiq` candidate is rejected — Celery has more battle-tested integrations with our other PaaS code. |
| `bge-m3` model + `sentence-transformers` (or `infinity` server) | Multilingual dense+sparse embeddings | L4. |
| `simpleeval` | Safe expression evaluation for computed validation constraints | Spec §3.6 — never `eval()`. |
| `pyclamd` (optional, gated by env) | Antivirus scan on uploads | Spec §1.2 #10. |
| `python-magic` | Magic-byte validation for upload MIME guarding | Spec §1.10 #5. |
| `lxml` (probably already present) | IDS XML round-trip, GAEB DA XML, BCF XML | Spec §3.8, §5.8. |
| `openpyxl` (already present) | GAEB / Excel BoQ export | Spec §5.8. |
| `pint` (already present) | Unit normalization in QTO + validation | Spec §0.6, §3.10 #7, §5.4. |
| `pdfplumber` or extension of existing `pymupdf` | Document-ingestion text extraction | Spec §6.4. |

**Removed / not adopted** (despite spec recommendation):
- `ifcopenshell`, `ifctester`, `web-ifc` — banned by ADR 002.
- `qdrant-client` — replaced by pgvector per L3.
- `dramatiq`, `arq` — replaced by Celery per L2.

## 4. Cross-cutting infrastructure (Wave 0, 3 weeks)

This is **the prerequisite** for everything in Waves 1–5. Nothing else can proceed until Wave 0 is green.

### W0.1 — Celery + Redis async job runner

- **Files**: `backend/app/core/jobs.py` (Celery app factory), `backend/app/core/job_run.py` (`JobRun` SQLAlchemy model), `backend/app/modules/jobs/router.py` (status endpoints), `docker-compose.yml` (add `worker` service).
- **Schema**: `oe_job_run` (id UUIDv7, tenant_id, kind, status, progress_percent, result_jsonb, error_jsonb, started_at, completed_at, retry_count, idempotency_key UNIQUE).
- **Tests written first**:
  - `tests/unit/test_jobs_idempotency.py` — same idempotency_key returns existing JobRun, never duplicates.
  - `tests/unit/test_jobs_progress.py` — `progress_callback(percent, message)` mutates `JobRun` in atomic update.
  - `tests/integration/test_jobs_celery_redis.py` — real Redis, real Celery worker (testcontainers), full happy-path + DLQ.
  - `tests/e2e/jobs-status.spec.ts` (Playwright) — submit job via API, poll status, screenshot the loading→complete UI.
- **Acceptance**: `make dev` brings up `worker` container; submitting a no-op task returns a `job_run_id`; polling shows progress 0→100; screenshot saved at `frontend/test-results/jobs-happy.png`.

### W0.2 — DDC adapter extension for spec parity

- **Files**: `backend/app/modules/bim_hub/ddc_extras.py` — new helpers that DDC's existing output already supports but isn't exposed: `geometry_signature(element) -> SignatureV1` (mesh_sha256, vertex_count, volume, surface_area, centroid, bbox), `property_set_diff(left, right) -> list[PropertyChange]`, `material_signature(element) -> str`.
- **Tests**: golden samples — one DWG, one RVT-converted IFC, one DGN canonical Parquet — assert per-element signatures are stable across re-conversions (idempotency) and tolerant to 0.1 mm rounding (no false-positive geometry diffs).
- **Acceptance**: `pytest backend/tests/unit/test_ddc_extras.py -v` passes; signature is stable between two conversions of the same source file (modulo `created_at`).

### W0.3 — pgvector standardization

- **Files**: Alembic migration to ensure `CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector`. New `backend/app/core/vector.py` with a thin `VectorStore` Protocol that has two implementations: `PgVectorStore` (default), `QdrantVectorStore` (optional, gated). All existing call sites that import `qdrant_client` directly are routed through `VectorStore`.
- **Tests**: `tests/unit/test_vector_store.py` verifies the same suite passes for both backends (parametrized fixture); `tests/integration/test_pgvector_search.py` runs against real PG with the extension.
- **Acceptance**: `python -c "from app.core.vector import get_vector_store; print(get_vector_store().__class__.__name__)"` prints `PgVectorStore` by default; switching `OE_VECTOR_BACKEND=qdrant` and rerunning prints `QdrantVectorStore`.

### W0.4 — Multi-tenant RLS hardening

- **Files**: Alembic migration to enable RLS + create policies on all tables with `tenant_id`. App-level: `core/db.py` sets `app.current_tenant_id` on every connection from the request middleware (`set_config('app.current_tenant_id', :tenant, true)`).
- **Tests**: `tests/integration/test_rls_isolation.py` — open two sessions for different tenants, verify each can only see its own rows; raw SQL bypass (no `set_config`) fails by default.
- **Acceptance**: integration suite proves cross-tenant data leakage is impossible at the DB level. Adversarial test: a request with `tenant_id=A` that constructs a query for a `bim_element.id` known to belong to `tenant=B` returns 404, not the row.

### W0.5 — Storage abstraction completion

- **Files**: `core/storage.py` already exists; extend with `multipart_upload()` per spec §1.7 + `presigned_url(method='PUT')` for direct browser-to-S3 uploads of files >100 MB.
- **Tests**: golden 200 MB synthetic file uploaded in 5 MB chunks (concurrency 4), SHA-256 verified end-to-end. Local backend uses tempdir + `os.rename` to simulate atomic finalize.
- **Acceptance**: 1 GB upload finishes in <60 s on dev box; presigned URL works against MinIO.

### W0.6 — i18n message catalog wiring (validation messages, AI prompts)

- **Files**: extend existing `backend/app/modules/{module}/messages/{en,de,ru,es,fr}.json` to cover the new modules. New strings during implementation MUST land in catalogs in all five locales (the rest auto-resolve through fallback chains).
- **Acceptance**: CI gate — adding a `t("key")` call without a corresponding entry in `en.json` fails the linter.

**Wave 0 deliverable:** all five sub-tickets green, `make test-backend` passes, `make e2e` passes (jobs-happy, rls-isolation, vector-search, multipart-upload screenshots in `frontend/test-results/`).

## 5. Wave 1 — CDE complete (4 weeks)

Spec Module 1 is 75 % done. Wave 1 closes the gaps to ISO 19650-2 conformance.

### W1.1 — DAG version graph

- **Schema**: new `cde_version_edge(parent_version_id, child_version_id, edge_type)` table where `edge_type ∈ {'revision','branch','merge'}`. Cycle detection via recursive CTE.
- **Tests first**:
  - `tests/unit/test_version_dag.py` — adding edge that creates cycle raises `CycleDetected`; `ancestors_of(v)` returns correct set on a hand-built fixture (linear, branched, merged shapes).
  - `tests/integration/test_version_branch_merge.py` — full branch → diverge → merge round-trip.
- **Acceptance**: REST `GET /v1/cde/files/{id}/versions/graph` returns DAG; UI renders timeline with branches.
- **Visual**: `frontend/test-results/cde-version-dag.png`.

### W1.2 — Multipart upload pipeline (frontend + backend)

- **Spec ref**: §1.7.
- **Files**: `cde/router.py` `+` `upload-init`, `upload-part` (presigned URL hand-off), `upload-complete` (SHA-256 verification, `cde_file_version` row creation, side-jobs trigger).
- **Frontend**: `features/cde/UploadDialog.tsx` — chunked upload, progress bar per chunk + overall.
- **Tests first**:
  - `tests/integration/test_multipart_upload.py` — 200 MB synthetic file uploaded in chunks, integrity verified.
  - `tests/e2e/cde-upload-large.spec.ts` (Playwright) — drag-drop a 50 MB fixture, watch progress bar, screenshot at 0 %, 50 %, 100 %.
- **Acceptance**: 1 GB uploads work end-to-end; resumable across browser refresh (multipart session TTL 24 h).

### W1.3 — Naming validator (ISO 19650-2 §10.2.4)

- **Files**: `cde/naming_validator.py` — DSL for project/org templates (regex-based + field whitelists). Default ISO 19650-2 PAS-1192 template `{Project}-{Originator}-{Volume}-{Level}-{Type}-{Discipline}-{Number}`.
- **Tests first**: parameterised over 30 fixture filenames (valid + invalid in each field); auto-suggest works on near-miss filenames.
- **Acceptance**: bulk import of a folder with mixed naming → report of N valid, M invalid, K auto-corrected suggestions.
- **Visual**: `cde-naming-validator.png` (validation panel with traffic-light per file).

### W1.4 — Format extractor registry (50 formats)

- **Files**: `cde/extractors/registry.py` (Protocol-based registry); per-format adapters under `cde/extractors/{pdf,dwg,docx,xlsx,e57,ifc_canonical,…}.py`. Each adapter declares `supported_mime_types` and returns a JSON-serialisable metadata dict.
- **IFC adapter goes through DDC**, not IfcOpenShell — see ADR 002.
- **Tests first**: golden sample per format; metadata extraction is byte-stable.
- **Acceptance**: uploading a DWG, IFC, RVT, PDF, DOCX, XLSX, E57 each yields a populated `metadata_jsonb` field on the `cde_file_version` row.
- **Visual**: `cde-extractor-results.png`.

### W1.5 — Suitability codes lookup + state-transition audit log

- **Closes** RFC 33 R2 items #1 and #4.
- **Schema**: `cde_state_transition` table; suitability code lookup table populated per ISO 19650 Annex A.
- **Tests first**: every state transition emits exactly one `cde_state_transition` row + one event_bus event; UI dropdown for suitability shows codes filtered by current state.
- **Visual**: `cde-state-transition-history.png`.

### W1.6 — Lock & checkout

- **Schema**: `cde_file.locked_by`, `locked_at`, `lock_expires_at`. Optimistic locking via `version` column.
- **Tests first**: two-session concurrency — first lock wins, second gets HTTP 409. Lock auto-expires at TTL.
- **Acceptance**: editing an XLSX in the UI claims a lock; another user sees a lock indicator.

**Wave 1 deliverable:** CDE passes the spec's acceptance criterion: a file is uploaded, a version is created automatically in the correct state, it can be moved to SHARED and then PUBLISHED, the audit log records every step, and preview works for both PDF and IFC.

## 6. Wave 2 — BIM Diff Engine (5 weeks)

Largest gap (25 % → 100 %). Pure greenfield engine on top of canonical format.

### W2.1 — Diff engine on canonical Parquet

- **Files**: `backend/app/modules/bim_hub/diff/engine.py`, `bim_hub/diff/categorize.py`, `bim_hub/diff/signatures.py` (uses W0.2 helpers).
- **Algorithm** (DDC-canonical version of spec §2.3):
  1. Load both versions' canonical Parquet via DuckDB.
  2. Build `stable_id` index (DDC's persistent element identity, replaces `GlobalId`).
  3. Set difference: `removed`, `added`, `common`.
  4. For each `common` element, compute property diff (JSONB delta), geometry signature compare (mesh_sha256, then bbox/centroid distance with 1 mm tolerance), classification compare, material compare, containment compare.
  5. Emit categorized `BIMModelDiffChange` rows.
- **Performance budget**: 1 M elements diffed in ≤ 5 min on 16-core. Parallelize per-element compare via Celery group of 100 batches.
- **Tests first**:
  - `tests/unit/test_diff_categorize.py` — 14 hand-crafted scenarios (one per change category) on synthetic canonical entities.
  - `tests/integration/test_diff_perf_50k.py` — 50 K elements complete in ≤ 30 s.
  - `tests/integration/test_diff_perf_1m.py` — runs nightly only; budget is 5 min.

### W2.2 — BCF 2.1 / 3.0 exporter

- **Files**: `bim_hub/diff/exporters/bcf.py`. Use `bcf-py` or hand-rolled XML — no IfcOpenShell dependency.
- **Output**: ZIP with `bcf.version`, per-topic folders with `markup.bcf`, `viewpoint.bcfv`, `snapshot.png`.
- **Snapshot**: rendered headless via the existing Three.js viewer (Puppeteer/Playwright). One topic = one screenshot of the changed element.
- **Tests first**: round-trip — generated BCF parses back into a known set of topics; opens cleanly in any BCF-compatible tool (manual smoke once, automated XSD validation always).
- **Visual**: `bim-diff-bcf-export.png` (UI flow + downloaded file size badge).

### W2.3 — SARIF + Excel + PDF + JSON exporters

- **Files**: `bim_hub/diff/exporters/{sarif,xlsx,pdf,json}.py`. SARIF is mandatory for CI/CD integration (spec §2.7).
- **Tests first**: each exporter has a golden output (snapshot test). SARIF validates against `sarif-2.1.0.json` schema.

### W2.4 — Requirements-impact analysis

- **Spec ref**: §2.3 step 5.
- **Files**: `bim_hub/diff/requirements_impact.py`. Hooks into `validation/` module — runs validation on `target_version` filtered to changed elements only, compares against pre-diff results.
- **Tests first**: synthetic diff where one wall's fire-rating drops below threshold → impact row with `impact_type='regression'`; opposite case → `improvement`.

### W2.5 — Side-by-side diff viewer (frontend)

- **Files**: `frontend/src/features/bim/DiffViewerPage.tsx`, `frontend/src/shared/ui/BIMViewer/SyncedCameras.tsx`.
- Two `<BIMViewer>` instances, camera sync via shared Zustand store. Colored overlay per spec §2.8 palette.
- Side panel: filterable change list, click → both viewers fly to element + highlight.
- **Tests first**:
  - `tests/e2e/bim-diff-side-by-side.spec.ts` — load fixture diff, screenshot at default zoom, after applying "PropertyModified" filter, after clicking a change row.
- **Visual**: `bim-diff-overview.png`, `bim-diff-property-filter.png`, `bim-diff-element-focus.png`.

### W2.6 — Variation propagation to QTO

- Subscribes to `ModelDiffCompleted` event, marks affected `boq_item` rows as `requires_review` (Wave 4 consumes; we wire the event now to avoid future migration churn).

**Wave 2 deliverable:** spec acceptance: two IFC versions are uploaded, the diff completes within five minutes, the report is typed, and the BCF opens in a third-party tool. For us s/IFC/canonical/g.

## 7. Wave 3 — Validation EAC + Classification (5 weeks) — **superseded by RFC 35 (Wave EAC-1, EAC-2, EAC-3, EAC-5, EAC-7)**

> The sub-tickets W3.1–W3.6 below are kept for historical traceability. Their actual deep plan now lives in RFC 35 §5 (engine), §6 (aliases), §7 (block editor + IDS), §9 (composition) and §11 (migration). The RFC 35 layout is the source of truth; do not start any of the W3.* tickets directly — open the corresponding EAC-* ticket from RFC 35 instead.

### W3.1 — EAC schema migration

- **Spec ref**: §3.4.
- **Schema**: rename existing `validation_rule` columns to fit the EAC tuple (`entity_class`, `attribute_path`, `constraint_operator`, `constraint_value_jsonb`), add `facets_jsonb` for compound applicability, add `name_locale_jsonb` for i18n.
- **Tests first**: existing rule fixtures (DIN 276, GAEB, NRM, MasterFormat) migrate without behaviour change. Property test (Hypothesis): every constraint operator is covered by at least one rule and at least one passing/failing scenario.

### W3.2 — IDS XML round-trip

- **Files**: `validation/ids/{importer,exporter}.py`. Schema-driven: parse `IDS-1.0.xsd` once, generate dataclasses, map to/from EAC rules. **No `ifctester` runtime parsing of IFC** — only the IDS spec format itself.
- **Tests first**: import 5 published IDS files (buildingSMART samples), export back, byte-compare canonicalised output. Lossless property check.
- **Acceptance**: an IDS file imports, validation runs against it, the result is correct, it exports to SARIF, and the SARIF loads into standard CI/CD platforms.

### W3.3 — Computed constraints + safe expression evaluator

- **Files**: `validation/computed.py` using `simpleeval` with a strict whitelist (`length`, `max`, `min`, `abs`, `re.search`).
- **Tests first**: 30 expressions covering all operators, expected values, error paths (cyclic refs, syntax errors, undefined vars).

### W3.4 — Classification module (new)

- **Files**: new `backend/app/modules/classification/` (manifest, models, schemas, router, service, repository). New tables `classification_system`, `classification_code`, `cost_classification_bridge`, `element_classification`, `classification_rule`.
- **Pre-loaded data**: Uniformat II 2015, OmniClass headers, MasterFormat headers (Alembic data migrations).
- **Tests first**: import each classifier, assert tree integrity (parent codes resolve, depth correct), bilingual lookups work.

### W3.5 — Rule-based + ML auto-classify

- **Files**: `classification/auto_classify.py`. Rule-based first (uses Module 3 engine — DRY). ML pass via pgvector: each classification code has a 1024-dim `bge-m3` embedding; element representation is `entity_class + name + materials + properties` embedding; top-K nearest by cosine.
- **Confidence policy** per spec §4.7: ≥ 0.85 auto-apply, 0.65–0.85 suggest, < 0.65 skip.
- **Tests first**: golden samples — 50 elements with known correct codes. Recall@1 ≥ 0.80, recall@3 ≥ 0.95 for the auto-applied subset.

### W3.6 — Validation + Classification UI

- **Files**: extend `features/validation/ValidationPage.tsx` (rule editor with EAC fields), new `features/classification/AutoClassifyPage.tsx` (interactive grid with accept/reject/edit per element).
- **Tests first**:
  - `tests/e2e/validation-rule-editor.spec.ts` — author a rule via UI, save, verify row in DB, screenshot.
  - `tests/e2e/auto-classify.spec.ts` — run job on fixture, accept high-confidence, manually fix one, screenshot at each stage.
- **Visual**: `validation-rule-editor.png`, `classification-grid.png`.

**Wave 3 deliverable:** spec acceptance for Modules 3 and 4.

## 8. Wave 4 — QTO + BoQ formats (4 weeks) — **partially superseded by RFC 35 (Wave EAC-1 aggregate mode + EAC-5 composition)**

> The QTO engine itself becomes the `aggregate` output mode of the unified EAC engine (RFC 35 §5). What stays in Wave 4 below is **only the locale-export layer** (W4.2 — GAEB DA XML 3.3, AIA G703, RICS NRM2, etc.) and **progress billing** (W4.3, W4.5). Variation tracking (W4.4) is wired to `ModelDiffCompleted` from Wave 2 and consumes EAC `aggregate` runs. W4.1 (`QuantityExtractionRule` schema) is replaced by `EacRule` with `output_mode='aggregate'`.

### W4.1 — QuantityExtractionRule schema + engine

- **Spec ref**: §5.6, §5.7.
- **Schema**: `quantity_extraction_rule`, `boq_item_quantity_source` (already partially exists in `boq/`).
- **Engine** (DDC-canonical): per rule, query DuckDB on canonical Parquet for matching elements, sum the requested quantity (from `BIMElement.quantities` JSONB or computed from geometry signature), apply unit conversion via `pint`.
- **Tests first**: per quantity_type (length/area/volume/count/weight) — golden fixture, expected sum. Edge: mixed units (m + ft) normalise correctly.

### W4.2 — Locale adapters (9)

- **Files**: `boq/exporters/{gaeb_d83,gaeb_d81,aia_g703,rics_nrm2,kc_2,kc_3,stabu,dqe,fidic}.py`. Each adapter has matching `importers/{format}.py`. Round-trip mandatory.
- **Tests first**: per format — golden BoQ → export → import → byte-compare normalised output.

### W4.3 — Progress billing schema + workflow

- **Schema**: `boq_progress_period`, `boq_progress_entry`. Linked to `inspections` and `field_reports` for photo evidence.
- **Tests first**: full period lifecycle — create → fill entries → approve → export PDF + signed-XML → e-signature attached.

### W4.4 — Variation tracking from BIM diff

- Already wired in W2.6; Wave 4 implements consumer: receives `ModelDiffCompleted`, computes per-item delta, emits `BoQVariation` row when |delta| > project threshold (default 5 %).
- **Tests first**: integration — diff that adds 3 walls → variation rows for the 3 affected BoQ items.
- **Visual**: `boq-variation-from-diff.png`.

### W4.5 — Frontend — progress billing UI

- **Files**: `frontend/src/features/boq/ProgressBillingPage.tsx`.
- **Tests first**: E2E — open period, edit entries, approve → PDF download.

**Wave 4 deliverable:** BoQ exports validate against three industry XSDs (GAEB DA XML 3.3, AIA, RICS); progress billing produces signed PDFs.

## 9. Wave 5 — AI Copilot RAG (5 weeks)

### W5.1 — Document ingestion pipeline

- **Files**: `backend/app/modules/ai/ingestion/{pipeline,extractors,chunker}.py`. Subscribes to `FileUploaded` event from CDE. Per-format extractors via the W1.4 registry.
- **Chunking**: semantic, header-aware, 500 tokens with 50-token overlap. Each chunk stamped with `tenant_id`, `project_id`, `file_version_id`, `iso_state`, `language`.
- **Tests first**: golden PDFs in en/de/ru/es/zh — chunk count stable, language detection correct, header context preserved.

### W5.2 — Multilingual embeddings (`bge-m3`)

- **Files**: `ai/embeddings/{bge_m3,sparse}.py`. Dense via `sentence-transformers` (CPU-tolerant). Sparse via the same model's sparse mode.
- **Tests first**: encode 100 sentences across 10 languages, verify cosine similarity matches expected pairs (translations of the same sentence are top-1 nearest).

### W5.3 — Hybrid search with RRF

- **Files**: `ai/search/hybrid.py`. Dense via pgvector cosine, sparse via PostgreSQL `tsvector` GIN index, fused via Reciprocal Rank Fusion (`k=60`).
- **Tests first**: 50 golden Q&A pairs; recall@5 must improve over dense-only baseline by ≥ 10 %.

### W5.4 — Cross-encoder reranker

- **Files**: `ai/search/rerank.py`. Use `bge-reranker-v2-m3` (also multilingual, also open).
- **Tests first**: nDCG@10 improves over RRF-only by ≥ 5 % on the golden set.

### W5.5 — RAG conversation with citation post-validation

- **Files**: `ai/rag/conversation.py`, `ai/rag/citations.py`. System prompt requires inline `[ref:chunk_id]`. Post-generation: regex parses citations, validates each `chunk_id` exists in the retrieved context. Hallucinated citations stripped + warning logged.
- **Tests first**: adversarial test — model fabricates a chunk_id → post-validation strips it; happy path — every citation resolves to a real chunk.

### W5.6 — LLM provider abstraction

- **Files**: `ai/llm/{anthropic,openai,ollama,vllm}.py` + `ai/llm/router.py`. Switch via `OE_LLM_PROVIDER` env. Default `anthropic` for cloud, `ollama` for on-prem.
- **Tests first**: contract test runs against a stub HTTP server that mimics each provider's streaming SSE protocol.

### W5.7 — Auto-tasks

- **Issue auto-classification** — few-shot prompt, calibrated confidence.
- **Diff narrative** — subscribes to `ModelDiffCompleted`, generates human-readable summary.
- **Requirements extraction from EIR PDF** — proposes `ValidationRule` rows with `requires_review=true`, never auto-applies.
- **Tests first**: per task — golden input, expected output, regression-tested at every release (eval framework, spec §6.12).

### W5.8 — Frontend — copilot UI enhancement

- **Files**: extend existing `features/erp-chat/full-page/ChatFullPage.tsx`. Add citation pills (click → opens source document at the cited page).
- **Visual**: `copilot-citation-click.png`.

**Wave 5 deliverable:** spec acceptance: an EIR PDF is uploaded, a question is asked in any supported language, the answer cites three or more sources, and clicking a citation opens the page it came from.

## 9b. Wave 6 — 4D module (5 weeks; new — added by EAC v2 spec §6, deep plan in RFC 35 §10)

> Source-of-truth for sub-tickets: RFC 35 §10. Summary here for the dependency-graph view only.

- **EAC-6.1** PMXML / MSPDI / CSV import.
- **EAC-6.2** `EacScheduleLink` schema — task ↔ EAC predicate.
- **EAC-6.3** AI auto-link (uses RFC 34 W5.6 LLM provider abstraction).
- **EAC-6.4** Simulation engine + 3D viewer integration + MP4/GIF export.
- **EAC-6.5** S-curve / SPI / CPI dashboard + EAC/ETC forecasting.
- **EAC-6.6** Mobile PWA — foreman view, offline queue, geolocation, photo evidence.

**Wave 6 deliverable:** spec §6 AC-6.1..AC-6.8 green; mobile PWA installs to home screen on iOS and Android; simulation runs at ≥30 fps on 100 k-element model.

## 10. Verification gates (every ticket)

Each ticket above is closed only when **all** of these are green:

1. **Unit tests** in `backend/tests/unit/` — written first, then code.
2. **Integration tests** in `backend/tests/integration/` — real PG (testcontainers), real Redis, real Celery worker. No mocks for infra.
3. **E2E test** in `frontend/e2e/` (Playwright) — full user flow.
4. **Visual screenshot** committed to `frontend/test-results/{ticket-slug}/{state}.png`. PR description includes thumbnails.
5. **OpenAPI** updated; auto-generated TypeScript client compiles with no manual edits.
6. **i18n** strings present in `en.json` + at least `de.json`, `ru.json`.
7. **Migration** is reversible: `alembic downgrade -1 && alembic upgrade head` round-trips with no data loss.
8. **Observability**: every endpoint emits OTel span; every Celery task records a `JobRun` row.
9. **CI gate**: `ruff check`, `mypy --strict` for new code, `pytest --cov=backend/app/modules/{module} --cov-fail-under=85`.
10. **Manual check**: open the feature in a browser locally, click through the golden path + at least two edge cases, capture screenshot. Compare with the Playwright snapshot.

## 11. Per-wave dependency graph

```
Wave 0 (foundation, RFC 34 §4)
   │
   ├─→ Wave 1 (CDE, RFC 34 §5)
   │     │
   │     ├─→ Wave 2 (BIM Diff, RFC 34 §6)
   │     │     │
   │     │     └─→ Wave 4 variation tracking (W4.4)
   │     │
   │     └─→ Wave 5.1 (ingestion subscribes to FileUploaded)
   │
   ├─→ Wave EAC (RFC 35 — supersedes Waves 3+4 engine layer)
   │     │
   │     ├─→ EAC-1 Engine ──┬─→ EAC-2 Aliases  (parallel)
   │     │                  ├─→ EAC-3 Block editor + IDS  (parallel)
   │     │                  ├─→ EAC-4 Excel import  (parallel)
   │     │                  ├─→ EAC-5 Composition  (after EAC-1+EAC-2)
   │     │                  └─→ EAC-6 4D module = Wave 6 (after EAC-1)
   │     │
   │     └─→ EAC-7 Migration v1→v2 (threaded)
   │
   ├─→ Wave 4 locale exporters (W4.2) + progress billing (W4.3, W4.5)
   │     └─→ depends on EAC-1 aggregate runs
   │
   └─→ Wave 5 (AI Copilot, RFC 34 §9) — uses W0.3 pgvector, W0.1 jobs
```

Wave 1 and Wave EAC can run in parallel after Wave 0 (different code paths). Wave 2 depends on Wave 1 (needs the version DAG). Wave 4 locale exporters depend on Wave EAC-1 (aggregate output). Wave 5 depends on Wave 0 only.

**Total calendar time** at a single-track pace: ~30 weeks (was 26; +5 for Wave 6 4D, –1 for collapsed engine layer in Wave EAC). Parallel-track (W1+EAC+W5 simultaneously after W0): ~18 weeks.

## 12. Risks + mitigation

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| DDC `cad2data` doesn't expose mesh-hash → Wave 2 blocked | Medium | High | W0.2 spike (1 day) verifies on real samples; if missing, escalate to DDC team for a small extension before Wave 2 starts. |
| `bge-m3` is too slow on CPU for on-prem deployments | Medium | Medium | Fallback: `multilingual-e5-large` (smaller). Worker pool can warm-cache embeddings. |
| GAEB DA XML 3.3 round-trip mismatch on edge cases | High | Medium | Use the official GAEB validator XSD as a fuzz seed; 100+ real-world fixtures from DACH partners. |
| Multi-tenant RLS regression breaks existing tenants | High | High | W0.4 staged: enable RLS in `audit-only` mode first; promote to `enforce` after one week of clean audit. |
| Playwright screenshot flakiness blocks merges | Medium | Medium | Visual snapshots only on stable widgets (no animations); `expect(page).toHaveScreenshot({maxDiffPixels: 100})` tolerance. |
| Spec drift — buildingSMART updates IDS spec mid-implementation | Low | Medium | Version-pin the IDS schema we target (`IDS-1.0`). Dedicated migration when next version lands. |

## 13. Out of scope (explicit)

- **Native Rust/C++ acceleration of any module.** Spec §"Final principles" #1: "No premature optimization."
- **Air-gapped deployment automation.** On-prem mode (Wave 5) is supported via configuration; air-gapped install scripts are a separate RFC.
- **Mobile-first redesign.** Existing UIs are desktop-optimised; mobile will follow the existing PWA approach.
- **Multi-region GAEB extensions** (Austrian ÖNORM, Swiss SIA). Add as Wave 4.6+ after Germany is rock-solid.

## 14. Success metrics

After Wave 5 ships:

- BIM Diff: 1 M-element model diffs in ≤ 5 min (spec budget).
- Validation: importing a published IDS file and running it produces ≥ 95 % rule coverage match against the buildingSMART reference checker output.
- Classification: ≥ 80 % of elements auto-classified with confidence ≥ 0.85 across our 11 regional CWICR samples.
- QTO: BoQ exports validate against GAEB DA XML 3.3 XSD, AIA G703 schema, RICS NRM2 reference.
- AI Copilot: golden Q&A regression set scores ≥ 4.2 / 5 on LLM-as-judge eval; citation accuracy ≥ 95 %.

## 15. What I need to start

> The original 5 questions are kept below; questions 6–9 are added by the EAC v2 spec.

1. **Confirm wave priority** — strict L0→L5 sequential, or parallel after W0?
2. **Confirm new dependencies** — Celery (yes per L2), `bge-m3` (yes per L4), `simpleeval`, `python-magic`, `pyclamd` (gated). Any objections?
3. **Approve creating per-wave RFCs** — RFC 35 has now landed (EAC v2 platform — supersedes the planned RFC 38 + RFC 39 + adds Wave 6). Remaining: RFC 36 (Wave 0 foundation), RFC 37 (Wave 1 CDE close-out), RFC 38 (Wave 2 BIM Diff), RFC 40 (Wave 5 AI Copilot). Each lands at the start of its wave.
4. **Approve the verification-gate severity** — failing any of the 10 gates blocks merge. RFC 35 adds G11–G13 (schema parity, IDS round-trip parity, RLS-on-every-route).
5. **Decide demo path** — minimum-viable demo per the spec's "minimum viable chain" section: Wave 0 + W2.1 + W2.2 = 9 weeks; full Wave 0 + Wave 2 = 11 weeks; **EAC-led demo path** (Wave 0 + EAC-1 + EAC-3 + EAC-4) = 11 weeks and shows the unified rule editor + Excel import end-to-end.
6. **Confirm EAC-1 replaces Wave 3 entirely** — formally retire RFC 34 W3.1–W3.6 in favor of RFC 35 EAC-1.1..EAC-1.7 (already documented in §7 above).
7. **Confirm Wave 6 (4D, +5 weeks)** — adds 4 weeks net to the parallel timeline (16 → 18 weeks). OK?
8. **Confirm `eac_issues` separate from `PunchItem`** — bridged via `linked_punch_item_id`, or merge into `PunchItem`?
9. **Confirm clash mode deferred to EAC-1.6 spike** — block editor hides clash option until spike completes.

Once confirmed, RFC 36 (Wave 0) opens and EAC-1.1 (schema migration) starts in parallel with W0.1 (Celery + Redis).
