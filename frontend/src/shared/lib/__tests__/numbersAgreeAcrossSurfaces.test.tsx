// One amount, one reading, on every surface that shows it.
//
// The defect this was written from: the same record rendered `$180,174.28` on
// the bill of quantities and `180.174,28 $` on the finance register, inside one
// English UI. Nothing was random about it. The bill formats through
// `shared/lib/money`, which resolves the locale from the UI language, and the
// finance register formats through `<MoneyDisplay>`, which read a separate
// `numberLocale` preference whose default was the literal `'de-DE'`. Both
// surfaces were doing exactly what they were told; they were told different
// things.
//
// So this file asks the question the sibling gates cannot. They ask whether a
// call names a locale at all - `numbersAreWrittenInTheAppLanguage` catches the
// missing argument, `formattersReadTheLocalePerCall` catches the argument read
// once at chunk load. A call that confidently passes the WRONG locale satisfies
// both. That is the shape of this bug, and it is why finding it needed a
// screenshot rather than a gate.
//
// Two halves, in one file because they are one question:
//
//   * the rendering half checks that the money surfaces agree with the common
//     path, in a form derived from the locale rather than compared to a string.
//     A test that knows `$180,174.28` passes again the moment the seed amount
//     changes; a test that knows en-US groups with commas, points its decimals
//     and leads with the symbol keeps working on any amount.
//   * the census half checks that there is only one place the answer can come
//     from. Fixing the two rows in the screenshot would have left every other
//     surface free to invent its own locale, and we would be back here.

 * name this same file declares. A slot holding a function parameter defeats all
 * of it, because the answer was decided in another file by whoever called in.
 * That is not a corner: `measurement-format.ts` fell in it. Its formatters read
 * `new Intl.NumberFormat(locale, opts)` where `locale` is the parameter of a
 * caching helper, so for as long as those functions defaulted to the interface
 * language the gate looked straight at them and saw nothing to say.
 *
 * So the slot gets a class of its own for "could not resolve", and the census
 * prints it. An offender list is only an answer if you also know how much of
 * the population it was drawn from, and until this existed an empty list read
 * as "clean everywhere" when part of what it meant was "unread".
 *
 * Measured when written, on the whole tree: 108 `Intl.NumberFormat`, of which 93
 * reach the preference, 1 is a literal, 1 takes the browser default and 13 are
 * unresolved; and 19 `Intl.DateTimeFormat`, of which 8 reach the language, 1
 * takes the default and 10 are unresolved. The date side is mostly unresolved
 * because `formatters.ts` and the Gantt helpers take their locale as a
 * parameter, which is the correct shape for them and unreadable from here all
 * the same. Unreadable is not the same as wrong, and the census says unresolved
 * rather than anything stronger for that reason.

 * asked the formatting engine, and each file carried a comment arguing that it
 * was the correct one. They agreed on every currency the product offers except
 * the five in `ONCE_DISAGREED` above, where CLDR says the currency has no
 * subunit in circulation and ISO says it has two. So one amount read
 * `1234,50 Ft` on the finance register and `1235 Ft` on the bill, and both
 * files were right about their own rule.
 *
 * The tests above pin the outcome: those five codes, those two surfaces. That
 * is a fact about today and it is worth pinning, but it does not stop a third
 * surface from working the count out for itself tomorrow. This half pins the
 * property instead. Whatever the number turns out to be, one module derives it
 * and everything else asks that module, because a second source cannot
 * disagree with the first if it never gets written.
 *
 * The document half of the rule is deliberately out of scope here. An invoice
 * declares its amount to a bank and a tax office rather than to our user, so it

/**
 * A ceiling of two or more on the decimals with no floor under it.

 * takes the floor from the currency's own minor units and then clamps it down
 * to the ceiling if it sits above. So the ceiling changes nothing at all for a
 * currency with two - a euro amount of 1234.50 prints `1.234,50 €` with this
 * shape and without it - and it is wrong in both directions for every currency
 * that has a different number:
 *
 *   * a currency with none inherits a floor of zero and keeps the ceiling of
 *     two, so 1234.50 yen prints `1.234,5 ¥`, a tenth of a unit the yen does
 *     not have;
 *   * a currency with three has its floor clamped down to two, so the third
 *     digit of a dinar disappears.
 *
 * That EUR and USD are unaffected is what makes this worth a gate rather than a
 * grep. It reads as correct on the two currencies a developer is most likely to
 * open the page in, and a fixture in either of them passes against the broken
 * code, so the shape survives review and survives its own tests.
 *
 * A ceiling below two is a different statement and is not counted. Rounding a
 * chart axis or a headline tile to whole units, or to one decimal under compact
 * notation, is a decision about that tile taken by somebody who can see it, and
 * it is right for every currency rather than wrong for some of them. That is a
 * property of the number written down, not of which file wrote it, which is why
 * there is no list of blessed sites here: a sixth legitimate whole-unit tile
 * needs no permission from this file, and a sixth two-decimal ceiling gets none.
 *
 * THE FLOOR IS NOT PART OF THE RULE, and that is the part worth reading twice.
 * The shape has three spellings and a census that counted one of them was blind
 * to the other two: a literal ceiling, a ceiling behind an expression
 * (`compact ? 1 : 2`, found that way), and a ceiling of two under a floor of
 * zero. The third escapes a rule that wants no floor and escapes the pair
 * detector above, which wants two and two. It is not a milder version of the
 * other two either. On a currency with two minor units `minimumFractionDigits:
 * 0, maximumFractionDigits: 2` drops a digit the currency requires (1234.50
 * euro prints `1.234,5 €`); on a currency with none it invents one (`1.234,5
 * ¥`); on a currency with three it truncates. Three classes, three different
 * wrongs, and no reading under which it is right.
 *
 * So the rule is about the ceiling alone: a number of two or more, written down
 * at a call that serves whatever currency reaches it, is a claim about how many
 * minor digits that currency has - and only the currency knows that. Zero and
 * one are not that claim; they are claims about the tile, true for every
 * currency. That is why two is the boundary and why the floor does not enter.
 *
 * Stated that way ON PURPOSE, rather than as "a floor of zero is forbidden".
 * Somebody wanting a summary tile to drop the minor unit on a whole amount is
 * asking a real question, and it is the founder's open one. The honest spelling
 * of that wish is `minimumFractionDigits: 0` with no ceiling at all, or with a
 * ceiling the resolver supplies, and both pass this rule untouched. The gate
 * takes no position on the question; it only refuses the answer that hardcodes
 * the count.
 *
 * A rule of "the floor and the ceiling must not straddle the currency's own
 * count" was considered and does not survive contact with the tree: under
 * `maximumFractionDigits: 0` the engine defaults the floor to two on a euro and
 * clamps it down, which is a straddle by any literal reading and is exactly the
 * whole-unit tile this file deliberately spares. The wording would convict five
 * correct sites, so it is not the wording.
 *
 * Known false positive, unhit today and cheap to recognise when it lands: the
 * ceiling is read as "every number inside the expression", so an identifier
 * carrying a digit (`max2`, `DIGITS_2`) would be read as the number in it. The
 * answer then is to name the constant without the digit or to teach this reader
 * the constant, not to widen the rule.

/**
 * Why a one-sided digit override needs a fallback around it, and what "around"
 * can honestly be read to mean.
 *
 * A currency-styled formatter that writes one bound and leaves the other to the
 * currency is the only shape whose legality depends on the engine. The revision
 * that made a defaulted floor clamp down to a written ceiling is recent enough
 * that a desktop build on an older WebKit still reaches the previous rule, where
 * the same call is a `RangeError` thrown from inside render - the shape of issue
 * 391, and the reason `shared/lib/fractionDigits.ts` exists. Five of these
 * survive such an engine today only because each sits inside a try with a real
 * fallback, which nothing was checking and nobody had written down.
 *
 * WHICH ENGINE VERSION IS THE BOUNDARY IS NOT MEASURED. It is stated here as
 * unmeasured rather than rounded to safe. What is measured is that the desktop
 * build names a minimum system old enough to reach engines predating the
 * revision, that no browserslist or build target narrows that, and that the
 * clamp behaves on the engine this tree is developed against.
 *
 * The verdict is lexical and it is deliberately generous about where the
 * fallback lives, because the two shapes in this tree are not the same shape:
 * a catch that returns, and an empty catch with a comment whose function returns
 * below the try. The second is the better of the two and a rule demanding a
 * `return` inside the catch would convict it. So the question asked is "does the
 * catch path reach a value", answered as: there is a catch, it does not rethrow,
 * and a `return` exists either in the catch or between the catch and the end of
 * the enclosing function.
 *
 * The end of the function rather than the end of the nearest block, and that
 * distinction was not theoretical: the first version of this rule stopped at the
 * nearest brace and convicted `features/insights/charts.tsx`, whose try sits two
 * ifs deep with its fallback on the last line of the function. Control leaves
 * both of those blocks on the catch path, so a reader that stops at the first
 * one reports a correct site as exposed - the exact false conviction this rule
 * would be worthless with.
 *
 * WHAT IT CANNOT SEE, named rather than implied. It reads one function's text.
 * A formatter whose fallback lives one hop away in a helper, or whose only try
 * sits in a caller, reads as uncontained here and would have to be argued rather
 * than silently passed - which is the safe direction for this particular rule.
 *
 * Its scope is also narrower than the risk, on purpose but worth knowing: it
 * asks `digitBoundsOf`, which declines to speak about a formatter naming a
 * literal ISO code, and a one-sided override on a literal code would throw on an
 * old engine exactly the same way. There are none in this tree today - every one
 * of the fourteen currency-styled formatters takes its code from a variable - so
 * widening it now would be writing a rule against an empty set. If a literal one
 * appears, widen this rather than assuming it inherited the protection.
