"""Standing e-invoice configuration filling the gaps in one invoice's metadata.

Seller identity and the bank account are the same on every invoice a company
issues, so they belong to the instance rather than to the document. The document
still wins wherever it says something, because a value typed onto an invoice is
a deliberate departure from the standing configuration.

The checks that matter here are the ones a per-function test cannot see: the
validator and the renderer read the merged view through the same call, so a
merge that reached only one of them would let the panel report a document clean
and the download refuse to produce it.
