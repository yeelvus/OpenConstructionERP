// Case: "Start the works with the acta de comprobacion del replanteo" (ES).
//
// On a Spanish public works contract the plazo de ejecucion does not run from
// the award, from the signature or from the day the first lorry arrives. It
// runs from the acta de comprobacion del replanteo, the joint act in which the
// direccion facultativa and the contractor go to the site and confirm that the
// ground, the boundaries and the availability match the project. Everything
// downstream is dated from it, which is why the case spends its first step on
// the readiness that decides whether the act can be signed without reservas
// at all.

    "The comprobacion del replanteo is the moment a Spanish works contract becomes real. Until it is signed the contractor has an award and no obligation to be anywhere; from the day after, the plazo runs and every penalty for delay counts from it. That makes the act worth preparing rather than attending. Reservas raised in it about land not yet available, a service not diverted or a boundary that does not match the project are the cheapest reservas anyone will ever raise, because they are raised before the clock starts rather than claimed afterwards. The steps below get the evidence together first, put the signed act where it can be found in a year, and turn its date into the deadlines and the programme the contract asks for.",
