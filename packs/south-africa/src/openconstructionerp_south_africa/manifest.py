"""Build the ``PartnerPackManifest`` instance for the South Africa pack.

Kept in its own module so unit tests can import the manifest without
triggering the package ``__init__`` side-effects.

This is DataDrivenConstruction's first African market pack. It is built
entirely from public South African standards and regulations. The idea and
a reference implementation were contributed by Aidan Koetaan
(akoetaan@cut.ac.za); the implementation here is our own.
