# Portugal Construction Pack

Configures OpenConstructionERP for the Portuguese construction market. Estimating
practice in Portugal is structured around the orcamento (budget), with ProNIC
providing the national classification and specification framework for public
works. Currency is EUR with 23% IVA on construction services.

## What makes a Portuguese estimate Portuguese

A Portuguese orcamento (construction budget) for public works follows ProNIC
(Protocolo para a Normalizacao da Informacao Tecnica na Construcao), which
provides both a classification system and standard technical specifications.
ProNIC organises works into chapters and articles, and a public tender document
(caderno de encargos) that does not reference ProNIC codes is increasingly
unusual for works above the threshold.

Public procurement follows the Codigo dos Contratos Publicos (DL 18/2008),
which transposes the EU directives and governs the tendering process. Building
regulations are set by the RGEU (Regulamento Geral das Edificacoes Urbanas) and
the energy performance framework RCCTE/SCE. Structural design follows the NP EN
Eurocodes (Portuguese adoption).

IVA (Imposto sobre o Valor Acrescentado, VAT) on construction services is 23
percent at the standard rate, with a reduced 6 percent rate applying to certain
renovation and social housing works. The pack sets the `pt_iva_23` tax template.

## What this pack enables

- **Two demo projects**: an office building in Lisbon and a residential
  development in Porto, both priced at Portuguese 2026 market rates in EUR
  excluding IVA
- **ProNIC, CCP and LNEC regulatory references** in the pack metadata
