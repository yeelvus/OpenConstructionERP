/**
 * What makes one company profile different from the other twenty-one.
 *
 * The picker showed each profile's name, its sentence and a module count, and
 * a reader comparing two of them had three numbers and no way to learn what
 * the difference was made of. "General Contractor, 38 modules" and
 * "Construction Manager, 33 modules" are nearly the same set - measured, they
 * share twenty-eight - and the five that differ are the entire reason to pick
 * one over the other.
 *
 * Two questions, answered separately because they are asked at different
 * moments. Before choosing: what is this profile for, which is answered by the
 * modules few other profiles carry. While choosing: what happens to my
 * workspace, which is answered by the delta against the profile in force.
 *
 * Core modules are removed from every answer. Several presets re-list a core
 * key inside their own `enabled_modules` - `general_contractor` names `costs`,
 * `catalog` and `assemblies` - and a screen that subtracted one preset from
 * another without dropping those would report Projects or the cost database as
 * lost when nothing can lose them. The core list comes from the backend
 * (`GET /v1/users/onboarding-presets/core/`) rather than a copy here, because
 * a second copy is a second thing to keep in step.
