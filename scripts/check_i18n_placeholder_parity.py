"""i18n placeholder guard: block a translation that renamed a variable.

i18next substitutes by name. `t('boq.outline_count', { count: 12 })` fills
`{{count}}` and nothing else, so a locale whose value says `{{Pays}}` renders
the braces to the user, verbatim, forever. Nothing else we own can see it. The
key is present, so the orphan guard is happy. Both plural forms are present, so
the plural guard is happy. The value is not byte-identical to English, so the
leak baseline is happy. No escape was doubled. tsc and the build never read
locale content at all, and a string literal cannot fail to compile.

This is not hypothetical and it is not rare. Two ways it has happened here:

  * A spell-normalising pass walked the file and rewrote American spellings to
    British ones. It could not tell prose from a variable name, so `{{labor}}`
    became `{{labour}}` and `{{catalog}}` became `{{catalogue}}` in all
    forty-two translations and in `en.ts`. `en-US.ts` was the only file left
    holding the name the call site actually passes, which made the majority
    look correct and the single correct file look like the outlier.

  * A glossary pass replaced words with their translations and reached inside
    the braces, turning `{{count}}` into `{{Pays}}` across thirty-seven strings
    in one language, plural forms among them. A counted key with no `count` in
    it does not fall back to a sensible form, it has no number to switch on.

Both were mechanical, both were invisible to every other gate, and in both the
damage was proportional to how carefully the pass had been run everywhere.

What this checks, and deliberately no more. For each key, a locale may not ask
for a variable the source does not have. Not the order, which translation is
free to change, and not the formatter suffix in `{{value, currency}}`, which is
a rendering choice a locale may legitimately differ on. Only whether the string
demands something the call site was never written to pass.

The two directions are not the same defect and this guard treats them
differently, which is the whole of its accuracy.

  * A name the source does not have is unresolvable. There is no value to put
    there, so the reader gets braces. That is always broken and it blocks.

  * A name the source has and the locale omits still renders correctly; the
    string simply does not show that value. Sometimes it is a real loss and
    sometimes it is the right translation: in a language whose `_one` form
    means exactly one, Arabic among them, writing the word for "one" instead
    of `{{count}}` is better prose than the source has. A guard that failed on
    those would be wrong twice out of three times, measured on this tree, and a
    guard that is usually wrong gets switched off. So omissions are counted and
    printed on a passing run, where a person can look at them, and they do not
    fail the build.

Keys absent from the source are skipped: the source is what the call sites are
written against, and a key that exists only in a translation is the orphan
guard's business. Reporting it here would fail two gates for one cause.

There is no baseline file. There is nothing to grandfather: the parity holds
across every locale today, and a debt list here would be a place for exactly
the defect this guard exists to catch to sit and look approved.
