"""Embedded-PostgreSQL test lane (no Docker).

These tests run against a REAL PostgreSQL 16 cluster booted in-process from the
``pixeltable-pgserver`` wheel (bundled PG binaries). They guard the dialect
divergences that the default in-memory SQLite suite cannot catch: JSONB DDL and
operators, ILIKE case-insensitivity, GIN indexes, and UUID/JSONB asyncpg
round-trips.

Gating: the whole ``tests/pg`` directory is skipped unless ``OE_TEST_DB=pg`` is
set, so the normal SQLite run (and contributors without the wheel) are
unaffected. CI runs it via the dedicated *CI (PostgreSQL)* workflow.

Design notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~
* The cluster is booted ONCE per session and the full ORM schema is built ONCE
  with a synchronous psycopg2 engine (which fires the JSON->JSONB ``@compiles``
  hook and the ``after_create`` performance-index events). Doing the one-time
  setup synchronously sidesteps the pytest-asyncio "session-scoped async
  fixture is attached to a different event loop" pitfall.
* Per-test isolation: ``pg_session`` opens a connection, starts an outer
  transaction, binds the session with ``join_transaction_mode="create_savepoint"``
  (so the app's own ``commit()`` calls become savepoint releases) and rolls the
  whole thing back afterwards. Fast, and the shared schema is never mutated.

    A few subscribers are deliberately *detached*: they build a session from
    ``app.database.async_session_factory`` rather than reuse the publisher's,
    because the publisher is still inside its own request transaction. That is
    right in production and wrong here. This lane never binds that factory to
    the embedded cluster - ``pg_session`` hands out a savepoint-joined session
    built on its own connection - so a detached handler reaches for a database
    that is not there.

    The damage is not confined to the test that triggered it. The handler's
    half-opened connection outlives the failure, and on Windows the selector
    goes down with it, so every test that runs afterwards errors during setup.
    One write path with a detached consumer therefore reads as a broken suite:
    ``tests/pg`` was 160 passed without the invoice test and 13 failed plus 91
    errors with it, and only one of those failures was real.

    Take this fixture in a test that exercises a write path with a detached
    consumer and is asserting on the write rather than on the fan-out. The
    subscribers themselves are left alone: they are not the thing under test
    and they are not broken.
