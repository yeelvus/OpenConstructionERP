"""Pure contractual notice and time-bar clock engine.

Missing a contractual notice deadline can forfeit an entire claim or an
extension-of-time entitlement: a FIDIC claim-notice window, an NEC compensation
event notification, a JCT delay notice, an AIA claim window. This engine turns
the event date already recorded on a change / variation / EOT record into a
countdown: it adds the applicable notice or response period, produces the
deadline, and classifies where the clock stands (met / upcoming / due-soon /
overdue). It is the deterministic core behind a per-project "notice register".

The mapping from a contract standard to its notice periods is a code-level
config (:data:`NOTICE_PERIODS`): a small table of standard -> {notice_type:
period_days}. The standards named here (FIDIC, NEC, JCT, AIA, ConsensusDocs) are
international contract standards, named as such; none is a commercial product.
The day counts encode the well-known windows for each standard and are documented
inline; a deployment can localise them without touching the engine's logic.

Calendar days and working days
------------------------------
A notice period is either a run of calendar days or a run of working days, and
which one it is moves the deadline by several days on any period long enough to
cross a weekend. Every period therefore carries a basis alongside its day count
(:data:`NOTICE_PERIOD_BASES`), and the counting itself is done by
:func:`app.core.day_basis.add_days` - the same function the statutory payment
clock counts with, so the two engines cannot drift apart. Working days are
Monday to Friday minus a calendar the deployment supplies; no holiday list is
shipped here, for the reasons argued in that module.

No database, no ORM, no ``app.modules.*`` imports - the standard library plus
that one pure ``app.core`` helper, which itself imports nothing but the standard
library - so it unit-tests on the local runner exactly like the cycle-time, SLA
and dispute-risk engines. It reads no clock: the caller supplies ``now`` and the
already-parsed dates, so identical inputs always produce an identical register.

Proof of notice
---------------
For a notice that must actually be served (a claim notice, an EOT notice) the
caller passes ``proof_on_file`` - whether a matching notice document was found in
the correspondence record. A required notice with nothing on file is flagged
:attr:`NoticeClock.entitlement_at_risk` regardless of the internal status,
because a change proceeding with no notice on file is the classic way an
entitlement is lost. Response-style clocks (a quotation window, an assessment
window, an early-warning response) do not require a served notice and are never
flagged for a missing proof document.

# excludes public holidays from a reckoned period, which is
