"""ABS records written here, from the format rules, for these tests.

These are ours. Nothing below is copied from anybody's document. Every record
was written from the rules stated in
:mod:`app.modules.rebar_schedule.abs_format` - the block grammar, the header
field order, the applicability table per super-group - and every number in it
follows from something a reader can check:

* Bar weights are the length in metres times the mass per metre of the
  diameter, taking steel at 7850 kg/m3: 0.888 kg/m at 12 mm, 0.617 at 10 mm,
  0.222 at 6 mm, 0.154 at 5 mm.
* Bending rollers are four times the bar diameter, which is the smallest
  roller DIN 488 allows below 20 mm: 48 mm for a 12 mm bar, 40 mm for a 10 mm
  bar.
* The developed length in a header is the sum of the geometry's legs, an arc
  contributing ``radius * angle`` in radians. That is what
  ``bvbs_abs.developed_length_matches_header`` checks, so the two agree here by
  construction rather than by luck.
* Grades, mesh types and the like are standard designations or plainly
  invented names. No product of any manufacturer is named.

The corpus proves itself. Every ABS record ends with a checksum over its own
characters, ``96 - (sum of the ASCII values through the C of the checksum
block) mod 32``, so a record can be shown correct on its own without any
outside copy to compare it against. :func:`_prove` runs that check over every
record at import, which means a typo in this file fails the whole module at
collection rather than one test somewhere downstream.

What the corpus deliberately gets wrong, and why
------------------------------------------------
Two entries carry a defect on purpose. Both existed to stop a later reader
loosening a rule to accommodate a record that does not conform, and both keep
that job without needing anyone's record to point at.

:data:`HEADER_INCOMPLETE` names the one record whose header omits fields its
super-group requires, the weight ``e`` and the author ``v``. It is here so the
whole-file tests have something to import that goes red, and so the header rule
can be held to the standard's text - every applicable identifier present, even
when the value is empty - with a test that pins which record is short and by
what. A rule relaxed to let this record through would be caught immediately.

:data:`BFGT_MISSTATED_CHECKSUM` is a lattice girder whose checksum block states
a value its own characters do not produce. The standard's checksum table does
not mark BFGT as carrying a checksum block, which invites a reader to exempt
the super-group from the check altogether; this record is here so that exemption
cannot be made quietly.
