"""The desktop bundle must ship the runtime data the wheel force-includes.

A wheel and a frozen sidecar are two ways of shipping one backend, and they
collect files by two unrelated mechanisms. Hatchling walks the ``app`` package
and adds whatever ``force-include`` names on top of it; PyInstaller adds only
what ``desktop/pyinstaller.spec`` lists. Anything the runtime reads from a path
that resolves OUTSIDE the ``app`` package therefore has to be named twice, once
in each file, and until this test there was nothing that made the second naming
happen.

It is written against a failure that reached users. ``app/core/i18n.py``
resolves its catalogue as a ``locales`` directory sitting NEXT TO the ``app``
package, the wheel force-included it, and the spec never did, so no desktop
build had ever carried it. That stayed invisible while a missing catalogue was
a warning that refilled the directory from an embedded copy, and became a
sidecar that exits during startup the moment refilling was correctly replaced
by a hard error. Both halves were defensible on their own; nothing compared
them.

The spec is executed rather than read. A test that greps the spec for a path
passes on a spec that computes the same path and then never appends it, which
is the failure mode being guarded against, so the real module runs with the
PyInstaller API stubbed out and the assertions read the list it actually built.

Blind spot, stated here rather than left to be rediscovered: the denominator is
the wheel's force-include map. A path the runtime reads that is missing from
BOTH files has no anchor and is invisible to this test.

A path may be force-included into the wheel and deliberately left out of the
frozen bundle. Those live in ``_NOT_FROZEN_INTO_THE_DESKTOP_BUNDLE`` below,
each with its reason attached to the entry rather than described here. That
placement is deliberate too: this docstring used to carry the reasoning for the
alembic case, it went stale the day the wheel started force-including the tree,
and a stale docstring is exactly how a decision becomes invisible. Reasons that
have to stay true belong next to the thing that makes them testable.
