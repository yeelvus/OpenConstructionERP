"""Serve frontend static files from the installed package or dev build.

# SPA fallback) derive ``Content-Type`` from the stdlib ``mimetypes`` table.
# That table is seeded from the host OS, and on a fresh wheel install it does
# NOT reliably contain ``.mjs`` (Python only added it to the bundled table in
# recent 3.x point releases), while the Windows registry has historically
# mapped ``.js`` to ``text/plain``.  When the worker chunk
# ``/assets/pdf.worker.min-<hash>.mjs`` is then served as ``text/plain`` or
# ``application/octet-stream`` the browser refuses the module import and
# pdf.js fails with "Setting up fake worker failed: Failed to fetch
# dynamically imported module" on /takeoff.  Registering the types here makes
# every served build deterministic regardless of the host's registry state.
# Same root cause as the earlier Vite-PWA ``sw.js`` / ``registerSW.js`` fix.
