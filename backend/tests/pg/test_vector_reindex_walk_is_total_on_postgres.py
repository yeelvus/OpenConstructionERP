"""The paged reindex walk, against real PostgreSQL and a real Session.

The unit test beside this one replaces the session with a recorder, which is
what makes its peak measurable - but a recorder agrees with whatever the code
asks it for. Three things it cannot answer live here instead: that
``OFFSET/LIMIT`` over a statement that JOINs through a parent table returns each
row once and all of them, that a real ``Session`` really does let go of a page
when it is expunged, and that the ``selectinload`` on the parent still fires on
every page - the requirement's parent is ``lazy="raise_on_sql"``, so a page that
lost its eager load raises the moment the adapter reads it rather than quietly
issuing another query.

The scope under test is the real one the requirements module registers, not a
copy of it. The last test covers the same three questions for BOQ positions,
which do not come through the factory at all - the endpoint is hand-written
around its own ownership gate - but do share the walk, and are the highest-count
rows in the product, so the eager parent they read through (``Position.boq``,
also ``raise_on_sql``) is the one that costs most if paging breaks it.

The identity map is sampled DURING the pass, from inside the indexing call,
because it holds instances weakly: once the handler returns, the rows it was
holding are garbage whatever shape the read had, and a measurement taken then
would report the same small number for a buffered read and a paged one.
