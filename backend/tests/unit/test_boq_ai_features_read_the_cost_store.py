"""The BOQ editor's readiness gate stands for features that read the cost store.

`BOQEditorPage` gates three actions behind `vectorReady`, which it computes
from the `cost_items` vector count reported by `/v1/costs/vector/status/`.
That gate is CORRECT and this file exists to keep it correct.

It is worth stating why, because the opposite was reported and believed for
a while. The page also hosts element matching, which searches the
per-language `cwicr_*_v3` catalogue collections, so a reader who judges the
gate by what the page is about concludes it probes the wrong store. It does
not. Rate suggestion, classification and anomaly checking all reach
``app.core.vector.vector_search``, which queries ``COST_TABLE``. The gate
reads exactly the store its own three features search, and the setup modal a
user meets after restoring only a catalogue snapshot is telling the truth:
those three really are unavailable.

So the failure this pins is somebody "fixing" working code. Repoint one of
the three at the catalogue store, or repoint ``vector_search`` itself, and
the frontend gate silently stops matching what it gates - with no test
failing anywhere, because each half looks reasonable alone.

The frontend half is deliberately absent, and that is a gap rather than an
oversight. It would have to assert that `vectorReady` derives from the
`cost_items` probe and that the setup modal still appears when that count is
low even while catalogues are installed. Expressing it means either
extracting the gate from a 5,816-line component or rendering the whole
thing; `BOQEditorPage.test.tsx`, despite its name, renders nothing and only
exercises pure helpers. The cost was judged not worth what it would catch,
given that this file covers the more consequential direction.

On evidence, since the tests here are proved two different ways. The two
driven tests were proved red the ordinary way, by repointing
``vector_search`` at ``cwicr_en_v3``: both failed on the collection name and
the file restored clean. The two AST tests were not proved that way, because
doing so means editing a 5,816-line service other agents are working in, to
demonstrate something an injection into a shared file is a poor way to
demonstrate. They were proved by showing the predicate separates instead -
the counts are in each test's docstring. That is weaker than a red run for
the specific method and stronger than a red run for showing the predicate is
not vacuous, so it is stated rather than glossed.
