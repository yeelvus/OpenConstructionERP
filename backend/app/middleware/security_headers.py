"""Security response headers middleware.

Adds the standard set of defensive HTTP response headers:
  - X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN      (clickjacking; allows same-origin PDF preview)
  - X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff  (MIME sniffing)
  - Referrer-Policy: same-origin     (referrer leakage)
  - Strict-Transport-Security        (HSTS - production only)
  - Content-Security-Policy          (XSS / injection - relaxed for SPA)
  - Permissions-Policy               (feature gating)

Also strips the `server: uvicorn` header that the ASGI server adds by default,
to avoid leaking the underlying tech stack.

        # WebGL-tainted), which is governed by ``connect-src`` - NOT
        # ``img-src``. Without the host on ``connect-src`` every tile request
        # is blocked ("Connecting to ... violates ... connect-src") and the

        #   * ``frame-src`` must allow ``data:`` / ``blob:`` - it was previously
        #     unset, so the browser fell back to ``default-src 'self'`` and the
        #     preview iframe rendered blank.
        #   * ``frame-ancestors`` is INHERITED by the framed ``data:``/``blob:``
        #     document, so ``'none'`` made that document refuse to be embedded by
        #     its own (same-origin) parent. ``'self'`` still blocks cross-origin
        #     clickjacking while letting the app frame its own previews.

        # typefaces from ``/assets/vendor/fonts/``, so ``'self'`` on font-src
        # and style-src covers them, and the service worker precaches them as
        # ordinary same-origin build output. The Google Fonts hosts used to sit
        # on style-src, font-src and connect-src (the last because Workbox
        # precached the files with ``fetch()``, which connect-src governs).
