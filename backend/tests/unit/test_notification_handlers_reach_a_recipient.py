"""Every notification handler must reach a recipient from its publisher's payload.

A subscriber that reads ``event.data["winner_user_id"]`` when its publisher
never emits that key resolves nobody and sends nothing. Nothing fails, nothing
is logged, and the feature is simply absent. Reading the handler does not catch
it, because the handler is correct in isolation; only running it against the
payload its publisher actually emits does.

THE PROPERTY, asserted per handler rather than over a fixed set. Each handler
is executed twice:

    A  payload restricted to the keys this event's publisher emits
    B  payload containing every key the handler reads             (the control)

A handler is BROKEN when B produces a notification and A does not. The control
is what makes this evidence rather than a lint: without it a handler that
notifies nobody under any payload would be indistinguishable from one starved
by its publisher. Because the rule is a property of one handler, a new handler
added later is covered without anyone editing a list.

WHY NOT A CHEAPER RULE. Relaxing A to "keys any publisher anywhere emits"
removes the need to parse each event's payload and was measured rather than
assumed: it disagrees with A on 8 of 26 handlers, every time by calling a
broken handler fine. There are ~590 distinct published key names, so common
ones like ``created_by`` and ``actor_id`` are always emitted by something.

WHAT THIS TEST CANNOT SEE, stated because a green run must not be read as
coverage it does not claim. Publisher discovery is static and misses three
shapes, each found the hard way:

  1. the event name passed as a constant - ``_safe_publish(ev.STOCK_LOW, ...)``
     rather than a string literal;
  2. the payload built in a variable or with ``{**base, ...}`` rather than
     written as a literal dict at the call site;
  3. (fixed, kept as a warning) the publish call reached through a wrapper such
     as ``_safe_publish`` or ``_emit``. Wrappers are now discovered by checking
     that they forward their own event-name parameter to a bus primitive, but a
     wrapper taking the name any other way is still invisible.

A handler whose publisher is invisible for those reasons is NOT exempted and
NOT called a defect - the instrument simply has no verdict about it. Those are
counted and named by :data:`_OPAQUE_PUBLISHER` at run time. The number of
handlers this test can actually decide is therefore ratcheted too: extracting
an event name to a constant would otherwise drop a handler out of coverage and
make this test quietly greener.

WHAT A GREEN RUN CLAIMS, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT. The rule is that a handler
reaches at least ONE recipient. That is the right rule for a gate about
starved payloads, and it is exactly why a pass here must never be read as "this
feature works". A handler written to tell three people and now reaching two of
them passes, correctly, because the payload no longer starves it - and the
third person is still not told. ``_on_bid_awarded`` is the live example: it
reaches the buyer and the awarding user, and cannot reach the winning bidder,
because no user id for a bidder exists anywhere in the schema. That is not a
flaw in this test, it is the boundary of what it asserts, and boundaries that
are not written down get exceeded by the next reader.

THE DATABASE. The sweep hands every handler a throwaway database carrying the
full schema and no rows, so a handler that loads the row its event points at
finds nothing and returns, rather than dying on a missing relation. Both end in
"this handler sent nothing", which is exactly why it matters that only one of
them is a fact about the handler: against a database with no schema, whether a
handler read as database-bound or as working depended on whether an earlier test
in the same session had happened to build one.

THE BUS, checked so the payloads above are the payloads handlers really get.
There is one ``EventBus``, no serialization anywhere in the publish path, and
``publish_detached`` is ``asyncio.create_task`` on the same loop - so a value
arrives as the type it was published as, in dev and in production alike, with
no JSON round trip to turn a UUID into a string. Every handler also receives
the *same* ``Event`` object, with no per-handler copy, so a handler that
mutated ``event.data`` would change what later handlers see;
:func:`test_a_handler_does_not_mutate_the_shared_payload` pins that.
