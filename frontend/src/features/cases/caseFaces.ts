// Cases - photography plumbing shared by every future card/picker variant.
//
// The marketing site already puts a person on every case card and detail hero
// (marketing-site/scripts/put_case_face.py). This module mirrors that script's
// casting logic so the app and the site show the SAME person for the same
// role: `ROLE_CAST` is copied verbatim from the script's ROLE_CAST, and
// `caseFaceFor` reproduces its `deal()` round-robin (position within the
// role, `cast[index % cast.length]`).
//
// The images live under `frontend/public/assets/people/` and are addressed by
// runtime path strings on purpose: 58 webp files as Vite imports would bloat
// the module graph, while public-dir paths stay lazy and cacheable.
//
//   prf-*.webp  340x480 role portraits (the pooled cast)

//   cmt-*.webp  128x128 square crops of those scenes, for small tiles
//   pbk-*.webp  200x300 bespoke photos for ten flagship cases
