"""app.core.regional_packs - resolve a project's regional pack at runtime.

A regional pack declares what a market expects: its currency, its date and
number formats, its standards, and - the part this module serves - its
``measurement_system``. Until now every one of those values was readable only
through the pack's own ``GET /config/`` endpoint, so a pack changed what an
API caller could *see* and never what the platform *did*.

This module is the lookup that closes that gap for the measurement system. It
reads the packs' own identity fields rather than a hand-written country table:
each pack declares ``countries`` (ISO 3166-1 alpha-2) and ``region_code``, and
a project carries ``country_code`` and ``region``. Country is tried first
because it is the explicit ISO-2 column; ``region`` is free text that the
schema deliberately leaves open to any market, so it is only ever matched as
an exact fallback against a pack's own ``region_code``.

Resolution is deliberately conservative. A country claimed by several packs
resolves only when those packs agree - the three US packs all declare
``imperial``, so ``"US"`` is unambiguous, while a disagreement would return
``None``. Anything unrecognised also returns ``None``, which callers must
treat as "not configured" rather than as a default.

The same lookup serves a pack's ``progress_billing`` figures (retention,
release events, stored materials, subcontractor payment evidence, billing
cycle, change-line codes) through :func:`resolve_progress_billing`. Those are
money figures, so that resolver is stricter still: it reads national packs
only and a block keyed by the exact country, so a pack that claims several
countries can never lend one country's figures to another.
