Authorisation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Every route resolves the caller before it touches data, and every one of them
routes through the service's two gates:

* Reads require project access (owner, system admin, or a member). Denial and
  "no such project" are both 404, so an id cannot be walked.
* Writes require project ownership or system-admin. A caller who can see the
  project gets 403 (they already know it exists, so nothing leaks); a caller
  who cannot gets 404.

A team, a membership or a restriction belonging to another project always
answers 404 rather than 403, for the same reason.

The app runs with ``redirect_slashes=False`` (see ``app/main.py``), so each
collection route is registered in both its bare and its trailing-slash form,
with the alias kept out of the schema.
