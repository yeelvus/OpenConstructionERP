"""Defects-liability Pydantic v2 schemas (request / response models).

Calendar dates cross the wire as ISO-8601 strings (``YYYY-MM-DD``) and are typed
as :class:`datetime.date` on create/update so Pydantic parses and validates them.
The register and readiness responses report their derived percentages
(``overall_health_score``, per-subcontractor ``health_score``) as plain decimal
strings (``None`` meaning "undefined", e.g. an empty register) via field
serialisers, so no float rounding is introduced at the API edge, mirroring the
money-as-string convention used across the platform. Other derived views (counts,
expiring / expired / overdue / ready lists) come straight from the dicts produced
by the pure :mod:`app.modules.defects_liability.register` core.

The warranty-type / status / defect-status / severity vocabularies are the single
source of truth in :mod:`app.modules.defects_liability.register`; the ``Literal``
types below enumerate the same values so an out-of-vocabulary value is rejected at
the edge (422).
