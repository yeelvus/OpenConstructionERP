"""Document appearance: the stored look of every generated PDF.

The test that matters most here is :func:`test_the_defaults_are_what_the_consumers_had_hard_coded`.
Making the look configurable meant lifting values out of the modules that drew
with them, and the whole promise of that change is that a workspace which never
opens the settings page gets the same document it got before. That promise is
kept by four numbers agreeing, and nothing else in the codebase checks that they
still do - so a well-meaning tidy-up of a default here would silently restyle
every contract, receipt and certificate in every deployment.
