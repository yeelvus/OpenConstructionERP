  // Self-mapping rather than absent so that the decision is written where the
  // next person looks for it. `LOCALE_MAP[lang] || lang` gives the same string
  // either way, and the contract to pin is `getIntlLocale() === 'en'`, not the
  // shape of this map: an absent key would also be produced by somebody
  // deleting a line, which is not a decision anybody made.

  // What `Intl` does with it, measured rather than assumed (ICU 78): `en`
  // resolves to `en`, prints `3/14/2026` and `$1,234.50`, and starts its week
  // on Sunday - byte for byte what `en-US` prints. CLDR has no region-free
  // English; unqualified `en` inherits the American reading, and `en-001` is
  // the world region rather than no region. So this is neutral in what it
  // claims, not in what it renders, and the honest way to give a reader the
  // British reading is the `en-GB` entry in the picker, not a quiet
  // reinterpretation of the entry they did not qualify.
