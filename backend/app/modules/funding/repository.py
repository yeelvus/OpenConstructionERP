"""Public funding data access layer.

Two shapes of repository live here. ``ProgrammeRepository`` reads reference
data shared by every project. The other four read records that belong to one
application, and they are alike enough that they share a base class rather
than repeating the same six methods four times.

Every method that returns records belonging to an application takes the
application id, never an optional filter. A list endpoint whose scope is
optional eventually gets called without it, and in this module that would
hand one applicant another applicant's award.

        holds, so a reader is told there is a second page instead of finding
        out by asking for one.

        The count and the page are built from a single ``where`` held in a
        local, not from two clauses written out one after the other. Two
        clauses drift the moment somebody narrows one of them, and the drift
        is silent: a total taken over a wider set than the page reads as
        "there is more" forever, and a total taken over a narrower one hides
        rows the page is already returning.

        ``list_for_application`` is deliberately left answering with

        rows sharing one of those come back in whatever order the database
        chose; under a LIMIT that ordering is free to differ between two
