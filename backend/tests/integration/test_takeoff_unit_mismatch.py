"""Integration test: takeoff service raises 422 unit_system_mismatch.

Wave 24 (#167) — assert that persisting a metric takeoff measurement into
an imperial project raises HTTP 422 with code='unit_system_mismatch'.

The test calls TakeoffService.create_measurement() directly (not via HTTP)
so it gets a real DB-backed session but avoids routing concerns.

The service side of this was never written, and two of the three tests below
have been red in the nightly ever since. They are marked ``xfail(strict=True)``
rather than deleted, because the contract they describe is worth keeping in
front of whoever decides the question, and strict means the mark turns red the
day somebody implements it instead of quietly passing.

The gap is wider than a missing keyword argument, which is why this is a
product question and not a test fix. ``TakeoffService.create_measurement`` has
no ``source_unit_system`` parameter, and ``unit_system_mismatch`` appears
nowhere in ``app/``. Adding the parameter alone would still not satisfy the
422 case: ``Project`` has no ``unit_system`` column, ``ProjectCreate`` declares
no such field and sets no ``extra=``, so the ``"unit_system": "imperial"``
this file posts is silently dropped, and the platform resolves a project's
measurement system from its regional pack instead - see
``resolve_measurement_system`` in ``app/core/regional_packs.py``, whose
docstring says ``None`` means "no pack answered" and must not be defaulted. A
project created with no country therefore resolves to ``None``, and there is
nothing for a metric measurement to mismatch against. Passing these two tests
needs a stored ``unit_system`` column and a migration, which is a different
answer to "where does a project's measurement system live" than the one the
validation layer already uses. That decision is not a test's to make.
