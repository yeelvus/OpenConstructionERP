"""A cost-file import must hand rows to the service in bounded slices.

The upload cap on this endpoint is 100 MB, which is well over a million rows of
CSV. Turning every one of them into a schema object before the first insert
meant the file existed several times over at the peak - the parsed rows, the
schema objects built from them, and the ORM instances the service built from
those. On a server with 3 GB of RAM the kernel kills the process there, and
because that is a SIGKILL the operator sees a server that stopped rather than an
import that failed.

The bound is checked by watching the sizes the service is called with rather
than by measuring memory. The slice size is what this code decides; resident
memory is decided by the allocator, the CSV reader and the garbage collector as
well, and a test that measured it would fail for reasons that had nothing to do
with this loop.

Two of the tests are the control. One runs the same import with the bound raised
out of reach, which is what removing the hand-over would look like from inside
the loop, and asserts the single unbounded batch that would then appear. The
other puts a duplicate code across a slice boundary: slicing moves that row from
the service's in-memory duplicate set onto its database lookup, so the reported
counts have to come out the same either way or the bound changed behaviour
rather than only peak memory.

No database is involved: the service is replaced by a recorder that models the
one contract the router depends on - a code already created is not created
again, whichever call first carried it.
