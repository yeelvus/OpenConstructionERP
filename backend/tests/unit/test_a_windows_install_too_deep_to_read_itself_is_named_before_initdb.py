"""A Windows path over MAX_PATH is named, not reported as a corrupted install.

Windows caps a fully qualified path at 259 characters for programs that do not
declare long-path support, and the bundled PostgreSQL binaries do not declare it,
so the machine-wide LongPathsEnabled switch does nothing for them. An
installation deep enough to push its own support files past that cap therefore
cannot open them, and ``initdb`` reports them as missing::

    initdb: error: file ".../pginstall/share/postgresql/postgres.bki" does not exist
    initdb: hint: This might mean you have a corrupted installation or identified
            the wrong directory with the invocation option -L.

Measured on a real 16.8.0 install from PyPI: the support directory was 257
characters, ``postgres.bki`` under it 270, the file present and 944104 bytes, and
readable by any long-path-aware tool. Nothing downstream could tell that apart
from a damaged wheel, so the reader was told their installation might be corrupt
and sent to ``--force-reinstall``, which downloads 84 MB into the same directory
to fail the same way.

These tests drive the arithmetic against synthetic paths that are never created
on disk, and the platform gate through :func:`path_limit_applies`, so they run
and mean the same thing on Linux and macOS, where the whole feature must stay a
no-op and where nearly all of our CI runs.
