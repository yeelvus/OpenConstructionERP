"""Subcontractors agreements IDOR regression suite (issue #29).

A ``Subcontractor`` is a GLOBAL, tenant-shared registry entry (no
``project_id``); only its ``Agreement`` rows carry a ``project_id`` and
hold the commercial terms (title, total value, retention, notes). The
list endpoint

    GET /api/v1/subcontractors/agreements/?subcontractor_id=<S>

gates the ``project_id`` branch with ``verify_project_access`` but, pre-fix,
the ``subcontractor_id`` branch returned **every** agreement for that
subcontractor across **every** project - so any tenant that shares a
subcontractor with a competitor could read the competitor's rates and
contract values just by passing the shared subcontractor id.

The fix scopes the ``subcontractor_id`` branch to the projects the caller
may access via ``accessible_project_ids`` (admins stay unfiltered). Unlike
the by-id vectors this endpoint returns a filtered **200**, never a leak.

The attacker B is a manager (clears the subcontractors.create RBAC gate so
it can seed its own agreement, but is not an admin, so it stays scoped).

Runs against the shared ``tests/conftest.py`` PostgreSQL cluster.
