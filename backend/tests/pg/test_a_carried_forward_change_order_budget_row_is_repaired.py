"""Budget delta rows written by 17.7.0 and 17.7.1 are put back into delta shape.

Those two releases wrote a change order's budget row with the project budget
carried forward as ``original`` and ``revised`` as that plus the effect, and
the dashboard aggregate sums every row, so each such row added the whole
project budget a second time. The create path is fixed; this is the other half,
the rows already on file. The boot-path repair rewrites a row only when it
carries the exact 17.7.x signature:

* it is linked to a change order through ``metadata.change_order_id``,
* that change order went through approval (``approved`` or ``executed``),
* ``original`` is not zero,
* ``revised - original`` is exactly the change order's ``cost_impact``.

Everything else is somebody's data and is left alone, which is why most of this
file is rows that must come out byte for byte as they went in: a correct delta
row, a baseline row whose numbers happen to look the same, a change order row
whose difference does not match, and a row pointing at a change order that was
never approved.
