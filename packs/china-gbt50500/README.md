# China Construction Pack (中国建筑工程包)

A pre-configured workspace for contractors and developers pricing work in
mainland China: Simplified Chinese interface, CNY, the VAT general tax method,
Shanghai cost data, and a Shanghai office-tower demo project priced to
GB 50500-2013.

## What makes a Chinese bill Chinese

Four things, and each of them is a place where a bill prepared to European or
North American habits comes out wrong rather than merely unfamiliar.

**A tender price is five bills, not one.** They are summed in a fixed order:
measured works (分部分项), measure items (措施项目), other items (其他项目),
statutory charges (规费) and tax (税金). Importing a Chinese tender as a flat
list of measured works loses the whole of the preliminaries and the whole of
the statutory content. On a building job that is not a rounding difference.

**Two of those five are not competitive.** The statutory charges and the safe
and civilised construction fee are set by the rules in force and may not be
discounted to win work, because both are money that leaves the contractor for
somebody else: social insurance for the workforce, and the physical safety
provisions on site. A bid that shaves them is non-responsive, not merely
aggressive. This is the commonest single way a foreign-prepared Chinese bid is
disqualified.

**The comprehensive unit rate is comprehensive in a limited sense.** 综合单价
carries labour, materials, plant, the enterprise management fee, profit and an
agreed slice of risk. It does not carry the statutory charges and it does not
carry the tax. Reading it as an all-in rate under-reads the tender by the whole
of bills four and five.

**The quantity is net.** It is computed by the calculation code and is the same
number for every tenderer. Waste, laps, working space and battering are priced
inside the rate, not added to the quantity. A tenderer who adds waste to the
quantity has changed a number that was supposed to be identical across bids.

## The item code

Twelve digits, of which only the first nine are national.

| digits | 中文 | what it is |
|---|---|---|
| 1-2 | 工程分类顺序码 | engineering category from the appendix; 01 is buildings and decoration |
| 3-4 | 专业工程顺序码 | professional works within that category |
| 5-6 | 分部工程顺序码 | division |
| 7-9 | 分项工程项目名称顺序码 | the national item name, and the end of the fixed part |
| 10-12 | 清单项目名称顺序码 | assigned by whoever compiles the bill, 001 upward, unique within it |

`010101001001` is site clearance and grading, first occurrence in this bill.
Two bills for the same work will legitimately carry different twelve-digit
codes and identical nine-digit prefixes, which is the part that surprises
readers used to a fixed national code.

Every bill item also needs five elements, and the third is the one that
matters: 项目编码, 项目名称, **项目特征**, 计量单位, 工程量. The rate is
priced against the characteristics, and a settlement dispute turns on them. An
item written without them is not a priced item, it is an argument deferred.

## Which edition

The pack states GB 50500-2013, because that is the edition the shipped item
codes were authored against and the only text we have. GB/T 50500-2024
superseded it from 2025-09-01, along with the GB/T 50854-2024 measurement
family. Neither text could be obtained, so the pack does not claim conformance
to them.

Note the prefix when reading the two. The 2013 edition is **GB**, a mandatory
code. The 2024 edition is **GB/T**, a recommended standard.

## Two spellings, one standard, and they are not interchangeable

`gbt50500` is the engine rule set: the rule ids, the `standard` attribute on
the rule classes, the validation message keys, and the entry in
`validation_rule_sets`.

`gb50500` is the classification standard: what the registry calls it, what
`classification_order` hands to the section path builder, and therefore the key
a cost item's `classification` dict has to use.

The demo bills were keyed with the rule set name until 2026-08. The two rules
read them correctly and no Chinese cost item ever produced a section path,
because a missing section path is an empty string and an empty string is what
an unclassified line looks like. Bills stored before that change still
validate: the rules read either spelling.

## Tax

Priced tax-exclusive (除税价), with the tax added as bill five.

| method | 中文 | rate | when |
|---|---|---|---|
| general | 一般计税方法 | 9% | construction services in general, with input VAT credited |
| simplified | 简易计税方法 | 3% | labour-only contracts, employer-supplied-material contracts, and old projects, at the contractor's election |

The 9 percent figure is the rate since 2019-04-01. It was 11 percent from 2016
and 10 percent from 2018-05-01, so an older bill carrying a different number is
not wrong. Which method applies is a property of the contract rather than of
the work, and a contractor can be running both at once on different jobs.

## What ships

| | |
|---|---|
| Interface | Simplified Chinese (`zh`), English available |
| Currency | CNY |
| Tax template | `cn_vat_9` |
| Methodology | `china`, derived from the regional markup table |
| Cost data | `cwicr-zh-shanghai`; Beijing, Shenzhen, Guangzhou and Chengdu are listed as preferred metros and arrive in marketplace updates |
| Demo project | `office-shanghai`, a 32-storey Grade A tower in Lujiazui, measured works approx. CNY 690 million |
| Engine rules | `gbt50500`: item code present, and 9 or 12 numeric digits |
| Reference documents | seven, listed below |

## Reference documents

Read by a person, not by the engine. Each carries a `review_status` saying how
far it has been checked, because the reader is deciding whether to price a
tender against it.

| document | subject |
|---|---|
| `cn_gb50500_qingdan_bianma` | the twelve-digit item code and the five required elements |
| `cn_qingdan_wubu_jiegou` | the five bills a tender price is made of |
| `cn_zonghe_danjia` | what the comprehensive unit rate contains, and what it does not |
| `cn_gb50854_gongchengliang` | net measurement, and where the waste goes instead |
| `cn_guifei_anquanwenming` | the two fees that may not be discounted |
| `cn_zengzhishui_jianzhu` | VAT: general method and simplified method |
| `cn_zhaobiao_jiesuan` | the bid ceiling, and how the price moves after award |

## How far this has been reviewed

The item code structure and the five-bill structure are derived from
GB 50500-2013 read in full for the structures it states. The remaining
documents are drawn from the published codes and from public statutory sources
and are marked as pending review by a Chinese cost engineer (造价工程师) before
they are relied on for a tender. The fee percentages offered in the onboarding
wizard are defaults for Shanghai practice and are not a substitute for the
provincial fee schedule in force, which is where the real numbers live.
