"""Fail the build if a proprietary classification leaks into shippable files.

The licensing position is that division NUMBERS are interoperability facts and stay,
while the official division TITLES are the licensor's expression and must never be
bundled. Our own scope wording replaces them (see ``us_pack/config.py``), and users
who hold a licence import the official tables themselves.

Two heads, because the two leaks look nothing alike.

Head 1 catches a code paired with its official title, the shape a reproduced table
takes. Half those titles are ordinary trade words, so a bare match proves nothing:
"03" next to "Concrete" is also how any bill of quantities reads. Two discriminators
separate a copied table from ordinary vocabulary. Correspondence: the number must be
the official number for that exact title, so "07 - Concrete" is a coincidence and is
ignored. Distinctiveness: a multi-word title is language nobody reaches for by
accident and fails on sight, while single-word titles only fail once one file carries
enough distinct divisions to be the compilation rather than a coincidence. Measured
against the tree, a crosswalk to another country's standard peaks at four distinct
divisions while a real reproduced table carries twenty-four or more, so the threshold
between them is wide.

Head 2 catches the standard's name where a user reads it as a description of our own
content. That is a trademark question rather than a copyright one, it appears where no
code sits nearby, and head 1 cannot see it at all. One discriminator does most of the
work: an all-lowercase occurrence is the technical key we exchange over the API and
persist in ``classification_standard``, and it stays untouched, while the capitalised
display form is the brand. Naming the standard is legitimate in a picker, a preset or
a validation rule, so those places are allowlisted by location rather than globally.

Brand-safe by design, like ``check_no_brand_tokens.py``: only SHA-256 of the
normalised titles and brand tokens is stored, never the literal strings, so this gate
does not itself become the bundled copy it exists to prevent. Findings print the
division number and the location, never the matched title.

Exit codes:
    0  no proprietary classification content found
    1  at least one finding (with file:line locations)

Usage::

    python scripts/check_no_proprietary_classification.py                # full tracked tree
    python scripts/check_no_proprietary_classification.py path/a path/b  # given files (pre-commit)

Put ``denylist-ok`` in a trailing comment to allow a deliberate one-off; for a place
that will keep naming the standard, add it to ``_ALLOWED_NOMINATIVE`` instead, which
needs no edit to the file itself.
