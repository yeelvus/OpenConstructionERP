"""Permission guard: a route may not ask for a permission nobody registers.

``RequirePermission.__call__`` checks the key against the caller's own
permission list, then falls back to ``permission_registry.role_has_permission``.
That returns **False** for a key nothing registered, logging "Unknown permission
checked". Admin short-circuits above both checks.

So a route asking for an unregistered key is **admin-only in production**, and
no test notices, because the fixtures authenticate as an admin. The failure
needs a non-admin user to appear at all, which is why this has to be a static
check rather than a test.

The second cost is quieter and does not need a non-admin user. The admin
permission matrix calls ``permission_registry.set_min_role(key, role)``, which
raises on a key it has never seen, so a route gated this way can never be
delegated to a lower role no matter what the matrix says.

Measured 2026-08-05 across 184 module directories and 171 router files: 715
distinct keys requested against 760 registered, and exactly one key was
missing, the bare literal ``"admin"``, asked for by three routes
(``core/module_router.py`` twice and ``i18n_foundation/router.py`` once) while
``system.modules.enable`` and ``system.modules.disable`` sat registered and
unused beside them. Whoever wrote those three probably wanted ``RequireRole``,
which is a different class with a similar name that checks the role hierarchy
directly and never touches the registry. This file starts clean, so any failure
it reports is new.

What it reads:

  - Requested: every literal argument to ``RequirePermission(...)`` and
    ``RequirePermissionOrApiKey(...)``, and every literal ``read_permission=``
    / ``write_permission=`` handed to the ``create_vector_routes`` factory.
  - Registered: every literal key inside a
    ``permission_registry.register_module_permissions(...)`` call, plus the
    core ``register_core_permissions`` block.

Docstrings are stripped before scanning. Several ``permissions.py`` files quote
a ``RequirePermission("module.thing")``-shaped example in their own docstring to
explain why the file exists, and counting prose as a call site would report four
modules that are in fact correct.

Deliberately not covered: keys built at run time, and the ad-hoc in-handler
``role_has_permission`` calls in a handful of modules. Both are reachable only
by reading the value, not the source, so a clean run here says nothing about
them.

One known imprecision, in the safe direction. The registered set is read from
every ``"key": Role.X`` pair in a file that registers, rather than by resolving
the constant a registrar was handed. A file that both registers something and
holds a second, unregistered dict of keys mapped to roles would have that
second dict counted as registered, so this check can miss a gap of that exact
shape. The alternative, reading only the call's own brackets, misreports
eleven modules that pass a constant, and 84 false failures would make the gate
worthless. Erring toward a missed gap rather than toward an outage is the right
side to err on for a rule that blocks a merge.
