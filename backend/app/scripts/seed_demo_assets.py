# DDC-CWICR-OE: DataDrivenConstruction · OpenConstructionERP
"""Attach the full visible CAD/BIM file set (RVT + IFC + DWG + PDF) to demos.

The flagship installer (:mod:`app.scripts.seed_flagship`) is the only working
ORM byte-attachment path; it restores a single reference project from committed
assets. This module *generalizes* that logic so every marketplace demo project
(residential, commercial, hospital, …) ships the same complete asset set the
flagship shows, instead of empty BIM / DWG / Documents screens.

Every demo project receives, consistently:

    * a Revit (RVT) 3D BIM model with real elements and ``.dae`` geometry,
    * an IFC 3D BIM model with real elements and ``.dae`` geometry,
    * a DWG drawing in the dedicated DWG Takeoff module (2D, metadata-only -
      a DWG carries no 3D mesh, so it never enters the BIM 3D hub),
    * real downloadable PDFs (a plan set + a spec) and native CAD source
      documents on the Documents screen (IFC always, via a committed in-repo
      fixture; RVT and DWG when the optional samples folder is present).

No CAD conversion ever runs here. We reuse the already-baked, committed assets:

    app/scripts/flagship_assets/flagship.json        spec (built by _bake_flagship.py)
    app/scripts/flagship_assets/geometry_ifc.dae.gz  real DDC IFC geometry
    app/scripts/flagship_assets/geometry_rvt.dae.gz  real DDC Revit geometry
    app/scripts/flagship_assets/house_plans.pdf      reference plan set
    app/scripts/flagship_assets/housing_standards.pdf  reference spec
    frontend/e2e/fixtures/dashboards/sample-project.ifc  committed native IFC

The :data:`_BIM_MODELS` / :data:`_DWG_MODEL` sets are attached to every project.
A *bundle* (:data:`BUNDLES`) only chooses which model is *primary* (the one a
handful of BOQ positions are linked to) and which plan-set PDF labels to use.
The public entry point :func:`attach_demo_assets` is fully idempotent
(deterministic ``uuid5`` ids per project) and dialect-agnostic (pure ORM), and
every step is wrapped so a missing asset never aborts a demo install.

# Maps each known demo_id to a bundle. Residential / housing / condo demos get

# schools, mixed-use, structures, data centres, offices, …) gets the richer RVT
# coordinated bundle. ``flagship-house`` is intentionally absent - it owns its
# dedicated seed path (seed_flagship) and must not be double-seeded.
#
# Every demo_id that resolves to a DemoTemplate must appear here. A project
# absent from this map is never even offered to ``attach_demo_assets``, so it
# gets no BIMModel row, and a missing model silently empties everything that
# hangs off one: the BCF issue register skips a project with no model, and the
# coordination federation has nothing to group. That failure mode is invisible
# - both seeders log the skip at debug level - so the map is guarded by
# ``tests/unit/test_every_demo_project_is_offered_a_bim_model.py`` rather than
# by anyone noticing an empty screen.

    The drawing is seeded as an already-converted DXF (status ``ready`` with

    sees a working viewer immediately - no DDC converter needed and no

    (a base dependency). When ezdxf is somehow unavailable the helper falls

    ``needs_conversion`` (a clear convert CTA, still never a spinner).

    Idempotent on a deterministic id. Returns True when a drawing exists

    2D drawing at all. Nothing is copied off it: the seeded DXF is authored
