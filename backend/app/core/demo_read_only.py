"""Read-only mode for the public hosted demo.

Off by default. A deployment turns it on with ``OE_DEMO_READ_ONLY=true``
(``demo_read_only`` on :class:`app.config.Settings`), which is the only thing
that arms anything in this module: a self-hosted install never takes any of
these branches.

Why it is two layers and not one
--------------------------------
The obvious guard - refuse every non-GET request - makes the demo look broken,
because a large part of the API posts a body for a read: sign in, semantic
search, a validation report, a what-if simulation, a preview of an uploaded
file. The obvious repair - allowlist the non-writing routes - does not scale
here. The application mounts 2178 distinct non-GET handlers, and the
request-scoped session commits on the way out (``app.dependencies.get_session``,
``app.database.get_session``), so a handler that merely assigns an attribute on
a loaded row is a writer with no call to find. Nothing static can enumerate the
non-writing set reliably, and a list that has to be complete to be safe would
be wrong the week after it was written.

So the refusal is default-deny with a small allowlist, and it is backed by a
second guard at the database:

*Layer 1* - :func:`demo_read_only_guard`, mounted as an application-level
dependency in :mod:`app.main`. It runs after routing and before the handler, so
it keys the allowlist on the *endpoint function* rather than on a URL, and one
entry therefore covers every path a router is mounted at (the loader mirrors
each module at both a hyphenated and an underscored prefix, and several modules
carry a second alias mount on top of that). It refuses before the handler is
entered, so nothing has been written when the refusal is emitted.

*Layer 2* - :func:`_before_cursor_execute`, a listener on SQLAlchemy's ``Engine``
class. It raises on any row-moving statement issued while a request is in scope
and not permitted to write, before the statement reaches the database. This is
what makes the claim "the demo is read-only" rather than "these endpoints answer
403": it holds for every handler, including any that layer 1 lets through.

The two layers together mean an allowlist mistake is cheap in the direction that
matters. Allowlisting a route that turns out to write does not leak a write -
layer 2 refuses it with the same 403. Failing to allowlist a route that reads
costs the visitor a refusal dialog. Only the second one is a UX bug, and it is
fixed by adding one line here.

One exception to that, and it is the reason to read a candidate before adding
it rather than trusting layer 2 to catch the mistake. Layer 2 sees what goes
through SQLAlchemy, which is every write in the application but one:
``_pg_bulk_insert_cost_rows`` in ``app.modules.costs.router`` takes a raw DBAPI
cursor and ``COPY``s into it, which never reaches the listener. Two routes lead
there - ``load_cwicr_database`` and the partner-pack installer under
``/api/demo`` - and for those two, layer 1 is the only guard. It holds because
neither is allowlisted, and it stops holding the moment one of them is. So a
route that reaches that helper has to be refused by layer 1 on purpose, not
allowlisted on the assumption that layer 2 is underneath.

The refusal contract
--------------------
HTTP 403 with::

    {"detail": {"error": "demo_read_only", "message": "<plain English>"}}

``error`` is what the screen matches on; ``message`` is the fallback for
anything that is not our screen. Nothing here is localised - the client owns
the translated copy.

#:
#: ``oe_users_session`` - every pair of tokens is minted together with the row

#: and refreshing UPDATEs it. Both are needed: a login that cannot write its
#: row does not fall back to a session nobody can revoke, it raises, which is
#: the right trade and is why leaving this table out refused sign-in outright
#: rather than degrading it. DELETE is not here - pruning expired rows is a
