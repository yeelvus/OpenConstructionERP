"""A derived deadline's title cannot be edited into something nobody reads.

``title_key`` is not stored. It is worked out from ``source``: a row this
module derived is named by its ``kind``, which is an enum and translates, and
a row somebody typed is named by their own words, which do not. That line only
ever held because this module wrote the titles of the rows it derives, and
nothing was keeping it true afterwards.

``PATCH /obligations/{id}`` was the door left open. It set whatever fields it
was given, so somebody's words could land on a ``programme_rule`` row. The row
kept that source, so it kept the key, so the next caller rendered the key and
put "Final proof of use" back over what they had written. The words were not
overridden on screen once - they were never read at all, on any client, in any
language, because a caller is told to render the key and ignore the prose.

Three ways out were weighed and the refusal is the one that holds:

* Promoting the row to a typed source would make the key stop firing, but
  ``source`` is not only the title's discriminator. ``delete_derived`` reads
  it to decide which rows this module may regenerate, the obligation table
  shows it to the reader as where the deadline came from, and the funding
  insights report pivots on it. Renaming a deadline would then quietly take
  it out of the programme's control, leave a second copy behind the next time
  an award was re-recorded, and move a row between buckets in somebody's
  report. A presentation fix would have rewritten provenance.
* Clearing the key on the row would need somewhere to remember it was
  cleared, and the key is derived precisely so that no second copy of it can
  drift. There is no such field, and the one stored key on this table exists
  only because one kind tells two different sentences.

So the words the server wrote stay the server's, and everything else on the
row stays editable. The tests below hold both directions: a typed row takes
the change and keeps its author's words, and a derived row refuses it and
still answers with its kind key.
