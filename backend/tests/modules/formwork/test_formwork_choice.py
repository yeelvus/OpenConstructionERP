"""Choosing a formwork system, and getting the chosen one into the bill.

Two endpoints are covered here, and they are the two the module was missing:

* ``POST /systems/compare`` - price one contact area in every candidate system
  on ONE set of assumptions, so "which system" is a comparison rather than a
  list of names. The claims worth testing are that the assumption is held
  constant across candidates, that a system which cannot survive the assumed
  reuse count is flagged rather than silently recommended, and that the
  arithmetic is the same ``compute_cost`` the stored assignment uses.
* ``POST /assignments/{id}/push-to-boq`` - the exit to the priced bill. The
  claim worth testing is idempotency: pushing twice must re-price one position,
  not bill the same formwork twice.

These need real rows, so they run against the database like the rest of the
API suite rather than as pure math.
