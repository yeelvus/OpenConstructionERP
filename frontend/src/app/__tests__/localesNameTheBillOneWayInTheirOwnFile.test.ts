/**
 * The sibling gate, localesNameTheBillTheWayTheTradeDoes, holds six locales to
 * a name chosen for them: German writes LV, French DQE, Italian computo
 * metrico. That gate cannot grow past those six without someone deciding what
 * the rest should say, and deciding that is inventing terminology rather than
 * restoring it.
 *
 * This gate asks a question that needs no such decision. Every locale already
 * answers "what is this object called" in its own file: the label the module
 * catalogue puts in the navigation. So the question is not whether the locale
 * uses the right name, it is whether the locale uses the SAME name twice. A
 * file that calls the object one thing in the navigation and a second, equally
 * plausible thing two screens later has the disease the sibling gate was
 * written for, and it has it in a language nobody here can adjudicate.
 *
 * It is a floor, not a standard. The twenty divergences that predate it,
 * across seventeen locales and three keys, are recorded below with the locale
 * named, and the baseline may only shrink. Both directions are checked, in
 * two separate tests per key so that the failure says which way it went: a new
 * divergence is the gate proper, and a baselined locale that has been fixed is
 * a list gone stale, which is red because the answer is to delete the line and
 * not to undo the translation. Recording a locale here does not say its catalogue label is
 * the right name. In several it is the other way round - Czech výkaz výměr and
 * Dutch hoeveelhedenstaat are the settled trade terms while the catalogue
 * label reads closer to "budget" - and which of the two moves is a question
 * for a native speaker, not for a test.
 *
 * The seventeen on validation.subtitle at the time this gate landed were
 * arrived at twice, by two methods sharing no code: a stem and inflection
 * reading of each pair, which accepts Turkish keşif özetini for keşif özeti,
 * and the normalised substring containment this file implements. Both named
 * the same seventeen locales, so doubting the list meant doubting two
 * instruments rather than one. Urdu was one of the seventeen and is no longer
 * baselined below: its divergence was not a second name, it was a hole.
 * `.i18n-work/ur/_glossary.md` records "Bill of Quantities" as translated to
 * مقدار کا بل (BOQ) everywhere, the catalogue label already carries that
 * string, and validation.subtitle alone had left the English in place. There
 * was no second term to adjudicate, so this one moved without a native
 * speaker, unlike the sixteen still recorded below.
 *
 * What the containment rule cannot see: where the catalogue label is a generic
 * word for money on a page - Raming, Rozpočet, Kosztorys, Presupuesto - any
 * occurrence of that word anywhere in the value satisfies the check, including
 * in a sentence that also names the bill something else. Those are exactly the
 * locales whose label is most likely to be the wrong half of the pair. This
 * gate locks the floor where it found it; it does not prove that the locales
 * outside the baseline name the object once. Filipino is the clearest case:
 * it passes because its catalogue label and its subtitle both read the English
 * phrase verbatim, which is internal consistency and not a translation.
