"""A development owned by an EDITOR can be deleted by nobody.

Two independent walls guard DELETE /developments/{dev_id}, and no role
satisfies both at once when the owning project belongs to an editor:

  * ``RequirePermission("property_dev.delete")`` maps to MANAGER, so the
    editor who owns the project is refused with 403.
  * ``_verify_owner_via_development`` is strict, only ``project.owner_id``
    passes, so the manager and the admin who do hold the permission are
    refused with 404.

The row is therefore permanent. Its owner can still read it and cannot
remove it, and nobody with the verb can reach it.

Why the existing suite cannot see this. Every delete test in this package
is a DENIAL test: test_r8_member_denied_delete_plot asserts the status is
"in (403, 404)", which is satisfied just as well by a world where the
operation is impossible for everyone. Asserting that a request is refused
can never detect that every request is refused. This test asserts the
positive half, that exactly one role gets through, which is the half
nobody wrote.

The three roles are all asserted on purpose. A test that only checked the
owner would pass against a "fix" that simply let the global admin bypass
ownership, and that direction is barred: strict ownership here is
deliberate and closes the cross-tenant broker IDOR (deferred #66). The
manager and admin cells are the control that keeps the repair honest, so
this file fails both when nobody can delete and when the wrong party can.
