"""PG: the single-row "latest" readers lead with ``seq``, not with ``recorded_at``.

Progress entries are append-only: a mistake is corrected by recording a NEW
entry, so the reading that counts is the one appended LAST. ``seq`` is what
makes that well defined - see :func:`app.modules.progress.repository._latest_first`
and migration ``v3258_progress_entry_seq``.

Three readers were ordering by ``recorded_at DESC`` alone and never went
through ``_latest_first()``, so they answered a different question from the
rest of the module:

* ``get_latest_for_position`` - the contracts progress-claim bridge reads the
  percent it bills from this row (``contracts/service.py``);
* ``get_latest_project_entry`` - the headline "overall % complete" on the
  client-facing progress report (``reporting/service.py``);
* ``get_entries_for_period`` - the same report takes element 0 of this list as
  the reporting window's percentage.

``recorded_at`` is not a total order. It defaults to the DB's ``now()``, which
in PostgreSQL is the TRANSACTION timestamp, so every row one transaction
writes shares it exactly; and it is back-datable, which is the case pinned
here. A correction appended after the reading it corrects, carrying an earlier
``recorded_at``, used to lose to the row it was meant to replace.

Real PostgreSQL because ``seq`` is a sequence-backed server default: on a
dialect without it the column these tests are about does not populate.

Gated by ``OE_TEST_DB=pg`` (see conftest).
