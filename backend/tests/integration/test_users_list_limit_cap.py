"""Regression: GET /v1/users/ limit cap contract.

Source defect (user error log openconstructionerp-log-2026-05-22.json,
v4.3.2): the /admin/audit-log page (and other resolvers) defaulted to
``limit=200`` against this endpoint, but the backend caps it at 100 -
every audit-log mount fired a 422. The frontend default is now 100.

The cap itself moved on 2026-06-05 (``36f3ebcb8``): directory and assignee
pickers load the whole active-user list in one call, and a hard 100 dropped
assignees silently, so ``app/modules/users/router.py`` now declares
``le=500`` with that reasoning next to it. This module still locks both ends
of the contract, it just locks them at the cap the endpoint actually ships:

* limit=100 -> 200 OK (the frontend default).
* limit=500 -> 200 OK (the cap itself).
* limit=501 -> 422 (one past it; the cap cannot move without both numbers moving).

Uses the lightweight test pattern (mount just the users router on a
minimal FastAPI app with auth/perm/session dependencies stubbed) to
avoid the full ``create_app()`` boot path - see comment in
``test_crm_opportunities_limit.py`` for the rationale.
