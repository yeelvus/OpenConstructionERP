"""An upgrade lands on a database that already holds rows, and nothing tested that.

Every other test of the schema-building path starts from an empty database. That
is the one shape the upgrade path never has: an existing install boots with the
user's projects already in it, and the release's new columns arrive on tables
that are not empty. A revision that would fail on rows - a NOT NULL column with
no default, a unique constraint over values that already collide - passes on
every empty fixture and fails on the only database that matters.

What actually runs on an upgrade is not the migration chain. ``app/main.py``
never calls ``alembic upgrade``: it runs ``postgres_auto_migrate`` and then
``Base.metadata.create_all``. So the thing to test is the heal, against rows.

This reconstructs the shape a 14.8.1 database has when 15.0.x first boots on it:
the two columns v3297 adds to ``oe_boq_markup`` are removed, together with their
indexes and foreign keys, while a markup row stays in the table. Then the heal
runs, and the row has to come out the other side with its money unchanged and
the schema complete.

``oe_boq_markup`` is the table to prove it on. It carries the numbers a stored
estimate is priced with, so a column that fails to land here is not a missing
feature, it is a bill that answers differently than it did yesterday.

Self-restoring by construction: the heal is what puts the schema back, so the
cluster this shares with the rest of the lane ends the test healthy.
