"""The company name in a header band or a footer is drawn in a face that can
draw it, and fits the room it is given.

The name printed there is the firm's own. It reaches these lines through the
company profile, whose legal name may be 120 characters long and in any script,
while the bands were written for a workspace name of 60 Latin ones. Two
failures followed and both are asserted here on the rendered page:

  * The shared footer and the header band picked their face by name rather than
    by text, so a Chinese or Korean legal name came out as a row of empty
    boxes. The instrument is the glyph id: a character drawn as glyph zero is
    the box, and ``page.get_texttrace()`` reports it, which the extracted text
    does not - the string comes back intact from a document that prints nothing
    but boxes.
  * A long name ran into the page number and off the right edge of the sheet.

The population is every document that prints a running footer, plus the
settings samples, and it is asserted in both directions: a document listed as
having no page number, or no name in its footer, is checked for the absence, so
a renderer that grows one silently is a failure rather than a quiet exemption.

:mod:`tests.unit.test_generated_documents_render_chinese` asks the same
question of the document's body, which reaches the page as a paragraph. This
file is about the furniture, which does not.
