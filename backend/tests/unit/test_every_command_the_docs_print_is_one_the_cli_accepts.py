"""Every command line our documentation prints must be one the CLI accepts.

A command line in a document is a claim: this program exists, it takes these
arguments, and typing it does what the surrounding paragraph says. Nothing
checked that claim, and it went wrong in the worst possible place.
``docs/INSTALL_LINUX.md`` answered the single most common first-run failure,
a busy port, with ``openconstructionerp --port 9090``. ``--port`` is declared
on the ``serve`` and ``doctor`` subparsers and nowhere else, so the top-level
parser answers ``exit 2`` and the one page a stuck reader reaches told them to
type something that cannot work. The same section offered
``OE_PORT=9090 openconstructionerp`` as a fallback; no code under
``backend/app`` reads ``OE_PORT`` at all, so that one starts on 8080 again and
says nothing.

The gate is built out of the real parser rather than a list of known flags.
``_build_parser`` is the same function ``main`` calls, and ``app.cli`` imports
only the standard library at module scope, so this costs nothing and cannot
drift from what ships.

Three details are load-bearing.

*Abbreviation.* ``allow_abbrev`` is on by default, so ``parse_args`` accepts
``--data DIR`` for ``--data-dir`` and a documented flag that no longer exists
under that spelling could pass on a prefix of a different one. Every long
option is therefore also required to appear verbatim in the ``option_strings``
of the parser the command line actually addresses.

*Population.* Every tracked Markdown file plus the published docs page, minus
two exclusions that are named here and printed by the test rather than
filtered away in silence. A gate whose population quietly shrinks reports
green for the wrong reason, so the count and the file list are printed beside
the verdict and a floor assertion names the pages a stuck user actually
reaches.

*Synopses.* ``backend/README.md`` documents ``serve [--host HOST] [--port
PORT] ...``. Fed to ``parse_args`` verbatim those reject on the brackets, and
skipping them would leave the one place in the docs whose entire purpose is
to list the flags unchecked. They are expanded instead, and each bracketed
option is checked against the real parser.

What this does NOT cover, so that nobody reads a green here as more than it
is: the runtime strings the CLI prints are f-strings carrying formatting
placeholders and decorative separators, and an extractor over them produces
false verdicts in both directions. The two hints that were wrong are covered
instead by executing the checks that print them, at the bottom of this file.
