// Case: "Produce an NRM 1 order of cost estimate" (GB).
//
// The first estimate on a British project is produced under NRM 1 long before
// there is anything to measure, so the case runs the floor area method, holds
// the risk allowances as their own money, rebases for the date the work is
// actually built, and finishes on the basis of estimate. Content strings are
// key plus inline English default and live only here.

    "NRM 1 is the RICS rule set for order of cost estimating and elemental cost planning, and the first number a client hears is almost always produced under it. At RIBA Stage 2 the only two things anybody knows well are the gross internal floor area and the kind of building, so the estimate is a rate per square metre with an elemental breakdown under it, plus the allowances that make it a project cost rather than a construction cost wearing a project's name. This case runs that sequence and ends on the basis of estimate, because an order of cost estimate with no assumptions written beside it is a number somebody will quote back at you in a year.",
