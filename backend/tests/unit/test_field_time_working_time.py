# DDC-CWICR-OE: DataDrivenConstruction - OpenConstructionERP
"""The statutory working-time record: deadlines, retention, and derived durations.

Every test here runs on the pure engine plus the service's own line builder, so
none of it needs a database and none of it can be skipped for the want of one.

The point most of these defend is the one that makes the record worth keeping:
a line that carries clock times has exactly one duration, and it is the one
those times produce. The other half is that none of this reaches anybody who did
not ask for it - a record with no regime is the record this module has always
written.
