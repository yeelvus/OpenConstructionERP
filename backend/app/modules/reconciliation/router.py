"""Event-reconciliation API routes (auto-mounted at /api/v1/reconciliation).

Assembles the reconciled cross-channel thread for one event and persists a
reviewer's confirm / reject decisions on the engine's suggested links. Every
route is project-scoped: the caller must hold the module capability (read or
write) and pass :func:`verify_project_access` for the project, which 404s on
both "missing" and "denied" so it never leaks project existence. A decision
endpoint takes the project id in its path for the same reason - a link can only
be confirmed or rejected within a project the caller may reach.
