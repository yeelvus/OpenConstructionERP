"""Submittal ↔ approval-routes wiring (feature 06).

When the generic approval engine reaches a terminal decision on a
``submittal`` target it fires ``approval_routes.instance.completed`` (the
chain was fully approved) or ``approval_routes.instance.rejected`` (an
approver rejected a step). These subscribers translate that routed
decision back into the submittal's own FSM so a multi-step sign-off
drives the submittal status instead of a human clicking the legacy
``/approve`` button.

Design notes:

* The subscribers open their own short-lived session via
  :func:`async_session_factory` and gate on PostgreSQL, exactly like the
  wave-5 cross-module subscribers - a cross-session write on SQLite's
  single writer would deadlock the request transaction, and the engine
  publishes detached so the request session is already free.
* They only ever drive transitions the existing submittal FSM permits,
  through the idempotent :meth:`SubmittalService.apply_approval_decision`,
  so a duplicate or out-of-order event can never corrupt state.
* They are fail-soft: any error is logged at debug and swallowed so a
  downstream hiccup never breaks the foreground decision that produced
  the event.
* Projects with **no** configured route never reach here at all - the
  submittal keeps today's direct ``/approve`` / ``/review`` behaviour
  with zero breakage.
