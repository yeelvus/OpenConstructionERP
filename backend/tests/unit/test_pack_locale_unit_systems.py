"""A pack locale may translate a unit label. It may not re-measure it.

A pack ships locale overrides that the host merges over the core strings, so a
pack can give any key a new label. Relabelling is exactly what a locale is for
when the two names mean the same thing: ``units.sqft`` reading "sq ft" instead
of "Square foot" is an abbreviation, and the Hindi ``units.kg`` is a
translation.

Relabelling across measurement systems is a different act. The quantity on the
row does not move when the label does, so ``modules.boq.unit.m3`` rendered as
"cu yd" states a volume that is wrong by a factor of 1.308, and ``.kg`` shown
as "lb" is wrong by 2.205. A user reading a priced bill has no way to see it:
every number looks right for the unit printed beside it. Imperial output is a
real feature, and it needs the conversion, not the label.

So the rule is a correspondence, not a vocabulary: the measurement system of
the unit the KEY names must be the system of the unit the VALUE names. Keying
off the value alone would be wrong in both directions - ``units.ton_us``
reading "ton" is honest, while ``modules.boq.unit.t`` reading "ton" is the
1.102 error - and keying off the key alone says nothing at all.

Anything the two classifiers cannot place is passed, deliberately. A composite
trade unit (``m3_concrete``), a locale-native token (``lfm``, ``Stk``) and a
value written in a non-Latin script all fall through, because a gate that
guesses at those would fire on the packs that are already honest and be turned
off. Pure stdlib and JSON on disk, so this runs without a database.
