"""A property document writes an amount with the digits its currency has.

Every contract, receipt and certificate the property module issues goes through
one renderer, ``document_templates._format_money``. It took a locale and no
currency at all, and quantised to a ``Decimal("0.01")`` literal, so a forint
contract was issued carrying fillér that left circulation in 1999 and a Kuwaiti
dinar receipt was issued a fils short of what the payment actually settled.
Both are wrong in a document a buyer signs and a regulator reads, and neither
raises anything.

Two things are measured, because either alone would pass against code that is
still broken.

The rendered strings are pinned by equality and not by containment. A
containment assertion is exactly the shape this defect survives: ``"1,234" in
out`` is satisfied by ``"1,234.00"``, which is the output being fixed. The
table spans a zero-decimal currency, a two-decimal one and a three-decimal one
for the same reason - a table of two-decimal currencies would be green against
a renderer that had never heard of a currency at all, since two is what it
already assumed.

Then the documents themselves. The helper reading the registry proves nothing
about the ten places that call it, and a call site that still passes no
currency is a ``TypeError`` only because the argument was made required; had it
been given a default, every one of them would have kept printing cents while
this file stayed green. So each generator that prints money renders a real PDF
in forint and the extracted text is asked for the whole amount.
