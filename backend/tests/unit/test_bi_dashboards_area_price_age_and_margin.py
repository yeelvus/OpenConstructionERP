"""Three columns that exist in the schema become readable by a custom KPI.

Gross floor area, the age of a catalogue price, and the markup rate an
estimate carries. None of the three needs a schema change; each was one
catalogue entry away from being useful, and each entry had to be put in the
right place rather than the nearest one.

Where each of them goes, and why it is not the obvious place
-----------------------------------------------------------
``gross_floor_area`` belongs to a project. The tempting shortcut is to borrow it
onto ``boq`` or ``boq_position``, where the money already lives, so that cost and
area sit in one entity. That produces a number that is wrong in the direction
nobody checks: a project with four estimates reports four buildings' worth of
floor area, and a sum over its lines reports one building per line. So area is
offered on a ``project`` entity, which has one row per building, and deliberately
nowhere else.

``price_as_of`` belongs to the cost catalogue, which has no project. The ledger
that records a rate being applied to a project's work does have one, and it is
written on the ordinary position-create path. So the entity is the join of the
two, and it is offered as an AGE in days rather than as a date, because a
threshold saved in a KPI definition has to keep meaning what it said: "older
than 90 days" stays true next quarter and "before 2026-06-01" does not.

The markup rows are offered; the markup MONEY is not. What a markup line adds to
a total depends on the compounding order, on whether it applies to the direct
cost or cumulatively, and on whether a section-scoped line overrides a bill-wide
one. That cascade lives in the BOQ service and this module is not going to keep a
second copy of it in SQL. So a KPI can answer what margin an estimate carries and
how many estimates carry none; separating markup money from direct cost is the
part left out, and it is left out on purpose.
