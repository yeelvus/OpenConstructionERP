"""Resolve a production-norm material to the cost item that prices it.

A norm's material coefficient carries a NAME, not an id, so building a priced
assembly has to find the cost item behind that name. Two tiers, tried strictly
in this order:

1. **Exact normalized name** against the cost-item spine. The material name and
   each candidate's description are reduced to a comparison key by
   :func:`normalize_material_name` (accents folded, case folded, punctuation and
   whitespace dropped, a decimal separator between digits kept as a mark), and
   only an exact key equality counts. This is a
   deterministic identity match, not a guess: confidence is 1.0 and the priced
   line needs no review.
2. **Fuzzy lexical match** over the catalogue, via the shared
   :func:`app.modules.costs.matcher.match_cwicr_items`. This is a heuristic
   proposal: it prices the line but is reported with its score and flagged for
   human review.

Neither tier is offered a material whose name reduces to an empty comparison
key. The exact tier would refuse it anyway, but the lexical one scores a
punctuation-only placeholder as a full match against any description carrying
the same punctuation, so the score floor never sees a low number to reject.

The ordering is the fix, not a stricter fuzzy threshold. A threshold change only
moves which wrong answers appear; putting an exact identity match ahead of a
lexical one removes the class of "a different product priced this line while the
right one sat in the same table".

Why the exact tier does not reuse the lexical matcher's candidate window: that
window is an ``OR``-ILIKE over the query tokens capped at 400 rows with no
ordering, so on a large catalogue the correct row can simply be absent from it.
The exact tier runs its own, far more selective queries and falls back to a
bounded window only when the selective passes find nothing.

No module state, no I/O beyond the session it is handed, so the normalizer and
the tie-break are unit-testable on their own.

# a row is worthless if no candidate pass ever loads it. The JSON column is
# matched as one blob rather than key by key: a pass only has to WIDEN the set
# of rows looked at, and the key comparison in Python still decides every match,
# so a stray hit on a JSON key name or another language's value costs a row in
# the window and nothing else. The column is NOT NULL, so no coalesce is needed.
#
# One limit, because the blob is JSON and nothing overrides the engine's
# serializer: ``json.dumps`` escapes every non-ASCII character, so an accented
# localized name is stored with that letter replaced by a backslash-u escape
# and no ILIKE spelling of the word - accented or not - finds it in the blob.
# Such a row is still reachable through any fully-ASCII sibling token of the
# same name, which is the same accent-insensitivity gap the last-resort window
# below already exists for. So the capability holds outright for ASCII
# localized names and degrades to that window, never to a wrong answer.

    """Reduce a material name to its comparison key.

    Two names that denote the same product but were typed by different people
    (or exported by different systems) differ in case, accents, punctuation and
    spacing far more often than in words. The key folds exactly those away:
    Unicode NFKD decomposition drops combining marks (``Lámina`` -> ``lamina``),
    the result is case-folded, and every character that is not a letter or a
    digit is removed - so ``"12 mm"`` and ``"12mm"`` collapse to the same key
    while ``"12 mm"`` and ``"15 mm"`` stay apart.

    Two details of that fold are load-bearing, because the tier calling this an
    identity match has no second opinion to fall back on.

    A letter is any Unicode letter, not an ASCII one. Keeping only ASCII would
    reduce ``"Бетон М300"`` to ``"300"`` and ``"Кирпич 300"`` to the same
    ``"300"``, and the caller would then price concrete at the brick's rate and
    report it as an identity match needing no review. Every script the
    production norms ship in is affected the same way, so the fold keeps the
    letters and lets the names disagree.

    A decimal separator between digits is folded to a fixed mark rather than
    deleted. Deleting it is what makes ``"1,22"`` and ``"1.22"`` agree, which is
    the whole point of the key, but it also makes ``"1,2 mm"`` and ``"12 mm"``
    agree, and a 1.2 mm steel stud priced as a 12 mm board is the same silent
    wrong answer. Folding to a mark keeps the first pair equal and the second
    pair apart. The cost is that a thousands separator no longer disappears, so
    ``"1,000 kg"`` and ``"1000 kg"`` are now different keys; that direction is
    the safe one, because a missed exact match falls through to the fuzzy tier
    and arrives flagged for review rather than as a settled price.
