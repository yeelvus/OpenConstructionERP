"""A converted variation is one change, and must be counted as one.

Promoting a variation request creates two rows for one agreed change: the
variation order, and the change order that mirrors it
(``VariationsService.convert_vr_to_vo``). Both families feed the earned-value
gather and the run-rate curve, so before the mirror was recognised every
conversion added its money twice - to the cumulative curve, to the intake rate
and, once the mirror was approved, to the committed impact.

The pair is created here by the real promotion rather than by hand-built rows,
because the link the dedup reads is stamped by that call and a fixture that
stamped it itself would prove nothing about the code that ships.

Suppression is conditional on the variation order counting, so the two cases
that a blanket "drop every mirror" rule gets wrong are asserted too: a mirror
whose variation order was voided is the only surviving record of the change and
must carry it, and a change order nobody promoted is not a mirror at all.

PostgreSQL, py3.12 - needs the app plus a database, so it cannot run on the
pure-engine runner.
