"""Every `from app... import name` in the commit must resolve inside the commit.

On 2026-08-17 `app/modules/rfi/router.py` was committed, clean, importing
`count_activity_for_entity` from `app.core.audit_log` twice. The function
itself never left the working tree. Every local run passed, because every
local run reads the working tree, where the function was present. A fresh
clone could not import the RFI router at all, so the application did not
start, and the first thing to notice was a test failing on collection in CI.

Two neighbouring guards do not cover this. A check for untracked FILES that
the tree references cannot see it, because `audit_log.py` was tracked and only
the symbol inside it was absent. `check_migration_heads.py` answers the same
shape of question for the alembic graph, which is where this class was first
found (a revision naming a parent the repository did not carry), and this is
the import-graph half of it.

So: read blobs out of a git ref rather than off disk, parse them, and ask of
every intra-app `from a.b.c import name` whether this ref's own `a/b/c.py`
binds `name` at module level. Text only, no runtime import, so it needs no
database, no dependencies installed, and it cannot hang on an environment
problem the way importing the real package can.

Deliberately quiet about three shapes that cannot break a boot:

  * an import inside `try:` that is caught, which is how this tree probes for
    optional modules,
  * an import inside `if TYPE_CHECKING:`, which never executes,
  * a name reached through a star import, where the namespace is not knowable
    from the module's own text.

Relative imports are skipped; they resolve by position and a missing one is a
syntax-level error the interpreter reports on its own. Modules that do not
parse are counted and named rather than being reported as missing, because
calling an unreadable file an absent one produced 120 false findings on the
first run of this script and a checker that cries wolf stops being read.

Needs a 3.12 interpreter, the same floor the backend itself declares, because
it parses the backend's own syntax. Anything older reads healthy files as
unparsable and the check refuses rather than blaming them.
