"""A password change must end the session at every door, not just the front one.

``password_changed_at`` is the one session kill switch this product has. A
token whose ``iat`` predates it is refused, so changing a password ends a
stolen session on the next request. That is the whole mechanism, and it used
to be enforced in exactly one of the places a token is accepted.

Two doors let the killed session back in, and this test holds both shut.

The refresh endpoint was the wider one. ``UserService.refresh_tokens`` checked
the signature, the ``type`` claim and ``is_active``, and never looked at
``password_changed_at``. A refresh token minted before the change therefore
still minted a new access token, and that token's ``iat`` is the present
moment, so it sailed through the watermark that was supposed to stop it. The
kill switch was not weakened by this, it was cancelled: refresh tokens live
thirty days against the access token's hour, so whoever holds one keeps the
account for a month after the victim changes their password.

The sockets were the quieter one. Every token entry point that is not
``get_current_user_payload`` authenticates through
``verify_user_exists_and_active``, which loaded the user, checked ``is_active``
and stopped. The watermark went into the inline copy of that check inside
``get_current_user_payload`` and not into the shared helper, so a live socket
survived the password change that closed every HTTP call beside it. Passing
``issued_at`` into that helper is not itself the enforcement, which is the
trap this file exists to keep shut: the argument was accepted as required
before the body ever read it, and every caller looked correct.

Every assertion here is paired with a positive control, because both defects
look exactly like a refusal. A test that only asserts "the refresh 401s" and
"the socket closes" passes against a build where refresh is broken for
everyone and the socket never opens at all - the same green, none of the
meaning. So each door is first shown to be OPEN for the very token that is
about to be refused.

The refresh control deliberately uses a SECOND user rather than a first call
by the same one. A revocable-refresh design rotates the token on use, which
would make the second call fail as replay rather than as watermark - the
right verdict reached by the wrong mechanism, and the assertion message would
quietly become a lie. One user, one refresh, one meaning.
