"""i18n orphan guard: block t() keys that no locale file can answer.

The two existing locale guards both start from a key that exists. The escape
guard reads locale files; the leak guard compares a locale's value against
en.ts. Neither can see the case where a key is in NO locale file at all,
because there is no value to read and nothing to compare against - the leak
guard exits 0 on it, the escape guard never visits it, tsc is happy, vitest
is happy and `npm run build` is happy.

The call site still renders, because `t(key, {defaultValue})` falls back to
the defaultValue when the key resolves nowhere. So the string reaches every
language in English, and every gate we own reports green. #175 shipped
exactly this way: service.sla_breached and service.sla_late were converted
from English literals into keys, the keys were never added to any locale
file, and the SLA chip read in English in every language through a full
release with three hygiene gates passing on it.

This guard closes that hole. It reads every `t(key, {..., defaultValue, ...})`
call site under frontend/src, resolves each key against every bundle, and
fails on any key fewer than all of them can answer. The locale count is
never written down here: it is whatever LOCALE_GLOB finds, because the count
has grown four times since this was written and a number in a comment is a
claim nobody re-checks.

Four things worth knowing about how it counts:

  * Plural forms. i18next resolves a counted key through its CLDR category,
    so `meetings.attachment_n` need never exist as a bare key if
    `meetings.attachment_n_one` and `_other` do. A key is reachable in a
    locale if the bare form OR any CLDR-suffixed form is present there.
    Ignoring this reports 23 orphans where there are 8. What it deliberately
    does NOT check is plural COMPLETENESS - a Russian file carrying only
    `_other` counts as reachable here, because "reachable at all" and "has
    every form this language needs" are different questions and conflating
    them would let this guard fail for a reason its message does not state.

  * Regional variants. es-MX, es-CL, es-CO, pt-BR and en-US carry only the
    words that differ from their base language, by design, so a key they do
    not declare is answered by es, pt or en and the reader sees their own
    language rather than a fallback. Those are not holes and counting them
    as holes made one 1499-key overlay print 25280 errors. A variant is only
    missing a key when its base is missing it too.

  * Scope. Keys called WITHOUT a default are out of scope. A missing one of
    those renders the raw key on screen, which is loud, self-reporting and
    gets fixed the day someone opens the page. A default is the silent one,
    and silence is what needs a machine watching it.

    i18next takes a default in two shapes and both are silent: the options
    object this guard was written around, and a bare string as the second
    argument, `t(key, 'Some English')`. For a long time only the first was
    read, so the second was out of scope by accident rather than by the
    reasoning above - the same defect the guard exists to catch, in the shape
    it happened not to match. Measured when that was fixed: 1120 keys were
    called only in the positional shape, and 20 of them had a real gap. Eight
    were answered by no locale at all and had been English in every language
    since they were written - `people.no_login` and its neighbours in the
    project people picker, and three subtotal lines in the assembly library.
    `positionalDefaultIsADefaultValue.test.ts` asserts the runtime behaviour
    this scope now rests on, so an i18next that stopped honouring the
    positional form would fail there rather than turn this guard back into a
    formality.

  * Baseline, not allowlist. Known debt lives in i18n_orphan_baseline.json
    as an explicit map of key to the SET of locales that cannot answer it,
    the same shape the leak guard uses and for the same reason: a count
    cannot tell a repaired locale from a newly broken one, and a bare key
    list goes green the moment the first locale is filled in. The set may
    only shrink. More locales missing than recorded is a regression.

Parser desync is a failure, not a pass. The key regex here is double-quote
only, matching the shape every locale file is written in; if a file ever
picks up single-quoted or multi-line entries its keys drop out of the scan
and the guard would go green on missing data. A locale file that parses to
no keys, or a source tree that yields no call sites, fails rather than
reporting success on nothing.

A gap in a locale outside SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES is not always the same defect
as a gap in one that is. frontend/src/app/i18n.ts decides which languages a
real reader can pick, and a file that exists on disk but is not on that list
is not being shown to anyone - a translator can be partway through it, or it
can be a build nobody finished, and those are different states. A locale in
SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES gets no exception here regardless of which: it is being
offered today, so every gap in it stays a hard error, exactly as before this
mechanism existed. Outside that list, the guard reads how much of the file
still matches English word for word (identical_fraction, against
IN_PROGRESS_IDENTICAL_FRACTION) rather than trusting a flag someone could set
once and never revisit: a file still mostly English downgrades to a loud,
counted line instead of an error, and a file that reads as finished but was
never added to SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES is its own anomaly and gets said
explicitly rather than passed in silence. The threshold was set by measuring
the committed tree, not guessed: every finished locale sat under 5% identical
(nl highest, at 4.83%, from ordinary overlap like numbers and codes and
acronyms such as BOQ or MEP), en-US sat at 0% because it inherits everything,
and the one locale genuinely mid-translation at the time sat at 47.23%.
Whether a given locale belongs in SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES at all is a product
decision this guard does not make; it only enforces whichever way that list
currently reads.
