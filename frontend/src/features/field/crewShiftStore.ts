/**
 * Where an open shift lives between page loads.
 *
 * A punch-in is never queued. It cannot be: the hours are not known until the
 * shift ends, so only the punch-out becomes a mutation. That makes the open
 * shift's only record the crew roster held by the tab, and holding it in
 * memory alone meant closing the tab lost it without a word. A worker who
 * pockets their phone at the start of a shift is the ordinary case on a site,
 * not an edge one, and the loss is silent: nothing is queued, so the sync
 * badge shows nothing pending and everything looks fine.
 *
 * Keyed by project rather than by day, so a shift running past midnight is
 * still open when the phone comes back.
