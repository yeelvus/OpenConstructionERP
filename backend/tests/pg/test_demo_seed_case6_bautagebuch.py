"""The seeded German Bautagebuch must read as a document, not as filler.

The showcase register is filmed as evidence that holds up in a dispute, so
the properties gated here are the ones a Bauleiter checks first: the days
are days the site was actually open, the text is the site's own language,
"geschlossen" names who closed it and when, and the archived chain carries
a seal that still verifies after the dates were moved back to the site's
own chronology.

Against a real PostgreSQL schema, because the diary carries a unique
constraint on (project_id, diary_date) and the whole point of the seeding
order this gates is that two seeders no longer both write that column.
