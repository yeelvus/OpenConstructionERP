// Case: "Take off quantities from a PDF plan" (DE).
//
// A Kalkulator or Handwerksmeister is invited to tender and gets PDF sheets and
// nothing else: no DWG, no model. This case walks the plan into calibrated,
// named measurements and out again as BOQ positions ready for pricing, with the
// chain from the quantity back to the line on the drawing left intact - which is
// what a checkable Aufmass means in the German market. Content strings are key
// plus inline English default and live only here.
