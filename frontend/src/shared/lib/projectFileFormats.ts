/**
 * Pure matching logic behind the "Open from project files" picker.
 *
 * Every viewer/takeoff module (PDF takeoff, DWG takeoff, BIM viewer, point
 * cloud, CAD explorer) used to offer a local disk upload only, even when the
 * project's Files area already held the very drawing the user wanted. The
 * shared picker closes that gap; this module decides WHICH stored files a
 * given module may be offered.
 *
 * Two deliberate design rules, both learned from production bugs:
 *
 *  1. The filename is the PRIMARY signal, ``mime_type`` only a fallback.
 *     The CDE document model serialises the original filename as ``name``
 *     (NOT ``filename``), and ``mime_type`` is nullable and frequently wrong
 *     for CAD payloads, which servers happily label
 *     ``application/octet-stream``. So we parse the extension off ``name``
 *     and consult ``mime_type`` only when the name carries no extension at
 *     all. A file called ``plan.dwg`` is a DWG even if the server tagged it
 *     ``application/pdf``.
 *  2. A format that a module can only open AFTER DDC cad2data conversion is
 *     matched but flagged, never silently offered as instantly viewable.
 *     Callers surface the flag so the user knows a conversion step runs
 *     first. This is why the matcher returns a descriptor and not a boolean:
 *     a boolean would push the conversion rule into the component, where it
 *     could not be unit-tested.
 *
 * Nothing here imports React or the API layer, so it stays cheap to test.
 * It is not import-free, though: the human-readable label joins its formats
 * through the shared formatter so the separator follows the reader's
 * language, and that pulls in the preferences store. The matching itself is
 * still pure; only the label is localised.
