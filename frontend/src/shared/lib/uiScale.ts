/**
 * Interface size, shown in Settings as "Text size".
 *
 * How the app is sized decides how it can be scaled, and each alternative was
 * measured before this one was picked:
 *
 * - The root font-size does not move the text. The Tailwind type scale is
 *   declared in px (`text-xs` is 11px, `text-sm` 13px, `text-base` 15px), the
 *   source carries about 2,200 arbitrary `text-[Npx]` classes and ~200 inline
 *   numeric font sizes, and AG Grid reads `--ag-font-size: 13px`. The 15px on
 *   `html` only drives rem spacing, so scaling it grows the gaps and leaves the
 *   letters where they are.
 * - CSS `zoom` on `<html>` scales everything but splits the coordinate space.
 *   Measured in Chromium 153 at 125%: a fixed popover placed from its anchor's
 *   getBoundingClientRect lands 62.5px right and 40.6px low of an anchor at
 *   (200, 100), `window.innerWidth` stays at the unzoomed width so Tailwind
 *   breakpoints do not react, a canvas reports clientWidth 200 against a rect
 *   of 250, and `devicePixelRatio` stays at 1 so PDF.js and Three.js render a
 *   1x backing store that is then blown up. About 40 files read
 *   getBoundingClientRect and 29 render through portals, so this is not a
 *   corner case.
 * - Native webview zoom is what browser zoom is: the CSS viewport shrinks and
 *   `devicePixelRatio` grows, so rects, pointer coordinates, breakpoints and
 *   canvases all stay in one space. Same probe: popover error 0, innerWidth
 *   1024 on a 1280px window, devicePixelRatio 1.25.
 *
 * So the desktop app zooms its own webview through Tauri, and the web app
 * leaves it to the browser's zoom, which already is that mechanism and which
 * the browser remembers per site. A page cannot set browser zoom, and faking it
 * with CSS would ship the drift measured above.
 *
 * The chosen size is kept per device in localStorage. In the desktop app that
 * storage belongs to the loopback origin the launcher serves from, the same
 * place the theme and language live.
