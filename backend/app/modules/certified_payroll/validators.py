"""Certified payroll validation rules.

A certified payroll is a statement somebody signs and an awarding body relies
on. These rules are what reads it before the signature goes on, and they are
deliberately the questions a compliance officer asks first:

* ``certified_payroll.worker_without_classification`` - ERROR. Somebody worked
  and the payroll does not say as what. Nothing about their rate can be checked
  until it does.
* ``certified_payroll.hours_without_determination``   - ERROR. Hours are claimed
  against a classification that cites no wage determination, so no rate was ever
  established for the work.
* ``certified_payroll.rate_below_determination``      - ERROR. The package paid
  is below the package the cited determination requires.
* ``certified_payroll.overtime_base_includes_fringe`` - ERROR. The overtime
  multiplier was applied to a base larger than the basic rate, which pays the
  premium on the fringe benefit amount as well as on the wage.
* ``certified_payroll.statement_of_compliance_missing`` - ERROR. The week has no
  signature, so there is no statement of compliance and nothing was certified.
* ``certified_payroll.fringe_election_unstated``      - WARNING. Fringe money is
  recorded but the payroll does not say whether it went to a plan or was paid in
  cash, which the statement of compliance has to elect between.
* ``certified_payroll.determination_out_of_window``   - WARNING. The week worked
  falls outside the effective window of the determination it cites.

The rules take a plain dict rather than ORM instances, so they are unit-testable
without a session and run identically over a draft week derived live from
payroll entries and over a certified week read back from its frozen lines::

    {
        "week": {...},            # the CertifiedPayrollWeek as a dict
        "lines": [{...}, ...],    # one derived or frozen line per worker
    }

Registration follows the module convention:
:func:`register_certified_payroll_rules` is idempotent and is called from the
module's startup hook and from the test fixtures, because no test process runs
application startup.

Nothing here knows a rate. Every figure a rule compares against is read off the
determination the contractor put on file; the platform ships no wage schedule
and these rules would report the same findings in any jurisdiction.
