"""A row nobody has typed into is not a line of the bill.

"Add Position" in the editor creates the row on the server immediately and
opens its description cell, which is the behaviour the author built: the
create handler posts ``description=""``, ``unit="m2"``, ``quantity=0``,
``unit_rate=0`` and the grid then puts the cursor in that row. So a bill
legitimately holds rows carrying nothing yet, and the product's job is not to
stop creating them but to stop treating them as priced lines.

Two things must be true of such a row. It must not be counted - a blank line
inflates the position tally on a bill's card and in its detail. And it must
not reach an export - a delivered bill carrying a blank line is a defect its
recipient sees, and that is the half that leaves the building.

The assertions here carry a denominator on purpose. "The empty row is not
counted" is satisfied by a reader that counts nothing at all, so every bill
below holds one real priced line alongside the empty one and the expected
figure is exactly one. The export assertions name the ordinal that must be
present as well as the one that must be absent, for the same reason.
