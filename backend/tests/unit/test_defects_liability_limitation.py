"""Tests for the opt-in limitation regime on the defects-liability register.

Two things are being proved here and they pull in opposite directions.

The first is that the feature is right for the person who needs it: four years
under the VOB/B, five under the BGB, counted from Abnahme the way § 188 BGB
counts, and a recorded period that contradicts the regime it names gets reported
rather than silently corrected.

The second is that the feature does not exist for anybody else. An entry that
never named a regime must derive no date, lose no date, gain no finding and cause
no review, and it must do all of that even when its own numbers are a mess - the
case a half-careful implementation trips on, because it is tempting to derive a
date whenever the arithmetic happens to be possible. Those tests are written
against an entry that has a start date to derive from and a period that
disagrees with itself, so a regression that quietly starts deriving or reporting
is caught rather than looking like a no-op.

The service-layer derivation is driven through transient ORM instances with no
session, which is what :func:`_apply_derived_period` actually operates on, so
the whole file runs with no database.
