"""The committed-by-position rollup answers with a page, and says how big it is.

This rollup is a register keyed to the bill, not a fixed taxonomy: one row
appears for every position the project has raised an order against, so the
set grows whenever a buyer orders against a position nothing had been ordered
against before. That is why it carries an envelope rather than an exemption.

``total`` is the number the envelope exists for, and it is the one a shape
assertion cannot check: on any project small enough to fit in one page a
``total`` that merely echoes ``len(items)`` is indistinguishable from a
correct one. So every test here builds more positions than the page it asks
for, and checks the total against a number it knows independently.

The count is also not the number of rows the database returns. The collapse
from cost line to bill position happens in Python, and several cost lines can
name one position, so a total taken from the ``GROUP BY`` would be larger than
the list the caller receives. ``test_two_cost_lines_on_one_position_...``
is the case that separates those two numbers.
