 * The YAML files that the backend ships at `data/bim_rules/*.yaml` are

 * raw YAML, edit it locally, and call `install-from-yaml` only when they
 * decide to install.
 *
 * Each requirement template exists in two flavours that check the *same*
 * design intent against the two ways models arrive:
 *   - `ifc`   — selects by IFC entity class (IfcWall, IfcSpace, …) and
 *               asserts Pset-style property names (FireRating, ClearWidth).
 *   - `revit` — selects by Revit category (Walls, Rooms, …) and asserts
 *               Revit parameter names (Fire Rating, Width, DIN_276_Code),
 *               noting Type vs Instance vs Shared parameters in each rule.
 *
 * Keep these strings byte-identical to the source files in `data/bim_rules/`
 * - they are the canonical artefact. If the backend rules change, update
 * this file in the same PR so the library does not drift.

    Enforces the canonical "<DEPT>.<LEVEL>.<ROOM>" room-code pattern on the
    Revit® Rooms "Number" parameter so downstream FM exports parse cleanly.

    rationale: |
      FM systems and COBie exports depend on the room-code structure to key
      rooms across disciplines. "Number" is the built-in Rooms instance
      parameter and the natural export key. Non-conforming numbers break
      the join and force manual reconciliation.
