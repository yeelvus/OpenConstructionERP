"""Project-roster routes, mounted under ``/api/v1/teams``.

Kept in its own module and included from :mod:`app.modules.teams.router`, the
way ``resources`` mounts its depth routes. The module loader only looks for a
``router`` attribute in ``router.py``, so this file is reached through that
include and never directly.

Every path is project-scoped (``/project/{project_id}/roster/...``). That is
not decoration: it is what lets the service gate a read or a write on the
project before it touches a row, and what stops a roster id from being usable
across projects. The only exception is the static vocabulary, which describes
the platform rather than any tenant's data.

Like the rest of the module, each collection route is registered in both its
bare and its trailing-slash form because the app runs with
``redirect_slashes=False``.
