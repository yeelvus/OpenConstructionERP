# DDC-CWICR-OE: DataDrivenConstruction - OpenConstructionERP
"""An HSE investigation is only real if its project can reach it.

The seeder minted a fresh ``uuid4()`` for every investigation's ``incident_ref``
and so wrote ten rows that belong to no incident anywhere. Nothing about the
table could show it: the rows are present, well formed and non-null, and a count
over them reads exactly like a populated register. What decides is the join -
``InvestigationRepository.list_for_project`` resolves scope through
``oe_safety_incident``, so an id matching no incident is scoped to no project.
Incidents are the module's default tab, which is why the module read as empty on
arrival while six other tabs were full.

Every assertion below therefore goes through the repository's own project-scoped
read. A test that counted rows would have passed on the broken seeder.

The second failure is the guard. The seeder's own rule was that any populated
HSE Advanced table makes the whole seed a no-op, so on the databases that carry
the bug - the ones already seeded - a corrected block would never run. A
table-wide guard on the investigations table itself would fail the same way,
satisfied for good by the ten unreachable rows.
