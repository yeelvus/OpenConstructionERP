"""The seam where a partner pack switches validation rule sets on.

A pack manifest carries two lists that read alike and mean opposite things.
``validation_rule_packs`` names the reference documents the pack ships under
``rule_packs/``; the engine never executes those, and the name is asserted
elsewhere to equal the JSON file stem. ``validation_rule_sets`` names engine
rule-set identifiers, and those are the ones that make rules run.

Before this field existed there was nowhere to write the second kind of name.
Seven packs wrote the standard into the document list instead - ``din_276``
where the registry has ``din276`` - and the installer answered "no built-in
engine match", which is a true statement about the string and a false one about
the standard. It was never the whole defect though: ``validation_rule_packs``
had no runtime consumer at all, so a correctly spelled entry activated exactly
as much as a misspelled one, which is nothing. Both halves are tested here.

Every test that needs the registry measures it in a subprocess with a stated
load set. The registry is not a constant - modules register their own sets when
their ``validators`` module is imported - so an in-process reading describes
whatever the pytest session happens to have loaded rather than the software.
