 * Load a locale into i18next, together with the base language it falls back to.

 * A regional variant carries only what its region words differently and leans on

 * above. But ``fallbackLng`` only names a bundle; it does not fetch one. This
 * function used to import ``code`` and nothing else, so for the four variants
 * whose base is itself lazy the chain was configured and inert: an es-MX reader's
 * lookup walked es-MX, then an ``es`` bucket that was never loaded, then landed on
 * English. The ~2700 ``cases.*`` keys that ``es.ts`` has and ``es-MX.ts`` does not
 * rendered in English with a complete Spanish translation sitting in a chunk
 * nobody asked for. Same for es-CL, es-CO and pt-BR.
 *
 * ``en-US`` is why this went unnoticed: its base is ``en``, which ships in the main
 * bundle and is in ``loadedLocales`` from the start, so the one variant with a test
 * was also the one variant that worked.
 *
 * The base is derived from the code rather than special-cased per locale, so the
 * next regional variant added to ``SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES`` is chained by existing
 * code instead of by somebody remembering to copy a branch.
 *
 * Direction matters and is load-bearing: the two bundles go into *separate*
 * per-language buckets, and i18next consults ``es-MX`` before ``es``. So every key
 * the variant defines keeps winning, and only the keys it omits come from the base.
 * It is a fallback, never a replacement — the variants exist because Mexican,
 * Chilean, Colombian and Brazilian practice name things differently from Spain and
 * Portugal (costo not coste, cimbra not encofrado), and overwriting that deliberate
 * wording with the base language would be a regression that nothing on screen would
 * reveal.
 *
 * Both imports are awaited together rather than fired off, because
 * ``initialLocaleReady`` below is what ``main.tsx`` waits on before mounting. That
 * wait is not unbounded: ``main.tsx`` races it against ``LOCALE_MOUNT_CAP_MS``
 * (2000 ms) and mounts on whichever lands first. So awaiting the base narrows the
 * window rather than closing it — if the base chunk is still in flight when the
 * cap fires, the first frame does show English for exactly the keys this change is
 * meant to fix, and the explicit ``languageChanged`` emit below repaints it once
 * the chunk lands. A flash, not a stuck page. Firing the base off unawaited would
 * make that flash the ordinary case rather than the loaded-network one, which is
 * the whole reason for the ``Promise.all``. Each chunk keeps its own error
 * handling, so a failed base fetch costs the reader nothing they had before —
 * they still get the variant's own strings.
