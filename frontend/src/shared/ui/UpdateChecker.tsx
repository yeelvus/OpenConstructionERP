/**
 * UpdateNotification — Sidebar widget showing when a new version is available.
 *
 * Reads `GET /api/system/version-check`, our own backend, and shows a compact
 * card in the sidebar when that endpoint says an update is available. The card
 * surfaces the release highlights and a one-click jump to the release.
 *
 * Implementation notes:
 *
 * - **Where the answer comes from.** The server asks PyPI, falls back to the
 *   GitHub release, compares versions itself and caches the result for four
 *   hours. This used to be a browser call straight to api.github.com, which
 *   costs the anonymous rate limit — 60 requests an hour per IP, shared by
 *   everyone in an office — and cannot be answered at all on an air-gapped
 *   install, where it failed once an hour per tab and logged every attempt.
 *   The server also knows things the browser cannot see: which version is
 *   really installed, and whether this build can upgrade itself.
 *
 * - **Caching.** The query holds the answer for the same four hours the
 *   server caches it, so mounting the widget again costs nothing and a
 *   long-lived tab still notices a release that lands while it is open.
 *
 * - **Failure.** Anything other than a well-formed answer — offline, a proxy
 *   answering with its own page, a slow endpoint, an error — renders nothing
 *   at all. The notice can never be the reason a screen fails.
 *
 * - **Dismiss.** Per-version dismiss state is stored in sessionStorage; once
 *   the user closes the card for v0.8.0 they will not see it again until
 *   v0.8.1 (or higher) appears.

              reader that the tool telling them about the update cannot apply
              it either.

              `isTauri` widens this beyond frozen builds rather than replacing
              the test, and the two are not the same question. Whether pip can
              run is a fact about the build; whether the reader is sitting in
              the desktop shell is a fact about the window. A desktop build
              backed by a real venv answers yes to both, and it keeps the pip
              route below - what it gains here is the installer, which works
              for it either way. Nothing promises to install anything: we ship
              no updater, and on Windows the installer wants administrator
              rights that a download cannot grant itself. */}
