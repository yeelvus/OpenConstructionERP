"""The public demo is genuinely read-only, and only when it is switched on.

The claim under test is not "the guard answers 403". It is that with the flag
on, nothing a visitor can reach writes to the database, which is a different
and much stronger claim, so the evidence is a row census of every table in the
schema taken before and after the write attempts rather than the status codes
the API returned.

Stated that way on purpose, because the wider claim - that with the flag on
nothing in the database moves at all - is false on a running deployment, and a
guarantee stated too strongly is worse than a narrower one stated exactly: the
day it breaks nobody believes the test. Background housekeeping keeps running.
The known example is the collaboration-lock sweeper, which deletes expired
rows every thirty seconds outside any request, so no request-scoped guard sees
it. It is stopped for the duration of this suite, in ``app_client``, which
says why. What is guaranteed here is about the surface a visitor can reach.

Three phases, all in one run, on one application instance:

* Phase A, flag ON  - every non-safe method on every mounted route is refused
  with the exact contract, and the census is unchanged afterwards.
* Phase B, flag OFF - the same writes all succeed and the census grows. Without
  this control, phase A would also pass against a harness that never manages to
  write anything, and a guard that is on for everybody would look correct.
* Phase C, flag ON  - reads still work, including the ones that post a body,
  and a visitor can still sign in.

The flag is flipped between phases on a single app built once, which is also
the point: it proves the value is read per request rather than baked in at
construction, so nobody can later flip the default and have this suite stay
green.

def walk_routes(routes: Any, prefix: str = "", inherited: tuple = ()) -> Iterator[tuple[str, Any, tuple]]:
    """Every route the application answers on, as ``(full_path, route, inherited)``.

    ``inherited`` is the dependencies the route picks up from the routers it is
    mounted through, which on current FastAPI is where they live rather than on
    the route itself. See the note on effective dependencies at the end.

    Reading ``app.routes`` directly is wrong on current FastAPI and this is not
    a theoretical concern: it is how this file came to verify the read-only
    guarantee against five endpoints out of roughly five thousand, in the only
    lane that gates, while passing locally for a completely different reason.

    Up to 0.140, ``include_router`` copied the sub-router's routes into the
    application's own table, already carrying their full prefix, so iterating
    ``app.routes`` was the whole answer. From 0.141 an include appends ONE
    opaque ``_IncludedRouter`` wrapper that holds the router and resolves paths
    when a request arrives. Measured on 0.141.1: the wrapper has no ``methods``
    and no ``path``, so a loop that skips entries without them drops every
    router-mounted route in the product in silence, leaving only the handful
    declared directly on the app object with ``@app.post``. ``pyproject.toml``
    pins ``fastapi>=0.116,<1`` and CI installs fresh, so CI runs the second
    shape while the local virtualenvs still run the first. Both must work.

    So: recurse through ``original_router`` and accumulate ``include_context``
    prefixes; nested includes wrap again, so it has to recurse rather than
    descend one level. On the older shape neither attribute exists, the prefix
    stays empty and the route's own already-prefixed path is yielded, which is
    why one traversal serves both. Verified to return identical results on
    0.136.3 and 0.141.1 for a nested app with a mirrored include.

    Both attributes are private and have moved once already, which is the whole
    reason this comment exists. Two defences: callers cross-check the count
    against ``app.openapi()``, which is public and needs no private attribute,
    and the sweep asserts a floor. FastAPI's own ``iter_route_contexts`` was
    tried instead and rejected: on 0.141.1 it yields ``path=''`` for every
    WebSocket route, so it cannot enumerate sockets at all, and sockets are the
    half no OpenAPI cross-check can cover.

    On effective dependencies, which is the other half of the same change.
    Up to 0.140 an application-level dependency was COPIED onto every route as
    it was included, so ``route.dependencies`` was the whole answer. On 0.141 it
    is not copied: a router-mounted route reads ``route.dependencies == []`` and
    the dependency is applied from the router chain when the request arrives.
    Measured both ways on 0.141.1: the real sockets report no dependencies and
    the guard demonstrably still runs on them. So a test that asserts on
    ``route.dependencies`` alone is asserting a storage detail that has already
    changed once, and it fails on the version CI installs while the behaviour it
    cares about is fine. Callers must union the route's own dependencies with
    what is yielded here.

    What accumulates is ``include_context.dependencies``, not the included
    router's own ``dependencies``, and the difference is a real gap rather than
    a preference. A router's own dependencies are copied onto its routes when
    the route is declared, so they already arrive in ``route.dependencies``.
    The include context is where the two that are NOT copied end up: the
    application-level ones and any passed to ``include_router(dependencies=)``.
    Accumulating the router's own instead reconstructs the application level
    and re-adds what the route already had, and silently drops every
    include-level dependency. Measured on a four-level case - application,
    include of A, include of B, router B's own, plus one on the route - the
    context accumulator reproduces all five on 0.141.1, and the resulting set
    is identical to what 0.136.3 merges flat onto the route. That equality
    across versions is the property worth having; passing today is not, because
    nothing in the product currently passes ``dependencies=`` to an include and
    a check that missed them would look just as green.

    Nested includes do not double count. A wrapper's ``include_context`` holds
    only what its own include declared; FastAPI combines it with the parent's
    when resolving a request, so accumulating down the recursion here is the
    same sum reached once rather than twice.

    """Every socket the application mounts is wired to the guard.

    A wiring claim, not a behaviour one, and the split is deliberate. What a
    socket does once it is connected - a stranger refused at the handshake, the
    two real sockets still opening, an allowlisted socket still refused at the
    write - is asserted in ``test_demo_read_only_sockets.py``, against real and
    allowlisted sockets. What is left here is the half that belongs with the
    census above: that the sweep can see every socket at all, and that what it
    sees carries the guard.

    Sockets are the sharper case for the census. They carry no method, so the
    HTTP sweep in phase A skips them by construction, and they are absent from
    the OpenAPI schema, so the cross-check cannot see them either. Whatever is
    asserted about sockets has to be asserted here or nowhere.

    FastAPI fills a ``Request`` parameter only for an HTTP route, so a guard
    annotated ``Request`` is called with the argument missing on a WebSocket
    handshake and every socket in the application dies with a ``TypeError`` -
    with the flag off as much as on, because the failure is in solving the
    dependency rather than in anything the guard decides. ``HTTPConnection`` is
    the common base of both and is filled for either. That is check 1, and it
    is cheap insurance against a one-word annotation change.

    Three checks:

    1. the guard's parameter really binds as a connection rather than a request;
    2. every socket route the real application mounts really does carry the
       guard, on the EFFECTIVE dependency set rather than on what the route
       object happens to store, which is a storage detail that has already
       moved once - see :func:`walk_routes`;
    3. a real socket on the real application still serves with the flag on,
       driven rather than inferred. This one is the negative control for check
       2: a set assembled from private attributes could be complete, correct
       and still describe something that never runs, and a census that cannot
       be wrong about that is not worth having.

    The database tripwire has one documented blind spot that a socket would be
    alone with if it reached it: ``_pg_bulk_insert_cost_rows`` in
    ``app.modules.costs.router`` writes through a raw DBAPI cursor that never
    reaches the listener. Neither socket goes near it today. Worth knowing
    before adding a third.
