"""Phone number validation engine - Wave 29 of the worldwide-parameterisation audit.

Per-country dial-code and national number patterns allow the engine to:

1. Validate a raw phone string (national or international form).
2. Normalise to E.164 format (``+<country_code><subscriber>``) where the
   country's dial code is known.

The engine deliberately avoids heavyweight libraries (phonenumbers, libphonenumber)
to stay within the platform's LIGHTWEIGHT principle.  Patterns cover the top
markets served by the regional packs and are based on ITU-T E.164 allocations
and national numbering plans (as of 2026).

Fourteen countries are covered and the rest of the world is not, so every
answer carries a :class:`~app.core.provenance.Provenance` saying which of the
two applied. Coverage is not a detail a caller can afford to be vague about
here: the generic pattern accepts six to fifteen digits, which is looser than
any national rule in the table, so a number a covered country rejects can be
accepted for its uncovered neighbour.

Usage::

    from app.core.validation.phone import validate_phone

    result = validate_phone("030-1234567", country_code="DE")
    assert result.passed
    assert result.e164 == "+49301234567"

#: What :data:`_DEFAULT_PHONE_RULES` is called when a provenance has to name it.
#:
#: Named for what it is rather than for the slot it fills. "DEFAULT" would tell
#: a reader only that the non-default did not answer, which ``answered`` already
#: says on its own. This says what did answer: a count of digits and nothing
#: else. No dial code, no numbering plan, no view on whether the number could be
#: reached. Deliberately not a country code either, since the generic rules are
#: not a jurisdiction.
#:
#: Descriptive, never a discriminant. A caller deciding whether it holds a
#: country-specific answer reads ``source``, or ``answered`` for the boolean;
#: comparing this token against a literal is the wrong idiom and would break the
#: moment a module named its stand-in accurately.
DIGIT_COUNT_ONLY = "DIGIT_COUNT_ONLY"

#: The one axis this module resolves. There is no second: a country either has
#: a row or it does not, and everything in the row - dial code, both regexes,
#: trunk-prefix handling - arrives together. The dial code was the candidate,
#: and it is perfectly correlated with coverage: all 14 entries carry one and
#: the generic rules carry none, so a separate provenance for it would repeat
#: this one in every case rather than distinguishing anything.

def validate_phone(

    """Validate and normalise a phone number string.

    The function accepts national-format numbers (with or without trunk
    prefix), or full E.164 international strings.

    Only fourteen countries have rules here. Everything else is judged by the
    generic pattern, which accepts six to fifteen digits and knows no dial
    code, and ``.jurisdiction`` is what tells the two apart.

    Success no longer implies an E.164 form, and that is a deliberate change.
    A national number for a country with no row cannot be normalised, because
    there is no dial code to put in front of it; the previous behaviour was to
    prefix a bare ``+``, which produced a well-formed number belonging to
    somebody else - ``"301234567"`` for France came back as ``"+301234567"``,
    which is Greece, and with a trunk zero it came back as ``"+0301234567"``,
    which is not a possible E.164 number at all. Both were reported valid. A
    number that cannot be normalised now leaves ``.e164`` None rather than
    inventing one, and ``.passed`` still reports what the syntax check found.

    Args:
        phone:        Raw phone string (e.g. ``"030-1234567"``,
                      ``"+49301234567"``, ``"(030) 123 456 7"``).
        country_code: ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 upper-case country code (e.g.
                      ``"DE"``).  Controls which dial code and regex are
                      used when the number is in national form.

    Returns:
        :class:`PhoneValidationResult` - ``.passed``, ``.e164`` and
        ``.jurisdiction``. A caller that needs a storable number checks
        ``.e164 is not None``; one that needs to know whether the country's own
