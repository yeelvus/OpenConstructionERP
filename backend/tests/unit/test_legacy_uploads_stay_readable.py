"""Files written before upload roots were anchored on the data dir must still be readable.

Moving a write root is only half a repair. Ten modules spent their whole life
writing to a bare ``uploads/...`` literal, so on every deployment that started
the process from the repo root - which is what ``make dev-backend`` and the VPS
both do - real user files physically live at ``<repo>/uploads/...``. Anchoring
the root on the data dir and stopping there would leave every one of those
files addressable by a database row that no longer points at anything: the
upload succeeds, the download 404s, and nobody finds out until a user asks for
a document from last month.

Nothing is moved on disk. Writes go to the data dir, reads probe the active
root first and the old working-directory-relative root second. These tests are
the evidence for that claim, because the fallback is exactly the kind of code
that looks obviously correct and silently resolves to the wrong place: it
depends on the process working directory, on an environment variable, and on
containment checks that must not be fooled by ``..``.

One case deliberately recovers nothing. On the Windows install that motivated
the repair, ``mkdir`` under Program Files raised ``PermissionError``, so no
file was ever written there - there is nothing to fall back to, and the legacy
root correctly finds nothing. The fallback exists for the server and dev
installs, where the writes DID succeed.

The companion guard in ``test_storage_roots_are_data_dir_anchored`` stops a new
module re-introducing the relative root. This file guards the other direction:
that fixing it did not orphan the files already on disk.
