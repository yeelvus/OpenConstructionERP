"""Healing an install that was seeded before Romania's 2025 VAT reform.

What is being tested, and against what
--------------------------------------
``seed.py`` writes ``oe_i18n_tax_config`` only when it is empty, so shipping a
corrected seed file reaches new installations and nobody else. Every database
seeded before 1 August 2025 still carries one open Romanian row at 19 % and no
reduced rate. ``repair_romanian_vat_rates`` is what reaches those, and it runs
from the boot-path registry rather than from a revision body, because this
product does not run ``alembic upgrade``.

**The fixture here is the pre-reform state, built explicitly.** Seeding the
current JSON and running the repair would prove nothing at all: the current
JSON already carries both standard rows and the reduced band, so the repair
would correctly do nothing and the test would pass without ever exercising it.
Every case below starts from the row the old seeder wrote and asserts what the
repair-absent state resolves to before asserting what the repaired one does.

The money assertions
--------------------
Rates are asserted by pricing a real net amount through the resolver the API
serves, not by reading a column back. A rate that round-trips through a field
is not evidence anybody can invoice with it.

Rate sources are cited on ``ROMANIA_VAT_SOURCES`` in
``app/modules/i18n_foundation/romania_vat.py``.
