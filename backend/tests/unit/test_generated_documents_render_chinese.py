"""The generators ask for the Chinese face, and asking changes nothing else.

An earlier change made the face reachable and wired no generator to it, so
every generated document still printed Chinese as boxes. These tests are about
the documents rather than the helper, and they are written to fail on the
failure mode that a weaker test cannot see: a generator that quietly keeps
using the Latin face still produces a valid PDF and still returns two hundred.

The instrument is the produced bytes. Two facts about them separate a rendered
document from a boxed one, and both were measured before being asserted:

  * With the CID face, the Chinese codepoints survive into the content stream
    as UTF-16BE under the standard Adobe-GB1 CMap, so a reader recovers the
    original characters.
  * With the bundled Latin face, reportlab embeds a DejaVu subset that has no
    Han glyph at all, and every Chinese character is written as glyph zero.
    The text extracted from such a document is a run of NUL characters. That
    is the box, and it is unrecoverable: no reader can undo it.

So "renders Chinese" here means the characters came back and no NUL did. It
does not mean any particular reader owns the outlines - the face is referenced
rather than embedded, deliberately, and :mod:`app.core.pdf_fonts` says so.

Every generator below is checked in both directions. The negative control
disables the switch and asserts the same document then comes out boxed; a test
suite where both directions look alike is measuring the PDF library, not us.

    previous implementation rather than against a copy of itself. They walk
    history rather than read HEAD, because HEAD carries the wiring now and a
    test anchored there would skip itself and pass forever without comparing
    anything.

    This needs real git history. CI supplies it with ``fetch-depth: 0`` and
    ``filter: blob:none``, so a ``git show`` here may fetch from origin, and it
    must fail rather than skip if it cannot: the walk runs with ``check=True``
    and nothing catching around it, because a skip CI does not count is a pass
    wearing a different word. The walk grows with the file's history.

    The plain walk runs first and the rename-following one only if it found
    nothing. ``--follow`` diffs blobs to detect renames, so against the blobless
    clone CI checks out it fetches every blob it compares: 188 MB and 15 s,
    against 11 MB and 2 s for the plain walk. Only a rename needs it, so only a
    rename pays for it.

    cannot pass by agreeing with a copy of itself.

    The earlier builder is found by walking the file's history for the most
    recent version that predates the wiring rather than by reading HEAD, because
    HEAD carries the wiring and a test anchored there would skip itself and pass
    forever without comparing anything.

    This compared bytes until the document's tables moved onto Paragraph cells.
    A Paragraph reaches the same coordinates through different operators, so the
    bytes differ where nothing on the page does, and the comparison moved to the
    placement, which is the property the byte check was standing in for. It is
    the weaker check of the two and it is worth saying so: an operator level
    change that leaves every run where it was would now pass here.

    The continuation sheet is left out because it did move, deliberately. Its
    header row asked for white bold text through TEXTCOLOR and FONTNAME table
    commands, and a table command cannot reach a flowable cell, so it had been
    drawn in regular black on a near black fill since the day it was written.
    Giving it the weight it asks for makes two of its labels wrap a line
    further, which shifts the rows under them. It is the only seven point text
    in the document, which is what separates it out here.

    This is also the test that would have caught the whitespace escalation fixed

#
# A font census of this document shows Helvetica among its resources, which
# looks like the half-wired shape: bare string cells drawn under a table that
# names no FONTNAME, falling back to Helvetica and boxing anything outside
# Latin-1. It is not. Helvetica is reportlab's default canvas font, it is
# selected around empty cells and page setup, and it draws no glyphs here at
# all. Measured rather than read: five tables, 68 cells, every one a flowable,
# and pdf_table_font_commands returns nothing for any of them.
#
# So the module needs no wiring. But the reason it is safe is a property of what
# the cells currently are, not of anything in the code: the file carries no
# FONTNAME command anywhere, so the day a bare string cell arrives it will draw
# in Helvetica and box, and nothing in the module will notice. That is what this
# pins. It passes today and fails on the change that would make it matter.
