"""A generated module creates its table on the database it will actually run on.

The unit tests render the module and create its table on SQLite, which proves
the DDL is well formed. It does not prove the things only PostgreSQL enforces:
that the foreign key to the projects table resolves, that NUMERIC keeps its
scale, and that ``create_all`` scoped to one table leaves the platform's own
schema alone on a database that already has all of it.

Those are the failures that would arrive on a user's server at install time, so
they are checked here against a real cluster.
