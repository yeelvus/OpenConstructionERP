"""A schema-version signal must be able to say "I could not tell".

``/api/health`` reports ``alembic_head_matches``, and it used to compute it as
``expected == actual`` on two values either of which can legitimately be absent.
Both absences came out as ``False``, which is not "unknown" but "known wrong",
and consumers act on it. The desktop launcher acted on it hardest: a backend
reporting ``false`` was refused, and refusing meant starting a SECOND backend
against the running one's data directory.

The two absences are ordinary, not exotic:

* ``expected`` is ``None`` wherever no migration tree shipped. That is every
  desktop build, deliberately - the frozen bundle carries neither ``alembic.ini``
  nor the script directory, for reasons ``test_desktop_spec_ships_wheel_data.py``
  sets out at length.
* ``actual`` is ``None`` on any database with no ``alembic_version`` row. That is
  every install created before the boot-time stamp existed, and every install
  where the stamp could not be written - an external PostgreSQL whose role has
  no DDL rights, for one. Those databases are physically at head. Nobody wrote
  it down.

So the helper is tested here rather than the endpoint: the comparison is the
whole defect, it is pure, and pinning it needs no database and no client.
