"""A price analysis has to come out in the shape the estimator's market expects.

``Preset`` has carried a ``region`` field since the presets were written. It is
declared on the dataclass, it is serialised into ``to_dict`` for the UI, and
until now nothing anywhere resolved a preset from it. The endpoint took the
preset by name with ``"international"`` as its default, so a Hungarian
estimator opening a price analysis got the international shape unless they
knew to type ``preset=hu_anyag_dij`` into a query string.

That is not a smaller version of the right answer. A Hungarian bill quotes
every line twice, as anyag and dij, and the split is what the reader compares
tenders on; a single unit rate is a different document, not a plainer one. The
same is true of the German EFB sheet, the UK NRM grouping and the US bid
breakdown. Four of the six presets existed and were unreachable without prior
knowledge of their slugs, which is the same defect the markup region had: the
platform knew the market's convention and never asked itself which market it
was in.

The population check at the bottom is the one that would have caught this. A
preset that declares a region and that no country resolves to is a convention
we wrote down and cannot deliver.
