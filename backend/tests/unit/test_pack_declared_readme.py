"""A pack that declares a readme has to ship one.

``readme = "README.md"`` in ``pyproject.toml`` is not documentation, it is a
build input: setuptools reads the file to fill the distribution's long
description, and a missing file fails the sdist outright. Six packs carried
that declaration with no such file, so their distributions could not be built
at all, and nothing said so until someone tried.

Nothing in the repository builds these packs on every push, which is why the
breakage survived. This test is the cheap standing check that replaces the
build: it costs a stat call per pack and catches the next pack that declares a
readme it does not ship.

Pure filesystem work, no database and no imports from ``app``, so it cannot be
skipped by a database marker.
