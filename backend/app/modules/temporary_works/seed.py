"""Temporary works demo seed - a governance register a coordinator would keep.

Fills every demo project's temporary-works register with the items a real job
carries at once: falsework and formwork still in design, propping and excavation
support bearing load under a live permit, a scaffold approved to strike, and the
hoarding that went up in week one and is still there. Each item names the design
load case it was checked against, the firm that designed it, the firm or engineer
that checked it independently, and the coordinator who holds the permits.

Every row is written through :class:`TemporaryWorksService` and the module's own
create schemas, so the seeded register passes the same ``Literal`` vocabularies,
the same per-project reference uniqueness and the same "a permit belongs to an
item in the same project" guard as an item typed in by hand. A row this seeder
cannot submit is a row the application would have rejected.

What a reader sees on the register screen afterwards:

* ten to nineteen items spread across the whole lifecycle, from ``identified``
  to ``removed``, with one paused on ``on_hold`` - so the screen teaches the
  gated workflow rather than showing one uniform status;
* design-check categories 0 to 3 that match the works, with the category 2 and 3
  items checked by a firm other than the one that designed them, which is what
  those categories mean;
* permits with real validity windows: draft permits on items whose inspection
  before use is still outstanding, live permits under every item bearing load,
  and closed permits behind everything already struck;
* two items under time pressure per project - one past its required load date
  and one past its required strike date - so the overdue lists are not empty;
* on one project only, and never the flagship, a single item whose permit to
  load has lapsed while the works are still in use. That is the register's one
  red flag, and it is the reason the module exists.

Dates are anchored to the run date, never hardcoded, so a demo opened a year
from now still shows a register that is being kept this month.

Self-gating twice over: only projects carrying the demo marker are touched, so a
customer's live project never receives invented safety records, and a project
that already holds a temporary-works item is left alone, so a re-run never
doubles the register.
