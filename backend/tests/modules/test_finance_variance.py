"""Variance answers how much of the budget is still free.

The defect these tests hold is not arithmetic that went wrong once. It is a
rule that was written separately at each caller, so correcting one of them left
the others quietly disagreeing, and the disagreement was invisible because each
copy was internally consistent. The budget row, the dashboard header and the
Excel export each subtracted a different thing from the same budget.

Underneath all three, none of them counted committed money. A line with 48.7
budgeted, 12.4 spent and 33.4 under signed order reported 36.3 of headroom in
green. That number appeared on the very screen a cost manager reads before
deciding whether there is room for something else.

The free figure on that line is 15.3, not 2.9. `committed` is gross here: it
includes what has already been invoiced, so it is compared against spend rather
than added to it. That is not an assumption, it is what the writers do. The
generated seeder sets committed at 0.7 of original and spend at 0.5 of the same
original, and every hand-authored line carries a commitment at or above its
spend - 420000 committed against 395000 spent, 650000 against 380000. Nothing
anywhere decrements the field as invoices land. Adding the two would count
every invoiced order twice and report a project as nearly exhausted while half
its budget was still free, which is the same defect wearing the other face.
