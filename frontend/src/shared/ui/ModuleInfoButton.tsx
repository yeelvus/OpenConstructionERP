// ModuleInfoButton — the re-open control for a collapsed module info block.
//
// Founder revision 2026-08-07: a collapsed block folds into an information
// icon sitting immediately to the RIGHT OF THE MODULE NAME, which is where
// this control lived originally. The Header hosts it, right after the module
// title, so it is in the same place on every page in the product.
//
// It used to be a labelled pill down in the page's action row, next to "How
// it works" (founder 2026-07-23). That placement moved with the page: a module
// with a wide action row pushed it off to a different spot than the module
// next door, and on a long page the reader had to find it again each time. The
// module name never moves, so anchoring to the name is what makes the control
// learnable. There is now exactly one of these on screen, never two.
//
// Icon rather than icon-plus-label because the top bar is dense and shared
// with the project switcher, the search box and the action cluster; a word
// there would push the module name into truncation at lg widths, which is the
// bug the title's own sizing comment already records. The accessible name
// carries the meaning instead, so nothing is lost to a screen reader.
//
// It self-hides whenever nothing on the page is collapsed, so a page with its
// info block open shows no extra chrome at all.
