"""Fail if the demo seed pool can still produce a real firm name.

The demo data ships with invented contractors, clients and consultants. Real
firms had leaked into it, were removed, and the removal is held by
``backend/tests/unit/test_demo_seed_has_no_real_firm_names.py``. That test reads
source *text*, which is the right surface for a literal but the wrong one for a
name that is assembled at runtime: ``app/modules/subcontractors/seed.py`` builds
a ``legal_name`` with an f-string, and no text scan can evaluate it.

This check reads the pool instead. It loads the demo template registry the
installer actually consumes and walks every string in it, so what is tested is
the value that reaches the database rather than the expression that produces it.

The denylist is not duplicated here. Both the entries and the matching rules are
imported from the test module above, so the two cannot drift apart, and adding a
name in one place arms both. Like that module, it stores only SHA-256 hashes of
lowercased names, so this file puts no firm name in the repo, and a match is
reported in a masked form.

No database is involved. Importing the registry pulls in the ORM, which builds
an engine at import time, so a throwaway PostgreSQL URL is set below. SQLAlchemy
does not dial an engine until it is used and nothing here uses it, so the URL
points at a port nothing listens on rather than at anything real.

Three ways this check can be green while the pool is dirty, each of which is
therefore a failure and not a pass:

* No template loads. A comparison over zero items always succeeds.
* A pack file exists but registered no template. The loader in
  ``app/core/demo_packs/__init__.py`` deliberately swallows a broken pack so it
  cannot break boot, which means a pack can drop out of the pool in silence and
  take its names with it.
* The text surfaces come back empty, which means the glob stopped matching.

Exit codes:
    0  no denylisted name is reachable from the pool or present in the sources
    1  at least one is, or the pool could not be measured
