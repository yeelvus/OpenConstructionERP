"""Teams service - business logic for team management.

Stateless service layer. Handles:

- Team CRUD within projects
- Membership management (add / remove / change role / list)
- Record-level visibility restrictions and the reports built on them

Authorisation model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Two distinct gates, and the difference between them matters:

``_assert_project_access``
    Can the caller reach this project at all? Owner, system admin, or anyone
    holding a membership row on one of its teams. Denial is 404, so a project
    id cannot be walked to learn whether it exists. Used for every READ.

``_assert_project_admin``
    May the caller change who is on this project? Owner or system admin only.
    Denial is 403 when the caller can already see the project (they know it
    exists, so there is nothing left to leak) and 404 when they cannot. Used
    for every WRITE.

The second gate is the one that keeps the invariant. A membership row is what
:func:`app.dependencies.verify_project_access` reads to grant project access,
so anyone who can write memberships can hand out project access. Gating writes
on mere project access would therefore let a plain team member add an outsider
and give them a project they could not previously see - the exact escalation
this module exists to prevent. ``projects/router.py`` already gates its own
member endpoints on ownership (``_verify_project_owner``); this brings the
teams module in line with it instead of leaving a second, laxer door.

Elevated team roles (``owner`` / ``project_manager``) additionally carry
manager rights in other modules (``erp_chat`` reads them as such), so they stay
restricted to project owners and system admins even inside the admin gate.

Visibility restrictions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
An ``EntityVisibility`` row narrows a record from "every project member" to
"the named teams, plus the project owner and system admins". It never widens.
Consumers subtract :func:`app.modules.teams.access.hidden_entity_ids` from a
set they have already decided the caller may see.
