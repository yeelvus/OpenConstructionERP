"""E-invoice clearance ORM models.

Tables:
    oe_einvoice_clearance_profile  - how one legal entity is registered in one
        country: the regime, the tax registration, the network participant id,
        the certificate the platform signs with, and whether it is pointed at a
        sandbox.
    oe_einvoice_clearance_document - one invoice on its way through a country's
        platform: what was submitted, what came back, and where it now stands.
    oe_einvoice_clearance_event    - the append-only trail behind that status.

No ``relationship()`` is declared. Everything here is reached by id from the
service, so there is no lazy-loading strategy to choose and no
``MissingGreenlet`` to avoid.

Foreign keys
============
Only the two intra-module links are foreign keys. ``project_id`` and
``invoice_id`` are plain ``GUID`` columns, which is what ``finance.Invoice``
itself does with ``project_id`` and ``source_claim_id``. It also happens to be
the right answer here for a second reason: a cleared document is a fiscal
record whose counterpart is held by a tax authority, and deleting our copy of an
invoice must not delete the record of the identifier that authority issued.

The two intra-module foreign keys carry explicit names. Under the metadata
naming convention the generated name would be over the 63-byte PostgreSQL limit
and would be truncated with a hash, which is deterministic but leaves the
``create_all`` schema and the migration disagreeing about a constraint name for
no reason.

Nothing is ever queried *inside* ``country_fields`` or ``raw_response``. On
PostgreSQL a ``.contains()`` on a JSON column compiles to a string LIKE rather
than to JSONB containment, so a filter written that way would quietly mean
something else. Filtering is on real columns only.
