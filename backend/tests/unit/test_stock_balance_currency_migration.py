"""Classification rules of the v3304 stock-cost-currency migration.

The migration decides, per stock balance, whether its stored average cost was
denominated in one currency all along ("single", keep the number), blended two
or more ("mixed", withdraw it), or cannot be traced ("unknown", withdraw it).
That decision is a pure function over the currencies of the balance's inbound
movements, so it is tested here without a database.

The cases that matter are the ones where a wrong answer is silent: an empty
list must not read as agreement, and one unresolvable movement among many good
ones must not be outvoted, because the stored average was computed over all of
them.
