# DDC-CWICR-OE: DataDrivenConstruction - OpenConstructionERP
# Copyright (c) 2026 Artem Boiko / DataDrivenConstruction
"""Shared company branding for every reportlab-generated PDF (issue #284).

Every PDF generator in the platform used to hard-code the literal
``"OpenConstructionERP"`` brand string, the ``#1a1a2e`` accent and the
author / creator document metadata. A workspace that white-labels the app
(see :mod:`app.core.app_branding` - the persisted logo / company name set by
the admin) therefore still printed the default brand on every exported
estimate, diary and invoice, which defeated the customisation (issue #284
follow-up to #272).

This module is the one place that turns the persisted branding into PDF
output, so wiring a generator is a 3-8 line swap rather than a copy of the
header / footer / metadata logic into each module:

* :func:`branded_header_footer` - an ``onPage(canvas, doc)`` callback that
  draws the workspace brand (the uploaded logo rasterised from its base64
  data URL, else the company name, else the default text) in the page header
  and a ``Generated ...`` line plus a page number in the footer. Geometry is
  read from the live ``doc`` (pagesize / margins) so it preserves whatever
  layout the calling generator already uses.
* :func:`branded_cover_brand` - the brand string for a cover-page title
  (logo cover art is out of scope for this MVP; the cover shows the name).
* :func:`branded_doc_metadata` - the ``author`` / ``creator`` / ``subject`` /
  ``producer`` / ``keywords`` to stamp on the ``DocTemplate`` so the file's
  document properties also carry the workspace brand.

Everything degrades gracefully and NEVER raises (mirrors the never-break
contract of :mod:`app.core.pdf_stamp`): a logo that fails to decode falls
back to the company name, an empty company name falls back to the default
brand, and any failure reading the persisted branding falls back to the
default too. A failed brand draw must never break a PDF export.

Deferred follow-up (out of scope for this MVP, by design): a configurable
template engine - per-workspace margins / fonts / colours / header layout /
footer text - and rendering the logo as cover-page art. Today the accent
colour and geometry stay the platform defaults; only the brand identity
(logo / name) and document metadata follow the workspace.
