// levelingGuide - "How it works" content for the Resource Leveling module.
// Consumed by <ModuleGuideButton content={levelingGuide} /> on
// ResourceLevelingPage, mirroring portfolioGuide on CapacityPlanningPage.
//
// The text describes what this page ACTUALLY does: it compares booked
// allocation against each resource's declared capacity and proposes one
// action per over-booked period. It deliberately does NOT promise levelling
// within float or a recomputed finish date - that engine exists elsewhere and
// is not what this surface runs, and a guide that oversells the page is worse
// than no guide at all.
//
// i18n: every key carries its inline English default and is read via
// t(key, { defaultValue }). These keys are NOT added to en.ts or any locale
// file; the inline defaults are the single source of truth, same convention
// as portfolioGuide.
