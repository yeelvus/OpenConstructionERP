// Case: "Balance crews and plant across the programme".
//
// A project manager case: read the labour and plant the near-term programme
// actually needs, check it against what is booked on site, and close the gap
// before a task stalls for want of a hand or a machine. Content strings are
// key plus inline English default and live only here.
