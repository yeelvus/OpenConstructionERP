// Case: "Record a change under a CCDC-family contract" (CA).
//
// The objection is "our changes get sorted out on site and written up later",
// and later is when the memory of who agreed what has gone. The case follows
// the order the standard forms impose: notice first, valuation second by a
// route the contract names, and the contract price as a derived figure with a
// reason for every movement. The notice periods are stated in WORKING days, so
// the step tells the user to count them against their own site calendar and
// record the date rather than to assume a count. Content strings are key plus
// inline English default and live only here.

    "The standard forms in the CCDC family put a bar in front of every change. A concealed or unknown condition, a delay and a claim each carry their own notice period, and a claim that misses one can be lost on the notice rather than on the merits, however good the merits are. What follows the notice is a valuation, and the general conditions for a change directive name the routes that will be accepted: the contract's own unit prices, cost plus a fixed or percentage fee, or an estimated and accepted lump sum with its supporting documentation. The change order clause names no method at all and expects the parties to have agreed one in the supplementary conditions, which is worth reading before you need it rather than after. One detail decides more disputes than any other: these periods are stated in working days, not calendar days, so count them against the site calendar with the statutory holidays your province actually keeps, and write the resulting date on the notice. A contract under the Civil Code of Quebec argues a change under different articles and is not covered here.",
