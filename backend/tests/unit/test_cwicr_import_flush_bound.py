"""The cost import must hand rows over in bounded slices, never in one list.

This pins the shape of the memory the import holds while it runs, which
nothing else observes. The import used to build every row of a region before
the first insert; a catalogue of tens of thousands of items then needed more
resident memory than the small servers the platform promises to run on, and
the kernel killed the process part way through. What the operator saw was a
server that stopped, not an import that failed, so the symptom pointed at
everything except the import.

The bound is checked by watching the sizes the inserter is called with rather
than by measuring memory. The size is the thing this code actually decides;
resident memory is decided by the allocator, the reader and the garbage
collector as well, and a test that measured it would fail for reasons that had
nothing to do with this loop.

The last test is the control. It runs the same import with the bound raised
out of reach, which is what removing the flush would look like from inside the
loop, and asserts the single unbounded batch that would then appear. Without
it the other three only prove that an import happened, not that the bound is
what shaped it.

No database is involved: the single function that touches PostgreSQL is
replaced, so what remains is the parquet reader and the batching loop.
