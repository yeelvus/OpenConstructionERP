/**
 * Connectivity and the pending-entry queue, as one hook for the Field Time page.
 *
 * What it owes the person using it is honesty. A day recorded in a basement is
 * not saved, it is *pending*, and the difference matters: a foreman who thinks
 * the day is in the office will not look at it again. So the hook reports the
 * queue depth, drains on reconnect, and keeps the outcome of the last drain
 * broken out by kind - because "3 synced" and "3 synced, 1 refused" are
 * different sentences and only one of them needs somebody to act.
 *
 * The drain is deliberately not silent about refusals. An op the server will
 * never accept (the day was withdrawn, or the office approved it before the
 * correction arrived) leaves the queue, and if nothing said so the foreman's
 * correction would vanish with it.
