"""The sections a package was raised over can be read, not only computed.

``create_from_boq`` has recorded ``source_section_ids`` in the package metadata
since it was written, and nothing has ever read it back. The comparison and
levelling screens narrow to that scope, so the number a bidder is measured
against already depends on it, but the reader could not see which part of the
bill was in play: a package over one trade looked exactly like a package over
the whole thing.

Two writers declare a scope and they say it differently, which is why the
derivation exists. ``create_from_boq`` names the sections; the demo installer
records a flat position list. When only the flat list is there the sections are
derived by walking each in-scope position up to its top-level ancestor, and the
answer says it was derived rather than recorded.

Pure over stub positions, so it needs no database, the same as the filter it
sits beside.
