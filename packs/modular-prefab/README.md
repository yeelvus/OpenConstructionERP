# Modular & Prefab Pack

Pre-configures OpenConstructionERP for modular construction, off-site
fabrication and project management contractors. Where a country pack carries a
jurisdiction, this one carries a delivery method: factory-line scheduling,
dimensional tolerance control, transport logistics, inter-module assembly and
phased handover.

## What this pack enables

- Currency EUR and the English locale; no tax template, because the pack
  crosses jurisdictions and the tax regime comes from wherever the project
  sits
- Seven validation rule packs: `en_1090_steel`, `as_5104_modular`,
  `modular_standards`, `factory_qc_schedule`, `factory_qc_tolerances`,
  `transport_logistics` and `module_handover_protocol`
- The `cwicr-eng-london` cost region, which loads on demand
- A six-step onboarding wizard: company profile, module typology, standards,
  DfMA maturity, logistics and review
- Two repeatable-housing demo projects, `modular-housing` and
  `residential-berlin`
- Industrial blue and modular yellow for co-branding

No modules are hidden and no new rule classes ship with the pack; it switches
on rules already present in the core.

## Cost data

**No cost database is bundled.** This pack is a method, not a price book: it
brings the factory and logistics rules that a site-built estimate has no
place for, and leaves the rates to you. Import your own fabrication and
transport costs, or load a cost region from the marketplace, and the rules
check the schedule and the tolerances around them.

Because the pack is cross-regional, it makes no assumption about which market
your rates come from. It preloads the London cost region only as a starting
point.
