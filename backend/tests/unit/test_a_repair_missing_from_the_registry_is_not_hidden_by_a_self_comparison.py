"""A repair that drops out of the registry has to be visible to something.

The assertion this replaces
---------------------------
``tests/pg/test_data_repairs.py`` guarded the completeness of a repair pass with
``assert report.attempted == len(DATA_REPAIRS)``. Read the two sides. The report
is what running the registry produced, so ``attempted`` counts registry entries;
``len(DATA_REPAIRS)`` counts the same registry. When a repair falls out of it -
its module stops importing, its registration is deleted, discovery is narrowed -
both sides fall by one together and the assertion holds. It was written to catch
a repair going missing and was the one shape of check that could not.

That is the same mistake as the one next door, where a module that failed to
import produced the health verdict of a flawless boot: a measurement that cannot
tell "nothing ran" from "everything is fine". The registry is not evidence about
itself.

What replaces it
----------------
``tests/_repair_registry_source.py`` reads the ``register_data_repair()`` calls
out of ``app/**/repairs.py`` as source text. That reading does not move when the
registry does, which is the whole property being bought: a module that will not
import still has its registration sitting in the file.

The first test below drops one repair and then asserts *both* comparisons, so
the vacuity is measured rather than asserted in a comment. The old one still
passes over the damaged registry. The new one names the repair that went
missing.
