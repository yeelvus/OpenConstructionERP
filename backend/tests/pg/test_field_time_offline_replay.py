# DDC-CWICR-OE: DataDrivenConstruction - OpenConstructionERP
"""A day recorded with no signal reaches the office once, however often it is sent.

A foreman in a basement or a lift shaft has no data. The device keeps the day in
a local queue and replays it when there is signal, and that replay is
at-least-once by construction: a reconnect can fire twice, and a request whose
response was lost on the way back looks exactly like one that never arrived. So
every delivery of the same day has to land on the same timesheet.

What is asserted here is the part that arithmetic cannot check:

* a replayed create returns the original timesheet and writes no second row;
* a replayed update converges, because each op carries the entry's whole state
  rather than a diff;
* a withdrawal that overtakes its own creation still wins - the day the foreman
  deleted must not come back when the create behind it finally arrives;
* a withdrawal is refused once the day has been sent on for approval;
* an entry key that belongs to another project, or that the field diary already
  spent, is refused rather than followed to whatever row it happens to resolve.

That last one is the one with money behind it. Approving a timesheet posts
labour actuals and takes the ``(project, day, worker)`` claim in the cost model,
the claim is released by reversing the timesheet, and nothing in the database
ties the claim to the timesheet row. Deleting an approved timesheet would
therefore leave a claim that nothing can ever release: neither a corrected sheet
nor the phone could ever cost that day again. The refusal is the guard, so it is
asserted against a real approval with a real claim standing behind it.

PostgreSQL, not SQLite: the idempotency promise leans on a unique constraint to
settle two drains racing on one key, and a constraint that is never exercised
against a real transaction is a comment.
