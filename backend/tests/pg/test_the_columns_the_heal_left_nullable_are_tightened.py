"""Can anything put back the NOT NULL the boot heal had to decline.

``not_null_divergences`` reports the divergence and stops there; nothing on the
boot path tightened the column afterwards. These tests cover the repair that
does, on a table driven into exactly the state the heal leaves behind: column
present, nullable, no default, rows already in it holding NULL.

The controls carry the weight, as they do for the divergence check itself. A
repair that rewrote every row, or that dropped the constraint instead of adding
it, would satisfy the first test here and be worse than doing nothing. So one
test pins that a row holding a real value keeps it, one pins that a column both
sides already agree about is not touched at all, and one runs the whole thing
twice because the registry runs it on every boot.

The last test is the one that would catch this drifting apart again: it holds
the repairs' column lists against the models, so a column renamed in
``models.py`` cannot leave a repair quietly naming something that is no longer
there.
