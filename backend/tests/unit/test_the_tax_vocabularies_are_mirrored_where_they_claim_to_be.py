"""Two vocabularies in this module are copied by hand and say so in a comment.

``schemas.py`` carries a ``Literal`` that mirrors ``TAX_COMBINATIONS`` in
models.py and another that mirrors ``ResolutionStatus`` in tax_rules.py. Both
comments say "Mirrors". Nothing made either of them true.

Why it matters, in the direction that hurts. ``TaxResolutionStatus`` is what
the response model validates against, so a status added to the resolver and
not to the schema does not degrade - it turns the countries the new status was
written for into failed requests. That is worse than the answer it replaced,
and no test over ``resolve()`` can see it, because ``resolve()`` is right.
This was live while ``default_rate_not_in_force`` was being added and the only
thing that caught it was somebody reading the second file.

The sibling case is the one this file is built around rather than the pair.
A gate that checks the two mirrors we have today is blind to the third one
somebody writes next month, which is the same defect wearing the next
costume: a scope written as a name cannot see a sibling holding the same
thing. So the mirrors are discovered from the source comment that claims the
mirroring, and a claim with no entry in the table below is itself a failure.
