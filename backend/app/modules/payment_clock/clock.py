"""The payment clock arithmetic. Pure functions, no database, no ORM.

Everything here takes a plain mapping in the shape of one entry of
:data:`app.modules.payment_clock.data.PAYMENT_REGIMES` and returns plain
values, so the statutory arithmetic can be read and tested on its own. The
service layer converts an ORM row into that shape with
:func:`app.modules.payment_clock.service.regime_spec` and never asks this
module to touch a session.

The sequence, in the order a job actually runs it::

    application  ->  due date  ->  payment notice deadline
                 ->  pay-less deadline  ->  final date for payment
                 ->  statutory interest

Two things about counting days are worth stating plainly because getting them
wrong moves every date in the sequence.

**Business days are Monday to Friday minus a calendar the deployment
supplies.** Australian and Singaporean statutes say "business days", the New
Zealand Act says "working days", and both mean a day that is not a weekend and
not a public holiday. Public holidays are not shipped here: they differ by
jurisdiction and change every year, and a wrong holiday list is worse than an
honest weekends-only count because it produces a date nobody can reproduce.
Callers with a holiday calendar pass it as ``holidays``. Two statutory
year-end exclusions are in the same position and are noted on their regimes:
New South Wales excludes 27 to 31 December, and New Zealand excludes 24
December to 5 January.

**Day one is the day after the start date.** "Not later than five days after
the due date" means the five days begin the day after, which is how every one
of these statutes counts and how a court reads them.
