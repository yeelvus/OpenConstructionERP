"""Integrity tests for the partner-pack flagship country projects.

Each active partner pack ships one fully worked-out demo project authored as
a standalone ``DemoTemplate`` under ``app/core/demo_packs/``. These templates
are merged into ``DEMO_TEMPLATES``, surfaced in ``DEMO_CATALOG``, and mapped
to their pack via ``PACK_DEMO_PROJECT`` so an active pack auto-installs its
country project on first boot.

This module asserts the wiring stays consistent:
1. Every discovered partner pack slug has a demo-project mapping.
2. Every mapped demo_id resolves to a loaded ``DemoTemplate``.
3. Every pack demo project appears in the marketplace catalog with the
   required keys and a derived ISO-2 country.
4. Each pack template is substantial and structurally valid (sections with
   items, allowed units, positive quantities/rates).

# Units accepted by the BOQ position model / demo installer.
# Includes locale-authentic codes the flagship country demos use on purpose:
# Brazil "vb" (verba / lump sum), "un" (unidade), "mes" (month); India "MT"
# (metric tonne), "rm" (running metre); Canada "suite". The China GB/T
# 50500-2013 demo uses the standard Chinese measurement words: "项" (xiang,
# lump-sum work item, like "lsum"), "台" (tai, a machine/equipment set), "樘"
# (tang, a door/window leaf), "组" (zu, a group/set), "套" (tao, a set/system),
# "根" (gen, a long single piece such as a pile or rod). Hungary uses the
# tetelrend words "db" (darab, piece), "klt" (keszlet, set), "ho" (month) and
# "nap" (day), plus "kWp" for photovoltaic capacity. Russia uses GESN measurers,
# which carry the norm multiplier in the unit itself: "100 m2" means the rate is
# per hundred square metres, which is how the resource-index method prices a
# norm, so the scaled forms are units in their own right and not a formatting
# accident. Cyrillic month and Latin "mes" look near-identical and are two
# separate tokens on purpose. The Latin one is a single token serving both
# Portuguese and Spanish, which is why the Spanish block below does not repeat
# it. Six more markets joined with their own
# measurers rather than translated ones, which is the whole reason this
# allowlist grows by market instead of being replaced with a generic set: the
# Spanish, Dutch, Polish, Turkish, Japanese and Korean blocks below each carry
# the word a local estimator would actually read on the line.

# ── The classification standard a demo declares ───────────────────────────
#
# ``resolve_standard`` returns the requested standard when the registry knows
# it and otherwise falls back, first to whatever the region maps to and then
# to the global default, saying nothing either way. So a template can declare
# one standard, be stored under another, and look correct from every angle
# except a direct comparison.

#: Demos whose declared standard the registry does not know.
#:
#: ``hospital-lyon`` declares ``dpgf`` and is stored as ``untec``, because
#: ``COUNTRY_TO_STANDARD`` maps FR to untec and dpgf is in neither
#: ``KNOWN_CLASSIFICATION_STANDARDS`` (13 names) nor
#: ``CLASSIFICATION_STANDARD_LABELS`` (18 names).
#:
#: Everything else about that demo is dpgf and is coherent: its 119 priced
#: lines are keyed ``classification["dpgf"]``, its rule set is ``dpgf``, and
#: ``dpgf.lot_required`` reads that exact key. The standard it is stored under,
#: untec, has no rules in the engine at all. So the question this entry holds
#: open is which of the two France should classify to, and that is a product
#: decision rather than something a test may settle.
#:
#: Named rather than skipped by a wildcard, so a second demo cannot join the
#: same silence, and ``test_the_standard_allowlist_still_describes_the_tree``
#: fails the day the registry learns dpgf.
