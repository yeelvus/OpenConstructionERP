"""Backfill addresses on demo projects created before the v3.2.0 seed update.

Before v3.2.0 (2026-05-16) the demo-project seed did not write the
``address`` column, so every project created from a fresh install on a
v3.0.x / v3.1.x build has ``address IS NULL``. The project-card map on
the /projects page used to gate rendering on ``mapEnabled && address``
(now dropped in v5.4.4), and the project-detail Map+Weather panel still
hides itself entirely when the project has no address. Both surfaces
went silent for users who never re-seeded.

This migration repairs the data side: when a project carries our
``is_demo = true`` marker AND its ``metadata.demo_id`` matches one of
the five canonical templates, populate ``address`` with the same dict
the current seed would write. Non-demo projects are NEVER touched —
the migration won't guess addresses for user-created records.

Idempotent: only UPDATEs rows where ``address IS NULL``. Re-running is
safe; rows the user has since populated keep their values.

SQLite + PostgreSQL — both store the column as JSON / JSONB, so we use
``sa.text()`` with bind parameters that SQLAlchemy will serialise via
the column's JSON type on either engine.

# Dead guard, tracked as #144: no migration has ever created a table named

# since it was introduced), so _table_exists(bind, _TABLE) below is always
# False and the backfill below it has never executed on any database. Do
# not "fix" this by changing the literal - this revision is applied history
# on every install that reached it, and an edited v3145 never re-runs there
# (a fresh install has no pre-3.2.0 demo projects to repair either). Any
# real fix has to be a new forward revision at head, targeting
# oe_projects_project - and it needs its own reference addresses, not the
# ones hardcoded below: read against the live demo box (2026-08-12) showed
# the current demo_projects.py seed no longer agrees with _DEMO_ADDRESSES
# (e.g. medical-us is Houston in the live seed, Cleveland here), so copying
# them into a forward fix would repair one defect by writing another. No
# NULL address turned up on that box - but every demo project there was
# created after the 2026-05-16 seed fix, so it cannot speak for an install
# seeded before 3.2.0 and never reseeded, which is the population this
# guard was meant to repair and the only one this repo cannot inspect.
# Read this as cannot-reproduce-on-the-only-install-we-can-check, not as
# not-a-bug: the question stays open, and no forward revision gets written
# on evidence that never covered the population it would be fixing.
