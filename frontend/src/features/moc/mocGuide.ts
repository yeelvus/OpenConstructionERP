// mocGuide - "How it works" content for the Management of Change module.
// Consumed by <ModuleGuideButton content={mocGuide} /> on MoCPage.
//
// i18n: every key carries its inline English default and is read via
// t(key, { defaultValue }). The keys are not in en.ts, the inline defaults
// are the English source; their translations live in the other locale files,
// so a changed default needs its translations redone too.
