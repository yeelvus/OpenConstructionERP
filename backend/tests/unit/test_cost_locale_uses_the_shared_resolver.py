"""The cost routes resolve a reader with the shared rule, not a copy of it.

``app/core/document_locale.py`` was extracted so the rule would live in one
place, and its docstring says so. That was not true when it was written:
``costs/router.py`` already carried a line-for-line copy of the same algorithm
over a different catalogue, serving three routes, and the extraction never
reached it. A docstring vouching for single-sourcing while a copy runs beside
it is worse than no docstring, because it answers the question wrongly to
anyone who checks.

The table below was captured from the copy *before* it was removed. That is
what makes it evidence rather than description: every value is what the old
implementation actually returned, so the current implementation reproducing
them is a statement about behaviour and not about intent. The two were also
compared across 340 combinations of an awkward input matrix, with no
disagreement, which is how the fold was known to be safe before it happened.

Two rows are worth reading twice.

``(None, "de;q=0.1,fr;q=0.9", "de")`` looks wrong and is not. Quality weights
are ignored on purpose: header order is the browser's preference order in
practice, and a single best match is all a catalogue lookup needs. A caller
who ranks French above German still gets German here, because German comes
first in the header and French is not in the cost catalogue at all.

``(None, "zh-Hans-CN", "en")`` is a coverage fact, not a resolution bug. The
CWICR catalogue holds sixteen languages and Chinese is not among them, even
though the interface ships it.
