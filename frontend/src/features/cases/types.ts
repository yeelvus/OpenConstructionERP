// Cases (playbooks) - data model.
//
// A "case" is a cross-module, end-to-end guided scenario. The platform already
// explains each module on its own (Module Guides, the How-it-works hub, the
// journey map); a case is the missing worked example that walks a user THROUGH
// several modules in order, telling them WHAT to do and WHY at each step, with
// a "Go" button that drops them into the real module.
//
// i18n convention: every user-facing string on a Playbook / PlaybookStep is a
// key PLUS an inline English default (the same key + defaultValue pattern used
// by ModuleGuide and the *Guide.ts files). Playbook CONTENT strings live ONLY
// in the data files - they are NEVER added to en.ts. Only the framework chrome
// (page title, runner buttons, labels) is seeded into en.ts. Translators pick
// the inline-default content keys up later.

/**

 * what goes IN to the step and what comes OUT. `label` is the English fallback;
 * pass `labelKey` to localize it (same key + fallback pattern as `moduleLabel`).

/**
 * One step of a playbook: a single thing the user does, in one module.
 *
 * `to` is a real app route and MAY contain a `:projectId` slot
 * (e.g. `/projects/:projectId/boq`). When the user has picked a sample project
 * the slot is filled in; when they have not, the `/projects/:projectId`
 * prefix is stripped so the module opens unscoped (see `resolveStepRoute`).
 *
 * `moduleLabel` is the short module name shown as a chip on the step
 * (e.g. "BOQ"). Pass `moduleLabelKey` to reuse an existing translated
 * sidebar/nav key (e.g. `boq.title`) so the chip is localized for free;
 * when omitted the plain `moduleLabel` renders.
 *
 * The two are a pair and must name the same module. Only the key is
 * translated, so `moduleLabel` decides what an English reader sees and
 * `moduleLabelKey` decides what everyone else sees. A step carrying
 * `moduleLabel: "Files"` next to `moduleLabelKey: "nav.documents"` reads as
 * Files in English and as the word for Documents in the other 27 languages,
 * and no locale gate can see it, because nothing is untranslated.
 *
 * Correcting one side alone is worse than leaving both wrong. The marketing
 * case pages copy this chip into the module honeycomb by matching the label
 * text, so a fixed label next to a stale key starts matching and carries the
 * wrong translation to more cells than before, while reading in review as the
 * fix working.
 *
 * A short label is not a local choice either. `moduleLabel: "BOQ"` with
 * `moduleLabelKey: "boq.title"` renders BOQ in English and "Bill of
 * Quantities" in every other language, because the key decides and the label
 * is only the English fallback. Choose the key whose value you want read
 * aloud, not the one whose name looks closest to the label.
 *
 * `spotlightSelector` is an optional CSS selector reserved for a future
 * in-module highlight (it mirrors ModuleGuide's spotlight contract). It is
 * carried on the model now so data files can declare it without a later
 * schema change.
