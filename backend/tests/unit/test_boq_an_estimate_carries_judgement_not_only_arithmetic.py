"""An estimate carries judgement, not only arithmetic - issue #453.

Three measures had no home in the model. Each is here for a different reason
and each fails in its own way if it is put in the wrong place:

* **Dispersion.** ``confidence`` says how sure the estimator is. It cannot say
  how wrong the line could be, and that is the question an offer is tested
  against: a margin that survives the declared risk is ``target - z * sigma``
  weighted by amount. With a confidence score alone there is no sigma to put
  in it. ``risk_dispersion`` is that sigma, and the thing to get right is that
  an unjudged line has to stay out of the average rather than read as zero,
  because a zero dispersion is a claim of certainty and it is the one reading
  that makes a bill look safer than it is.

* **Schedule.** Duration prices site overhead and it is what a client asks
  about before margin, but the KPI catalogue offered only bills and their
  lines, so no KPI could answer how long anything takes. The values CPM has
  already computed are enough; what this does NOT add is a calendar span for
  the project itself, and the test at the bottom says so out loud rather than
  leaving a reader to find out from an empty picker.

* **Price basis.** ``source`` looks like the answer and is not. It records how
  the row was entered, defaults to ``manual``, and is written literally by
  every ordinary create path - so on a typed bill it is ``manual`` on nearly
  every row and a KPI grouped by it returns a number near 100% that means
  nothing at all. The reporter measured 257 of 258. A hand-typed row can have
  an invoice behind it and a catalogue row can rest on a guess, which is why
  the two axes cannot share a column, and the tests here assert they are two
  columns rather than two names for one.
