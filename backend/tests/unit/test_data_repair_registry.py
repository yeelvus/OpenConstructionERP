"""The gate reads the repair registry as source text, so the two must not drift.

``scripts/check_data_rewrite_boot_repair.py`` validates a revision's
``# boot-repair: registry=<id>`` line against the ``register_data_repair()``
calls in every ``app/**/repairs.py``, and it parses those files with ``ast``
rather than importing them: importing pulls in SQLAlchemy and ``app.database``,
which builds an engine from the environment, so a source-text gate would
otherwise need a configured database to answer a question about source text.

The shortcut has the failure mode every shortcut of that shape has. A
registration written in a form the parser does not recognise - built in a loop,
given a computed id - reads back as fewer entries, or as none, and the gate
then rejects a ``registry=`` line that names a repair that really is
registered. Or, worse, the parser keeps working while the runner is handed a
different set.

Since the registry became dynamic there is a second, sharper failure mode, and
it is the one this file exists for. Registration happens when a module's
``repairs.py`` is imported. **A module that is not imported registers nothing,
and a repair that is not registered does not run** - silently, with the boot
reporting success, which is the exact defect the whole data-repair mechanism
was written to remove. Reintroducing it through the fix would be the worst
possible outcome, so the static reading and the post-discovery registry are
compared here in both directions.
