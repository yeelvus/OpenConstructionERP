"""Event bus​‌‍⁠​‌‍⁠​‌‍⁠​‌‍⁠ for inter-module communication.

Modules publish events; other modules subscribe to them.
Supports both sync and async handlers.
Decouples modules from each other - no direct imports needed.

Usage:
    # Publishing (in boq module):
    await event_bus.publish("boq.position.created", {"position_id": "...", "boq_id": "..."})

    # Subscribing (in validation module):
    @event_bus.on("boq.position.created")

    Every subscriber on the bus opens its OWN session via
    ``async_session_factory()``, because the bus carries no caller-session
    context. Publishing from inside a still-open transaction therefore hands
    those subscribers a row that no other session can see yet: they either read
    nothing, or their own insert fails against a parent that is not committed,
    and the failure is swallowed by the subscriber's own error handling.
    Deferring the publish to ``after_commit`` removes the window entirely -
    by the time a subscriber runs, the row it was told about is durable.

    The publish itself is still detached (:meth:`EventBus.publish_detached`), so
    this changes *when* subscribers are scheduled and never makes ``commit()``
    wait for them. The SQLite single-writer reason detaching exists for is
    untouched.

    ``data`` is built by the caller before this returns, so every value in the
    payload is already a snapshot. Do not pass a dict you go on to mutate, and
    do not put a live ORM instance in it: the publish runs during the commit,
    which is not a safe moment to load an attribute off one.

    Failures are contained. If the hook cannot be registered - no transaction
    open, or a session that cannot be inspected, as with a test double - the
    publish happens immediately, which is exactly what a bare
    ``publish_detached`` would have done. Anything the publish raises is logged
    rather than allowed to escape out of ``commit()`` and fail a request whose
    work already succeeded.

    A transaction that rolls back never fires: the row the event describes does
    not exist, so neither should the event.

    Args:
        session: The session whose commit the publish should follow.
