"""i18n API endpoints.

Serves the backend catalogue, backend/locales/*.json, to any HTTP consumer.

It does NOT serve this product's own UI, despite what the route names suggest.
The frontend builds its i18next store from bundled resources and lazy-loaded
locale chunks (frontend/src/app/i18n.ts, the ``resources: { en: enResource }``
init at line 264); there is no i18next-http-backend plugin, no ``loadPath``,
and nothing under frontend/src fetches these routes. So the two catalogues are
separate: roughly four hundred backend keys here, tens of thousands of UI keys
in frontend/src/app/locales/*.ts, and a key belongs to whichever side renders it.

That matters because reading this the other way invites someone to translate
the whole UI into these files to close a gap that does not exist. What the
backend catalogue is actually for is the strings the backend itself renders
through ``t()`` - validation messages, error text - plus any external client
that wants them.

Module translations are merged with core translations.

    A regional code counts as asking for its base language. Both routes here
    used to test membership of SUPPORTED_LOCALES directly, which holds base
    codes only, so pt-BR came back 404 while the Accept-Language middleware
    two files away was resolving the very same tag to pt without comment. The
    convention these routes are shaped for sends regional codes as a matter of
    course, so the 404 was answering a question nobody asked.

    This asks whether the platform claims the language, which is not the
    question ``_meta_for`` asks; that one asks whether a catalogue will really
    answer. The two are deliberately separate and today they agree on every
    code, because ``SUPPORTED_LOCALES`` is held equal to the files on disk by
    test_backend_locale_catalogue.py. If that ever stops being true, a code
    listed without a file is exactly the case the fallback flag exists for, and
    it has to reach the flag rather than be turned into a 404 here.
