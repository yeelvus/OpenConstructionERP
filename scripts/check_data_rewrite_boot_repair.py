"""Every migration that rewrites rows must say whether that rewrite reaches a real install.

Why this exists
---------------
This product does not run ``alembic upgrade``. The schema moves at boot through
``postgres_auto_migrate`` (ADD COLUMN / CREATE INDEX / ADD CONSTRAINT, plus one
DROP NOT NULL) and ``Base.metadata.create_all`` (whole missing tables). Neither
executes a revision's ``upgrade()`` body, and ``stamp_head_if_unstamped`` then
records the database at head. So a revision that backfills, renames or
de-duplicates rows never runs on an ordinary install, while every signal the
product has reports that it did.

``v3271_formwork_debrand`` is the case that made this concrete: it renames
trademarked catalogue rows, it had never executed on any install brought up the
normal way, and eleven months passed before anyone noticed - because there was
nothing to notice. The version table said head.

Sister script, different question
---------------------------------
``check_migration_data_rewrites.py`` asks how BIG a data rewrite is (issue #126,
a backfill that doubled peak disk on a 1724 MB table) and requires a
``# data-rewrite-ack:`` comment per table. This script reuses that script's scan
verbatim - same enumeration, same AST classifier, imported rather than
re-implemented, so the two cannot disagree about which revisions are flagged -
and asks the other question about the same set: does the rewrite REACH anybody.

The declaration
---------------
A flagged revision must carry at least one ``# boot-repair:`` comment. Four
forms, and the third and fourth are answers rather than escape hatches::

    # boot-repair: registry=<repair_id>
    # boot-repair: boot-path=<path>::<symbol>
    # boot-repair: none - <why no boot-path half is needed>
    # boot-repair: gap - <what does not reach an ordinary install>

``registry`` names an id passed to ``register_data_repair()`` in an
app/**/repairs.py, whose core lives in
``backend/app/core/data_repairs.py``, which the boot path runs on every start.
The id is checked against that file.

``boot-path`` names a module-level function that already does this repair
somewhere on the boot sequence - two of them predate the registry and are
ordered against the schema heal, so they stay where they are. The file and the
symbol are both checked.

``none`` says no boot-path half is needed, and the reason has to say why: the
rewrite only touches rows the same revision created, the statement is dead, the
heal's own ``server_default`` already produces the same result, or the revision
itself records that leaving the rows alone is correct.

``gap`` says the rewrite does NOT reach an ordinary install and that this is
known. It is accepted, and every one is printed on every run with a count in the
summary. That list is the point: the failure this whole script exists for is a
gap nobody knew about, and a gap that is written down in the file and counted in
CI is a different thing from one that is not.

What it does not cover
----------------------
Statements the sister script cannot resolve to a table at all. Those are its
business, they have their own baseline there, and a second opinion from here
would only be a second way to be wrong about the same nine statements.

Exit codes: 0 clean, 1 a flagged revision has no valid declaration (or the scan
itself looks too small to trust).

    that two authors working at once cannot overwrite each other in a shared
    file. The gate follows the code.

    Parsed with ``ast`` rather than imported: importing a repairs module pulls
    in SQLAlchemy and ``app.database``, which builds an engine from the
    environment, so this gate would then need a configured database to answer a
    question about source text. ``tests/unit/test_data_repair_registry.py``
    asserts this reading and the live registry agree after discovery, so the
    shortcut cannot drift away from the thing it is reading.

    Only literal ids count. An id built at runtime would be invisible here and
    the gate would report a revision as undeclared, which is the safe direction
    to be wrong in: it fails loudly rather than passing blindly.

    The mapped value distinguishes three cases the caller has to treat
    differently. A non-empty string is a revision the registration claims, and
    it is checkable. An empty string is a repair with no revision behind it,
    which :class:`app.core.data_repairs.DataRepair` documents as a legal value,
    so it is not a defect. ``None`` means the revision was not a literal and
    this reading cannot see it, which is not a defect either: an unreadable
    declaration must not be reported as a broken one.
