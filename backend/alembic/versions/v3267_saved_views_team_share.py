"""saved_views: share a view with a team, and constrain the enum columns.

Sharing a saved view was all-or-nothing: private, the whole project, or the
whole workspace. There was no way to hand a view to the five people who
actually work on that package. ``oe_teams`` now owns team membership, so a
share can name a team.

Adds to ``oe_saved_views_view``:

* ``shared_team_id`` - nullable foreign key into ``oe_teams_team``, ``ON DELETE
                       SET NULL``. Deleting a team revokes the share rather
                       than deleting other people's saved views; the view then
                       degrades to owner-only, which the module's validation
                       rules report as a finding instead of silently widening
                       it to the project.

Adds three CHECK constraints that encode rules the application already relies
on but the database never enforced:

* ``ck_oe_saved_views_view_share_scope``      - the four known scopes
* ``ck_oe_saved_views_view_team_pin_scope``   - a team pin only on a team share.
                                                Deliberately NOT the reverse:
                                                the SET NULL above must stay
                                                legal.
* ``ck_oe_saved_views_run_outcome``           - the five run outcomes

These are the names ``Base.metadata`` would give them, so an install built by
``create_all`` and one built by this migration carry the same constraint under
the same name and a later migration can drop it by name on either route.

Idempotent: every step is guarded by the inspector, so a fresh install that ran
``Base.metadata.create_all`` first is a no-op here. Rows that would violate a
new constraint are normalised first, and both normalisations are
behaviour-preserving - an unrecognised share scope is already treated as
private by the visibility check, and an unrecognised run outcome is already
read as a failure.
