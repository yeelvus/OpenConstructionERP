"""``/vector/v3-status/`` answers about the store the ranker actually opens.

The endpoint assembled its answer from two different servers. The collection
NAME came from ``country_to_collection``, which is CWICR naming, but
``engine``, ``connected`` and the collection probe all came from the general
vector store. On a default install those are not the same place: the ranker
opens the embedded CWICR store while the general store resolves to
``http://localhost:6333``. So a catalogue that was installed and matching
perfectly well could be reported ``disconnected`` or ``missing``.

That is why the central test here does not mock a client and read back the
return value. Doing so proves the handler can format a payload, not that it
asked the right server. These tests set the two stores to DISAGREE - the
general one unreachable, the CWICR one holding the collection - and assert
the answer follows the CWICR one. Under the old code the general store's
verdict arrived first and the handler returned before ever looking at the
collection, so every one of them fails.

The second defect was a confident answer produced without looking: when
``get_collection`` raised, the handler set the band to ``ready``. "Could not
read it" was reported with the one word that means "go ahead". There is now a
third outcome, ``unreadable``, distinct from both ``missing`` and ``ready``,
and it carries a reason.
