"""Owner-scoped permissions are only safe next to an owner check.

The module has permissions that map to EDITOR on the assumption that every
route carrying them also calls a ``_verify_owner_via_*`` helper. Without that
helper, EDITOR-level RBAC is an open door: anyone with EDITOR can hit the
endpoint and there is nothing else stopping them. The ownership check IS the
security gate; the low RBAC level just makes sure the project owner can
actually reach it.

This test enforces the pairing at the source level (AST walk) so that a
route that picks up an owner-scoped permission without calling a helper is
caught before it ships. A missing call has no observable behaviour until
somebody actually exploits it.

Originally this covered only ``owner_scoped_delete``. After the R6/R8 dead-
route fix it covers every permission whose safety depends on ownership.
