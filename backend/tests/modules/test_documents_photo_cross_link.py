"""The photo cross-link must not take the upload down with it.

Uploading a site photo writes two rows: the photo itself, and a ``Document`` row
so the photo also shows up in the documents hub. The second one is convenience
work, and the comment above it has always said a failure there is non-fatal.

Saying so takes more than an ``except``. A failed ``flush()`` marks the whole
session for rollback, and on PostgreSQL the transaction goes to aborted
server-side at the same moment, so catching the error and carrying on leaves
every later statement raising about a transaction that cannot continue. The
upload then dies several frames away, describing something other than what went
wrong, and the photo the user just uploaded is gone. This product has paid for
that class of bug before, most visibly when deadline notifications went dark
across the product because one bad row poisoned a session that a caught
exception could not revive.

``PhotoService.upload_photo`` therefore runs the cross-link inside
``session.begin_nested()``, and these tests are about that SAVEPOINT rather than
about the ``except``. "No exception escaped" cannot tell the two apart: it is
true whether the guard is present or missing. What separates them is what the
session can still do afterwards, so that is what is asserted here.

Remove the ``async with self.session.begin_nested():`` line from
``upload_photo`` and ``test_a_failed_cross_link_leaves_the_session_usable``
fails with ``PendingRollbackError``, which is the whole reason it exists.

The failure is injected by pointing the cross-link row at a project that does
not exist. ``Document.project_id`` carries a foreign key, so the flush fails the
way a database really fails, with an ``IntegrityError`` raised by PostgreSQL and
the transaction aborted server-side too. Nothing else about the upload changes;
the photo row still names the real project.

The upload also registers a version-chain row two lines BEFORE the cross-link,
and that call had no savepoint of its own. A failure there poisoned the session
first, so the cross-link below could no longer open its savepoint at all and
the guard the tests above certify was disarmed by the line above it - a test
that passes while the property it describes is false. The last three tests are
about that ordering, which is why one of them makes the registration fail and
then asserts that the cross-link still worked.
