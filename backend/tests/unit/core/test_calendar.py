"""Tests for the working-days calendar engine's multi-year holiday computation.

These exercise the three holiday families that used to be single-year (2026)
stubs and are now computed for any year:

* Hijri (Islamic) holidays - Eid al-Fitr / Eid al-Adha via ``hijridate``.
* Japanese equinoxes - the standard integer approximation (1980-2099).
* Hindu holidays - Diwali / Holi from a curated multi-year lookup table.

Assertions cover 2026, 2027 and 2028 so a regression to a fixed-year stub
would fail immediately, plus graceful behaviour for years outside the curated
Hindu table.
