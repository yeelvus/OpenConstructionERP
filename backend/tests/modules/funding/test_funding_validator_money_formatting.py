"""What the funding messages write as money, and what they must never.

Two of this module's amounts already go through ``_fmt_money``. The three
figures beside them are **rates**, and their templates glue the word
``percent`` straight onto the slot: "an own contribution of {rate} percent".
A currency code there would read "25 EUR percent", which is why the sweep that
converted the amounts had to stop at them.

That makes these the pins rather than the fixes. They are written with
four-digit values on purpose: a pin on ``5`` cannot tell a later conversion
from a no-op, while a pin on ``1234`` catches both the thousands separator and
the added decimals the conversion would bring.
