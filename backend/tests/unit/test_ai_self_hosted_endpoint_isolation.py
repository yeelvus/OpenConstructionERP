"""One user's self-hosted AI endpoint is one user's.

Reported as GHSA-wfpw-cv5v-64j5. Saving an Ollama or vLLM base URL wrote it
into a module-global provider table, so the endpoint belonged to the worker
process rather than to the person who saved it. Everyone whose next AI call
routed to a self-hosted runtime - a different user, a different tenant, the
administrator - sent their prompt, and whatever project text was in it, to the
host the last person to touch their own settings had named. Nothing in the
request path noticed, because by then the URL looked exactly like
configuration.

Only Ollama and vLLM were ever tunable, which is the whole reachable surface:
every other provider is a fixed vendor URL. The dispatch-time SSRF guard is
not a mitigation here either - it blocks link-local and cloud-metadata
addresses, and an ordinary public host is precisely what it lets through.

What is pinned:

* resolving one user's settings does not change what a second resolution
  dispatches to, which is the cross-user claim itself;
* an explicit ``base_url`` argument still wins, because the connection test
  endpoint sends one before anything is saved;
* settings that name no endpoint clear a previous binding rather than
  inheriting it, so a loop over users inside one task cannot carry the first
  user's host into the rest;
* the URL still gains the chat-completions path when the user saved the
  runtime root, which is the shape people actually save.

Reads the resolved endpoint the way the dispatch does, without a network:
``_post_openai_compat`` is called with a stubbed transport and the URL it was
about to POST to is captured.
