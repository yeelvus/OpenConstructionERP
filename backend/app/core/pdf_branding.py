# DDC-CWICR-OE: DataDrivenConstruction - OpenConstructionERP
# Copyright (c) 2026 Artem Boiko / DataDrivenConstruction
"""Shared company branding for every reportlab-generated PDF (issue #284).

Every PDF generator in the platform used to hard-code the literal
``"OpenConstructionERP"`` brand string, the ``#1a1a2e`` accent and the
author / creator document metadata. A workspace that white-labels the app
(see :mod:`app.core.app_branding` - the persisted logo / company name set by
the admin) therefore still printed the default brand on every exported
estimate, diary and invoice, which defeated the customisation (issue #284
follow-up to #272).

This module is the one place that turns the persisted branding into PDF
output, so wiring a generator is a 3-8 line swap rather than a copy of the
header / footer / metadata logic into each module:

* :func:`branded_header_footer` - an ``onPage(canvas, doc)`` callback that
  draws the workspace brand (the uploaded logo rasterised from its base64
  data URL, else the company name, else the default text) in the page header
  and a ``Generated ...`` line plus a page number in the footer. Geometry is
  read from the live ``doc`` (pagesize / margins) so it preserves whatever
  layout the calling generator already uses.
* :func:`branded_cover_brand` - the brand string for a cover-page title
  (logo cover art is out of scope for this MVP; the cover shows the name).
* :func:`branded_doc_metadata` - the ``author`` / ``creator`` / ``subject`` /
  ``producer`` / ``keywords`` to stamp on the ``DocTemplate`` so the file's
  document properties also carry the workspace brand.
* :func:`branded_letterhead` - the firm's formal letterhead (logo, registered
  name, address, registration line, contact line) as a flowable for the top of
  page one, built from :mod:`app.core.company_profile`. ``None`` when the
  profile is empty or the appearance turns it off, so a generator can insert
  it unconditionally.
* :func:`branded_footer` - the footer half of :func:`branded_header_footer`,
  for a page whose header is a letterhead.

**Which logo.** The company profile carries a *document* logo, the formal one a
firm's letters go out under, separate from the app logo in the sidebar (which
is often a cropped or simplified mark). Wherever this module draws a logo it
prefers the document logo and falls back to the app logo, and a document logo
that cannot be decoded falls back too rather than leaving the header empty. A
workspace with no document logo therefore sees exactly what it saw before.
Formal logos often arrive as SVG, which reportlab cannot read, so an SVG logo
is rasterised through PyMuPDF (a base dependency) before it is drawn.

Everything degrades gracefully and NEVER raises (mirrors the never-break
contract of :mod:`app.core.pdf_stamp`): a logo that fails to decode falls
back to the company name, an empty company name falls back to the default
brand, and any failure reading the persisted branding falls back to the
default too. A failed brand draw must never break a PDF export.

Deferred follow-up (out of scope for this MVP, by design): a configurable
template engine - per-workspace margins / fonts / colours / header layout /
footer text - and rendering the logo as cover-page art. Today the accent
colour and geometry stay the platform defaults; only the brand identity
(logo / name) and document metadata follow the workspace.

    page size and margin, and the body size and accent colour.

    The margin is widened where it would run the body into the header band
    (17 mm from the top edge) or the footer (10 mm from the bottom), which a
    narrow saved margin otherwise does.

    With ``doc_type`` the sample is drawn with that type's override laid over

      ``accent_color``, which would have moved the preview of a workspace with
      no letterhead while its documents stayed put;
    * the title keeps the platform colour, because a generator's accent colour
      reaches only the company name in its letterhead;
    * the footer is drawn only for a type that prints one (the fields list
      says so), and is the shared footer, not the RFI's own translated one;
    * the page is the type's own sheet
      (:class:`app.core.pdf_appearance.DocumentSheet`): its paper, orientation,
      margins and frame padding, so the letterhead lands where the document
      puts it. The workspace page size and margin apply to neither.

    Args:
        doc_type: A key of :data:`app.core.pdf_appearance.DOCUMENT_TYPES`, or
            ``None`` for the workspace look alone.
        paper: ``(width, height)`` in points of the reader's paper preference,
