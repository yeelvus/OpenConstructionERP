"""Contracts validation rules.

Ships five first-class rules registered with the platform rule registry under
the ``contracts`` rule set, of which the first three are:

* ``ContractPartyRolesRule`` (ERROR) - a contract must name the two parties
  that execute it.
* ``ContractPerformanceBondRule`` (WARNING) - a contract whose terms require a
  performance bond should have an active security row of that type.
* ``EOTDaysRule`` (ERROR) - a decided extension-of-time claim must never grant
  more days than were claimed.

The rules run against a plain dict context (no ORM), shaped by the service /
caller as::

    {
        "contract": {"id", "status", "contract_type", "terms": {...}},
        "parties": [{"party_role", "party_type", "display_name", ...}],
        "securities": [{"security_type", "status", ...}],
        "eot_claims": [{"eot_number", "days_claimed", "days_granted", "status"}],
    }

``display_name`` is the name the party would appear under on a signature
block, which is not always the stored one: a party entered as a link to a
contact, a subcontractor or a user carries no stored name at all. The service
resolves that before it builds the context, so a rule reading the field never
has to know which of the two it got.

Keeping the rules pure and dict-driven makes them trivially unit-testable and
satisfies the platform "no module without validation rules" requirement.

A second rule set, ``pay_application``, checks one progress claim as the
payment application it becomes. It runs when a claim is submitted (errors
block) and on ``GET /progress-claims/{id}/validation``, over a context the
service builds in ``ContractsService.claim_rule_context``::

    {
        "claim": {"id", "number", "status", "period_start", "period_end",
                  "claim_date", "period_from", "period_to", "application_date"},
        "previous_claim": {"id", "number", "period_from", "period_to"} | None,
        "lines": [{"contract_line_id", "code", "description", "scheduled_value",
                   "total_completed_stored", ...}],
        "percent_regressed": [{"contract_line_id", "code", "observed_pct",
                               "requested_value", "previous_value"}],
        "currency": "USD",
        "as_of": "2026-03-31" | None,
        "retention": {"held", "expected_held", "accrual", "expected_accrual",
                      "accrued_to_date", "released_to_date"} | None,
        "<key>": ...,   # one entry per provider in contracts.claim_context
    }

``retention`` is None on a claim whose retention the engine has not worked
out, so the two retention rules have nothing to compare there.

A third rule set, ``retention_release``, gates the approval of a retention
release (``ContractsService.approve_retention_release``)::

    {
        "release": {"id", "event", "status", "amount"},
        "currency": "USD",
        "available": "7500.00",   # free to release, this release included
        "required_documents": ["certificate_substantial_completion", ...],
        "documents": [{"id", "doc_role", "title"}],   # attached to the release
    }

Dates arrive as ISO strings and amounts as decimal strings, so the context is
plain data. ``as_of`` is the claim's period end: "the clock is data", so a
check about what was valid at the end of the period gives the same answer when
it is re-run a year later. The findings are worded through the module's own
message bundle in the caller's language. Keys past the core ones come from
other modules through :mod:`app.modules.contracts.claim_context`; with none
registered they are absent, and rules that read one treat absence as "nothing
to check".

    """A contract must name the two parties that execute it.

    Two *distinct signing roles*, each carrying a name - not a named employer
    and a named contractor. Which two roles sign depends on the contract: a
    main contract runs employer to contractor, a subcontract runs contractor to
    subcontractor, and the same firm is the buying side of one and the selling
    side of the other. An earlier version of this rule asked for an employer
    and a contractor by name, which is true of a main contract and false of
    every subcontract in the register - the employer is not a party to those
    and deliberately does not appear on them. That rule reported the whole
    subcontract register as incomplete for a party it should never have.

    Distinct roles rather than two rows, because the signature block takes one
    party per role. Two contractor rows and nobody else produce a single
    signatory, which is a contract with itself.

    Applies at every status, including ``draft``. An earlier version applied
    only to a signed contract, on the reasoning that a draft may still be
    assembling its register - but the moment the register has to be complete
    is the moment somebody puts the contract up for signature, and that only
    ever happens on a draft. So the rule that checked the party register could
    never fire while there was still something a person could do about it, and
    the check that actually stopped the press was a hardcoded refusal in the
    service with no rule id, no suggestion and no way to see it coming.

    Reporting an incomplete register on a brand-new draft is not noise: the
    panel this feeds is a completeness traffic light, "incomplete" is the true
    answer for a contract with nobody on it, and the finding carries the
    suggestion that fixes it. Nothing blocks on the finding except the signing
    gate, which is exactly the moment it should.

    The header carries the money: gross, retention and net are what the
    invoice is raised from and what every later claim reads as previously
    certified. They were written by the generator alone, so a line written
    by hand moved the continuation sheet and left the certificate asking for
    the old figure. Both are now written together, and this says so out loud
    for any row that predates the fix or was changed by a path nobody
    remembered.

    A claim with no lines behind it is not checked: cost-plus and time and
    materials bill actual cost, and there is nothing here to add up.

    What the equality means depends on what the gross is made of, and the
    claim now records that rather than leaving it to be guessed from the
    presence of lines. A claim made of lines, which is every claim that does
    not say otherwise and every claim written before the basis was recorded,
    must equal them exactly. A claim billed off recorded cost may carry lines
    as a partial breakdown of a gross that did not come from them, so it is
    held to the weaker statement that the breakdown cannot exceed the money.

    The weaker half still blocks, and it is not decoration. A gross below its
    own lines is a contradiction in the claim's money: the continuation sheet
    draws its columns from the lines while the header asks for less than they
    add up to, so line 4 and net due stop agreeing and the certificate goes
    out saying two things. It is reported rather than corrected upward,
    because correcting it would be the same re-read of the gross from the
    lines that the basis exists to stop, arriving under a different name.
