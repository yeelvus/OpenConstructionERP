"""Notification subscriber for Project Discussion comments (issue #279).

Pre-#279 the collaboration module's ``create_comment`` published no event,
so a new comment on a discussion thread was invisible to everyone except
whoever happened to reload the thread. This subscriber listens for the
detached ``collaboration.comment.created`` event and notifies the OTHER
participants of the thread / project (never the author).

Recipient resolution (bounded and fail-safe):

    * every distinct prior commenter on the same entity (the people already
      taking part in the discussion), plus
    * the owning project's owner (so the project lead always sees activity),

    minus the comment author (nobody is notified about their own comment).

Because the integrations connector bridge (also issue #279) subscribes to
``notifications.notification.created``, these notifications automatically
reach Telegram / Slack / Teams / Discord / WhatsApp for any recipient who
connected a chat connector.

Conventions match the other notification subscribers:
    1. Pull the hints out of ``event.data``; skip silently if the required
       ones are missing - the subscriber must never break a successful
       upstream comment insert.
    2. Open a short-lived isolated session via ``async_session_factory()``.
    3. Catch all exceptions and log at debug.
