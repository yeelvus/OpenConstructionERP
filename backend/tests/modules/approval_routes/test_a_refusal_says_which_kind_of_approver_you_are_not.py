"""The three ways this module refuses a decision each say something different.

``submit_decision`` answers 403 from two places and with three sentences,
because the first of them chooses between two of those sentences on whether
the instance currently names a stand-in:

    Not the assigned approver for this step
    Not the named approver for this step
    Caller role does not satisfy the approver role for this step

Only the status code was ever asserted, and a status code cannot tell those
apart. The distinction is the whole value of the message. "Named" means the
route itself picked somebody else, so the reader's answer is to ask the route
author. "Assigned" means the step was handed to a stand-in, so the reader's
answer is to ask the person holding it, and the person who used to be able to
decide is one of the people who will now read this. Swapping the two arms of
that conditional sends every reader to the wrong place, and the suite would
have stayed green, because both arms are 403.

The third sentence is not a variant of the other two. It comes from the
role-based branch, which is only reached when no user is entitled at all, and
it exists so somebody holding the decide permission cannot clear a gate the
route pinned to a higher role. A test that only exercised the pinned cases
would leave the branch that separates permission from role uncovered.

These are asserted as whole strings rather than by substring. "Not the" would
pass for either of the first two, which is exactly the confusion being
guarded against.
