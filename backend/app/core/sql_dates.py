"""Dialect-aware date arithmetic for SQL expressions.

PostgreSQL subtracts one ``DATE`` from another and gives whole days as an
integer. SQLite has no date type at all - a ``Date`` column is stored as the
text ``YYYY-MM-DD`` - so the same question has to be asked through
``julianday``. The two spellings are not interchangeable, and writing either
one directly at a call site makes that call site work on one backend only.

``days_since(column)`` centralises the one form the platform needs: how many
whole days have passed since a stored date. It is the shape an aging question
takes when the answer has to stay correct in a definition somebody saved months
ago - "older than 90 days" keeps meaning what it said, where "before
2026-06-01" quietly stops being the question that was asked.

``NULL`` stays ``NULL`` on both backends, which matters more here than it looks:
an unrecorded date is not a fresh one, and a caller that reads an absent price
date as zero days old would report the stalest rows as the safest.
