"""What the Variance column on a budget line is allowed to mean.

Variance used to be ``revised_budget - actual``, which is spend to date
measured against the budget. On a job that is half built that quantity is
positive on every line by construction, so the column a cost report exists to
show an overrun in was green on all of them and could not go red until the
money had already gone. These tests pin the reading that can: the revised
budget against the outturn the line is forecast to reach.
