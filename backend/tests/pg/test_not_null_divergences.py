"""Does this database still match the models, and can anything say so.

``not_null_divergences`` answers the standing question. The heal's own warning
answers a different one - what this boot decided - and goes quiet on every boot
afterwards, so on an install that upgraded on an earlier release it says
nothing while the divergence is still there. The last test here is the one that
ties the two halves together: it drives the real heal into its silent path and
then asks the standing check what the database looks like afterwards.

The controls carry most of the weight. A check that reported every nullable
column, or every NOT NULL one, would satisfy the positive test and be useless.
One of them pins a limit rather than a success: the inverse divergence, where
the models allow NULL and the database refuses it, is real and is NOT reported
here, because it is a different fault with a different repair.
