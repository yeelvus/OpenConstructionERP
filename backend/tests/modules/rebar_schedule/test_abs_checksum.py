"""The ABS checksum rule.

The checksum is the only self-verifying part of the format, which makes it the
oracle for everything else: a record that reproduces its own checksum has been
written correctly, and a codec that reproduces the checksum for a record it
built has laid the characters out the way the standard asks.
