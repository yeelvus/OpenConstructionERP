"""A pack that sells a country must price with that country's method.

The platform already knows how to price a bill nationally. ``markup_templates``
states the national markup stacks, ``REGION_BY_COUNTRY`` says which country
reads which stack, and the methodology catalogue rewrites a flat country
template from that stack so a country cannot be priced two ways by two engines.
That machinery works. What nothing checked is whether a pack that sells a
country actually asks for it.

Two packs did not. ``brazil-sinapi`` shipped the SINAPI cost base and the NBR
rule sets and left ``default_methodology`` empty, and ``saudi-vision2030``
shipped the Saudi Building Code and the Aramco approval stack and did the same.
An empty field is not an absent one: the manifest documents it as "keeps the
platform flat international default", so both packs priced their bills with a
method belonging to no market while advertising a national one all around it.
The Brazilian and Saudi templates existed the whole time and were derived from
the BR and GULF stacks; nothing was naming them.

That defect is invisible from every side. The pack applies cleanly, the plan in
``partner_pack.apply`` reports no warning because there is no unknown slug to
warn about, the project is created, and the bill is priced. A reader comparing
the pack against the catalogue would have to already suspect the field to look
at it.

Why the check is shaped in two tiers. The strict tier fires only where a
national method demonstrably exists, which is the one condition that makes
silence about a national method wrong. The markup table's own header is
explicit that a country's absence from ``REGION_BY_COUNTRY`` is the honest
answer that we ship the neutral international method for that market, so
demanding a NATIONAL method from every pack would convict packs for telling
the truth and would be red from birth.

The second tier exists because the first one let three packs through while
they were doing something plainly wrong. Canada, New Zealand and South Africa
have no national stack, so nothing above could fire on them, and all three
shipped no methodology at all. That is not the same as having no national
convention to name: the catalogue has a template for each of those countries,
carrying the right currency and the right consumption-tax rate and saying of
itself that it is the neutral method rather than a national convention. Naming
it is strictly better than the flat international default, which carries
neither. So the weaker tier asks only this: a pack that sells a country the
catalogue has any template for must name that template. It upgrades itself for
free, because the moment the markup table states that country's stack the
template is rewritten from it and the pack is already pointing at the result.

Between them the tiers cover every pack in the tree that names a market. What
neither fires on is a pack that names no country at all, which is the sector
packs and the one industry pack, correctly.

The population is printed beside the verdict on purpose. A gate over pack
manifests that silently found none would pass, and this is a file that could
easily find none: it reads the source tree, and an installed layout has the
manifests somewhere else entirely.
