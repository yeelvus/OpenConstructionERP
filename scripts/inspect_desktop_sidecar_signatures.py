"""Report the code signature of every Mach-O the onefile sidecar carries inside itself.

Why this exists
---------------
The 14.4.0 desktop build failed to start on macOS with

    code signature in '.../_MEIxxxx/Python.framework/Versions/3.12/Python' not valid
    for use in process: mapping process and mapped file (non-platform) have different
    Team IDs

The onefile bootloader unpacks its archive at launch and dyld then maps those files into
the running process. So the property that decides whether the app starts is not the
signature on the executable a reader sees, it is the signature on the members sealed
inside it. Signing the wrapper says nothing about them, and running the binary on a
build machine says nothing either: enforcement of Team ID matching depends on the
policy applied to the process, and a locally built, never quarantined binary is judged
more leniently than the same file after a user downloads it.

This script reads the archive of the executable that will actually be shipped and prints
what each Mach-O member is signed with. A member carrying a real Team ID while the
process carries none is the exact mismatch dyld refuses, whether or not this machine
happens to enforce it today.

What it measured, and how far that reaches
------------------------------------------
Not the cause of the 14.4.0 failure. The 14.4.0 sidecar was read alongside two later
builds that differ only in the spec's codesign_identity line, and all three came back the
same: 402 Mach-O members, every one ad-hoc with no Team ID. PyInstaller rewrites rpaths
in the binaries it collects, which invalidates their original signatures, and re-signs
them ad-hoc on its own, so that result is what one would expect.

That result was then read more widely than it can carry, and this file was part of why.
The count covers only members this script could open and whose signature it could parse.
A member the reader failed to extract used to drop out of the total silently, and a
member whose codesign output did not yield a TeamIdentifier line was filed under "no Team
ID" rather than "could not tell". Either one would remove a framework binary from the
census without leaving a mark - and a framework binary is precisely what the failure
names. So "402, all ad-hoc" supported "every member we opened is ad-hoc", not "every
member is". Both gaps are now reported, both fail the gate, and --require-member makes a
run fail unless a named member was genuinely inspected.

Whether the shipped archive is clean is therefore still open. What is settled is that the
spec's codesign_identity line does not change this property either way.

That leaves this script as a tripwire rather than a fix: it fails the build the day a
dependency or a packer upgrade starts sealing a vendor-signed binary inside the archive,
which would introduce that failure for real.

Both directions of the mismatch count
-------------------------------------
dyld does not ask whether a mapped file carries a Team ID, it asks whether the file's Team
ID is the process's. So the property this script checks is agreement with the wrapper, and
disagreement has two shapes. The one the 14.4.0 report named is a wrapper with no Team ID
and a member with one. The other is a wrapper with a real Team ID and members without one,
which is what any later signing pass over the finished executable would produce, because
PyInstaller re-signs the members it collects ad-hoc and nothing downstream re-signs them
again: they are sealed inside the file by then, not files on disk. That second shape used
to pass here, and worse, it printed "no member carries a Team ID, so no member can
disagree with the process about one" on its way out. It now fails like the first.

The same file is therefore worth reading at more than one point in a build. Anything that
signs the executable after it was measured changes the value every member is compared
against without touching a single member, so a reading taken before that step says nothing
about the artifact that ships.

Usage:
    python scripts/inspect_desktop_sidecar_signatures.py desktop/dist/openconstructionerp-server

The path may be the raw PyInstaller output or the same binary sitting inside a bundle, for
example OpenConstructionERP.app/Contents/MacOS/openconstructionerp-server. Nothing here
treats a bundle specially: the member census reads the archive appended to the file, and
codesign reports the file's own signature, both of which are the same questions wherever
the file lives.

Exit codes
----------
    0   the archive was read and there is a verdict. Either nothing disagrees with the
        wrapper, or --fail-on-foreign-team-id was not passed and this ran as plain
        evidence without deciding anything by itself.
    1   the archive was read and the answer is bad: a member disagrees with the wrapper,
        the census was too narrow to support a claim about the whole archive, a
        --require-member name was never opened, or the path given is not a file.
    2   nothing was read and there is no verdict of any kind. This is not macOS, so there
        is no codesign to ask, or PyInstaller is not importable, so the archive cannot be
        opened. Never 0.

The line between 1 and 2 is what this file exists to hold, and it is not decided by any
flag: --fail-on-foreign-team-id turns the gate on, and a flag that turns a gate on cannot
also be what decides whether an unmeasured run looks measured. "I could not look" reported
as 0 is a success message about zero objects, and the step summary downstream turns it
into the word "clean". 2 is unreachable by any run that opened the archive, so a
misconfigured runner cannot produce a green one.
