// Cases - the specialist's photograph on a case tile, and the one place the
// country-variant fallback happens.
//
// `caseFaceFor` decides which portrait to ask for by reading the generated
// manifest of country art (see the header of caseFaces.ts), so `face.src`
// names a file that was on disk when the commit was made. This component is
// the second line, not the first: a deploy can ship the manifest without the
// webp beside it, a webp can be pulled after the fact, and a proxy can serve a
// 200 with the wrong bytes. When the request fails for any of those reasons
// the pooled portrait goes in on the error event, so the reader sees the
// picture the case wore before any market had one rather than an empty tile or
// a broken-image glyph.
//
// The photograph is decorative on every surface: `alt=""` maps the <img> out
// of the accessibility tree, and the role and the market are both stated in
// words on the same tile. The `aria-hidden="true"` that the constellation cell
// used to carry alongside its own `alt=""` is not reproduced here. It changed
// nothing - an empty alt already removes the element - and reinstating it on
// one of five call sites would read as though the other four were different.
//
// The five places a face is shown - the Cases hub card, the case page hero
// column and its catalogue band, the constellation cell on the case page, and
// the dashboard gallery - all come through here. That is five <img> sites in
// four files; PlaybookRunner holds two of them. The dashboard forces the
// shared component: its <img> is rendered inside a `.map()` in the parent's
// body, where a per-tile `useState` is not something you can write. One
// component is the answer for the other four too, since a fallback that four
// of five surfaces implement is a fallback one surface is missing.

 * the browser's own placeholder, which is the behaviour these tiles always
