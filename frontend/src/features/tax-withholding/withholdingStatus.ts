 *
 * `days_to_expiry` is the field to be careful with. The server computes it as
 * `(valid_to - as_of).days`, so it is **negative** once the window has closed
 * and **null** only for a standing with no end date at all. Zero means the
 * window closes today, which is a real answer and not a missing one — treating
 * it as falsy files "expires today" under "never expires".
 *
 * Dates are compared as ISO strings: they arrive as `YYYY-MM-DD`, which sorts
