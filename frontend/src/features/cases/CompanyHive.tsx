// CompanyHive - the kinds of company a case is written for, as a honeycomb.
//
// The case page already draws its modules as a comb (ModuleHive.tsx). This is
// the other half of the same question: a case has a REACH across the product,
// and it has an AUDIENCE. Both are short lists the reader should be able to
// take in at a glance, so both are the same drawing. `Hive` is shared verbatim;
// only the cargo differs, which is why there is no second layout here to drift
// from the first one.
//
// THREE DIFFERENCES FROM THE MODULE COMB, all of them in the data:
//
//   TINT IS PER CELL. A case's modules share the case's discipline colour,
//   because they are that one case's route through the product. Company types
//   are not the case's property - they exist across the whole catalogue and
//   each carries its own colour on the hub's "I work as..." selector. A comb
//   that repainted them in the case's discipline would be inventing a
//   relationship the palette elsewhere denies.
//
//   THE CELLS CARRY PHOTOGRAPHS. There is a company scene on disk for each of
//   these (caseFaces.ts), the same picture the hub's selector uses, so the
//   cell can be the firm rather than a glyph standing in for it. It is washed
//   back behind the glyph and the name: decorative, and out of the accessible
//   tree, because the label is what a reader has to be able to act on.
//
//   THE CELLS ARE BIGGER. Four company names are a smaller band than a dozen
//   module names, and at module size a band of three read as an unfinished
//   comb rather than a small complete one. The count problem is answered by
//   the size of the cells, not by padding the comb out with cells for company
//   types the case was not written for - a hexagon nobody can act on reads as
//   disabled, and five of those beside three live ones is a worse answer than
//   three alone. The denominator is a fact and it is in the caption, in words.

   * `aside` is the narrow column beside the process strip. Three things have
   * to change together for that, and changing any one of them alone looks
   * broken. The caption goes ABOVE the cells, because 144px of the column
   * spent on a caption is width the comb needs. The cells come down from 136
   * to 96, so the widest comb in the catalogue still fits the column without
   * a scroller of its own (the arithmetic is at `cellWidth` below). And the
   * box takes the column's width rather than hugging its content, so the two
   * columns are one height instead of two ragged ones.

 * same store, so the hub comes up already answering "what else is here for a
 * firm like mine". Renders nothing for a case that names no company type,
 * the same as the module comb does for a case that reaches no module.

  // column it has to fit inside is `lg:w-96` minus `p-4` on both sides, and
  // `w-96` is 360px here rather than the nominal 384: this app's root font is
  // 15px, so every rem-based Tailwind width is 15/16 of the number in its
  // name. That leaves 328px, and 96 is the cell that fits four of them into
  // it (312) while staying at or above the 96 where `Hive` switches the name
  // back up to `text-xs`. At 136 the same comb is 442px and would sit in a
  // horizontal scroller inside a page that already has one.
  //
  // One number per render, not per breakpoint: the band is laid out in baked
  // pixels, so a cell cannot be 136 on a phone and 96 in the column without
