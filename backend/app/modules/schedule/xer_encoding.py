"""Decode a P6 XER schedule export whose code page the file never declares.

An ``.xer`` is written in the Windows ANSI code page of the machine that
exported it and says so nowhere. The route used to try UTF-8 and then fall back
to Latin-1, which is the worst possible second guess, because Latin-1 accepts
every byte there is. An export from an Arabic, Russian, Greek or Hebrew Windows
install therefore imported without an error, without a warning and without a log
line, and every activity, WBS and resource name reached the database as
mojibake. Nothing downstream can recover it: by then the original bytes are
gone.

Latin-1 was also the wrong first guess for the Western files it was meant for.
P6's Western default is cp1252, whose 0x80 to 0x9F range holds the curly quotes,
the en dash and the euro sign. Latin-1 maps that range to C1 control characters,
so ``Crane Operator 'Day Shift'`` imported with invisible control bytes inside
the name.

The ladder here is utf-8-sig, then strict utf-8, then a sniffed code page, then
cp1252, then Latin-1 as the floor that cannot fail. Every step but the last can
decline, which is what makes the order meaningful.

How the sniff decides, and why it is not the obvious thing
---------------------------------------------------------

The obvious test is "decode the high bytes and see whether they came out as that
code page's own script". Measured against real bytes, that test does not
discriminate poorly, it does not discriminate at all: cp1251 maps every byte
from 0xC0 to 0xFF onto a Cyrillic letter, so Arabic text scores a perfect 1.00
as Cyrillic, and Greek and Hebrew samples score 1.00 under three of the four
candidates. The margin between the right answer and the best wrong one was
exactly zero on all four languages. Anything built on script membership is a
coin flip wearing a lab coat.

What does separate them is how often the six most frequent letters of a language
turn up. Under the right page they are about half of everything; under a wrong
one the same bytes land on letters that language rarely uses. Measured on
construction vocabulary in all four languages, the right page scored 0.49 to
0.53 and the best wrong page never passed 0.38, the narrowest gap being Hebrew
against Greek at 0.12. Six letters rather than the whole alphabet is the point:
a set large enough to cover most of a script saturates and stops telling the two
apart.

How little evidence is too little
---------------------------------

The scores above were calibrated on running text and none of them is aware of
how small a sample it may be dividing. A schedule is mostly ASCII, so a file
carrying one short activity name puts five or six high bytes on the table; every
score is then a multiple of 0.2 and a lead of 0.2 clears the margin without
meaning anything. Measured over 13039 name-shaped windows of the same
construction vocabulary, uncapped in length, the largest sample that still named
the wrong page carried 25 high bytes, and the failure was not evenly spread:
Hebrew lost 11 of its 33 whole-word names to Greek and Arabic. Raising the
margin instead was measured and rejected: it never reaches zero wrong answers at
any value, and by 0.12 it has started throwing away correct verdicts on whole
files, because Hebrew's own margin on a full export is 0.117.

The upper end of that gap is the part worth stating carefully, because the first
version of this floor got it wrong. It was set from the smallest whole export in
the test vocabulary, 60 high bytes, and placed at 32. But the smallest export a
person actually has is far smaller than the smallest one in a test fixture: a
two-row file with one WBS name and one activity name carries 31, and such a file
was declined by one byte and imported as mojibake, which is the whole defect this
module exists to fix. The gap that matters runs from 25, the largest measured
wrong answer, to 31, the smallest real file, and the floor sits in the middle of
it. Measured across the same 13039 windows, moving it from 32 to 28 changes the
wrong-answer count not at all, both are zero, and recovers 1198 correct verdicts
that 32 was throwing away.

Why Hebrew carries ten letters and the others six
-------------------------------------------------

The six-letter profiles are not equally informative, and Hebrew's was the worst
of the four by a wide margin. Two of its six most frequent letters occupy bytes
that are also Greek's most frequent: yod is 0xE9, which is iota, and vav is
0xE5, which is epsilon. Four more common Hebrew letters land on the remaining
Greek four, bet on alpha, final nun on omicron, final mem on nu and pe on tau.
So the Greek profile scored on Hebrew text with all six of its letters, and the
lead cp1255 held over cp1253 fell under the margin.

The population that shows this is not the one the earlier thresholds were
calibrated on, and that is the lesson worth keeping. A sweep of contiguous
windows cut from one running sentence converges, because a long window is nearly
the whole sentence. A real export carries a set of distinct short activity
names whose letter mix never converges. Measured over every three-to-six name
subset of ten real Hebrew activity names, 792 files, the shipped profile named
the right page for 62 percent of them, declined 35 percent, and named cp1253
outright for 23 of them at 44 to 61 high bytes, which is far above any floor.
Arabic, Russian and Greek were at 100 percent on the same population, so this
was Hebrew alone.

Extending every profile made it worse, not better, because Greek's own seventh
through twelfth letters land on common Hebrew ones in turn; at ten letters each
the wrong answers rose from 23 to 51. Extending only Hebrew works, because the
letters it gains, resh, mem, shin and nun, sit on Greek letters that are rare in
Greek: psi, xi, omega and pi. Twelve is too many, at which point Hebrew's own
profile starts claiming Greek text and Greek collapses to 13 percent. Ten is
where every one of the four reaches zero wrong answers, on this population and
on the window population both.

A Western file must never reach that scoring at all, and the guard is the shape
of the high bytes rather than their count. Accented Latin letters arrive alone
between ASCII, non-Latin scripts arrive in runs. Measured: the longest run in
``Straße``, ``Größe``, ``Façade`` and a line of curly quotes was two bytes, and
the share of high bytes sitting in runs of three or more was 0.00; for the four
non-Latin samples that share was 0.98 to 1.00, with runs up to twelve. The
threshold sits in the middle of a gap that wide, so it is not a tuned number.

What this deliberately does not do
----------------------------------

No confidence is reported to the caller and no free-text guess is made beyond
these four pages. A code page that is not here (Thai cp874, the East Asian
multi-byte pages, Turkish cp1254, which differs from cp1252 in six positions and
so cannot be told apart by shape) falls through to cp1252, exactly as before.
That is a smaller promise than a general charset detector and it is kept.
