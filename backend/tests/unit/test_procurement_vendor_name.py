"""The vendor label on a purchase order, for a contact with only an email.

``Contact`` has no ``email`` column - the column is ``primary_email`` - and the
same display-name rule was written out by hand in several places, two of which
ended their fallback chain on ``c.email``. That branch is reached only when a
contact has neither a company name nor a person name, which is exactly the
shape a vendor imported from a supplier list or created from an inbound invoice
arrives in. The purchase order list endpoint therefore raised AttributeError,
as a 500 over the whole page rather than one unnamed row, for any project with
such a vendor on any of its orders.

The test drives the endpoint rather than the helper underneath it, because the
helper was never the thing that was wrong: the rule it applied was written out
by hand at the call site, and a test of the hand-written copy would have agreed
with it. What follows asserts the label a buyer actually sees.
