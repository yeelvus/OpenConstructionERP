"""A regional locale reads its base language, not English.

The UI offers five regional codes and resolves every one of them through its
base language, so a Brazilian reader sees the Portuguese strings. The backend
catalogue has a file for none of the five, and it used to go straight from a
missing pt-BR to English. The same person then read Portuguese on screen and
English in everything the server writes, with the Portuguese string sitting in
memory the whole time.

The gap between the two layers is the thing under test here, so the assertions
below are written against both sides rather than against the backend alone.
