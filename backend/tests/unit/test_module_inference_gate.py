#
# Negative control for the inference-declaration gate.
#
# The gate reports how many modules reach a model without saying so. A count is a
# fact about the gate until it names what it found, so every test here asserts on
# the NAME of the module in the output rather than on the number or on the exit
# code. A gate that goes red for the wrong module is a gate that will be believed
# for the wrong reason.
#
# Nothing here writes into backend/app/modules. The gate takes an app directory
# so the fixture tree lives in tmp_path: the loader discovers modules by walking
# that directory, this tree is shared by many sessions at once, and an untracked
# directory planted there would break a build for everybody.
#
# The fixture tests narrow the primitive set to one root, so the fixture does not
# have to carry a stub of every model entry point in the platform. Only the last
# test scans the real tree, because that scan costs about a minute: it parses
# every file under backend/app, which is what makes it able to see an import that
# a name-based sweep cannot.
