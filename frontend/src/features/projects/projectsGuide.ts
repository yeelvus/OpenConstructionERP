// projectsGuide - "How it works" content for the Projects module.
//
// Co-located with the feature so the copy lives next to the screen it
// describes. Every key carries an inline English default and is consumed
// through t(key, { defaultValue }); the keys are not in en.ts, the inline
// defaults are the English source; their translations live in the other
// locale files, so a changed default needs its translations redone too. The sections explain the core concepts first, then walk the
// user through actually creating a project and filling in its key fields.
