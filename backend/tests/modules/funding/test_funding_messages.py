"""The funding findings say the same thing in every language the product offers.

A missing message does not raise. ``translate`` falls back to English and then
to the raw key, so a hole shows up as an English sentence inside a German
report, or as ``funding.own_share_is_covered.fail`` printed to a funding
officer. Neither is visible to any other gate we own, because there is no
value to compare against.

The findings used to live in the shared validation bundle, which answers four
languages, so a reader in any of the other thirty-four got English sentences
on an otherwise translated funding screen. They now live in the module's own
bundle, and these tests hold it to every language a request can resolve to.

The keys are read out of the rule source rather than listed here, so a rule
that starts emitting a sixth message is covered the day it is written instead
of the day somebody remembers to extend this file.
