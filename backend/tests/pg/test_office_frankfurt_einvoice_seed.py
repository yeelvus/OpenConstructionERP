"""A freshly seeded office-frankfurt invoice survives an XRechnung dry-run.

The German showcase preflight found the seeded invoices unusable for the
E-Rechnung walkthrough: every invoice carried ``contact_id`` NULL and no
Leitweg-ID, so the dry-run failed BR-7/BR-11 (buyer name and country),
BR-DE-8/9 (buyer city and post code) and BR-DE-15 (BT-10 buyer reference)
before a user had typed anything. The generator was fine; the seed was the
gap.

The seed now bills one receivable interim invoice to the client contact,
whose directory record answers the buyer's postal address and VAT id, and
stores the Leitweg-ID plus the seller party under ``metadata["einvoice"]``.
This test installs the demo into a real database and then walks exactly the
resolution path the export route walks (``einvoice_defaults_for_invoice``
into ``violations_for``), so what is asserted is the document a user would
actually get, not a hand-built lookalike.
