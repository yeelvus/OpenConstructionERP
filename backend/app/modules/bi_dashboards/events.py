"""BI Dashboards cross-module subscribers (Wave M4 deep-pass).

BI Dashboards is a *read-only* module - it consumes events from every
other module and feeds them into a lightweight projection layer. The
real per-KPI recompute happens lazily on the next dashboard render
(``service.compute_kpi``). What this module does at event time:

1. Touches the affected KPI's ``last_invalidated_at`` watermark so a
   subsequent ``compute_kpi(persist=True)`` knows the cached snapshot
   is stale.
2. Optionally evaluates alert rules whose ``kpi_code`` is in the
   ``kpi_codes`` payload.

All handlers are fail-soft. Subscribers are gated to PostgreSQL when
they need a writeable session - on SQLite the in-memory dev DB collapses
to a single writer and would deadlock.

# In-process map of project_id -> {invalidated_at, reason, source_event}. An
# upstream data change bumps the watermark for that project (and the global

# map is single-process (matching the in-process schedulers) and resets on
# restart, which the API reports via ``server_started_at`` so a client treats
# data as fresh-since-boot when no invalidation has happened yet.
