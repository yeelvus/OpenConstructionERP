/**
 * "How it works" guide content for the Dashboard module.
 *
 * Co-located with the feature. Consumed by <ModuleGuideButton content={dashboardGuide} />
 * rendered next to the Dashboard tour button in DashboardPage.tsx. Every key carries an
 * inline English defaultValue; the keys are not in en.ts, the inline defaults
 * are the English source; their translations live in the other locale files,
 * so a changed default needs its translations redone too.
 *
 * Key prefix: guide.dashboard.*
 * Spotlight selectors reuse the same data-testid hooks the Dashboard ProductTour uses.
