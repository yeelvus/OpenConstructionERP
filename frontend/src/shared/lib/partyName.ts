/**
 * Decide what a person column says, from the pair the API sends.
 *
 * Person columns across the product are free text, and three things
 * legitimately land in them: a name somebody typed, a contact id, and a user
 * id. Seeders and field integrations write ids, on-screen pickers write ids,
 * and a screen that prints the column as it stands shows
 * "3f2b8c1e-9a44-..." where a name belongs. The API resolves what it can and
 * sends a `<field>_name` beside the raw value; this module turns that pair
 * into the one of three things a reader can be told.
 *
 * The three states matter and must not be collapsed into two. An id that
 * resolved to nothing is NOT nobody: the record has an owner we merely cannot
 * name, and telling a site manager it is unassigned invites a second
 * assignment. Callers print the unresolved state as unknown, never as empty.
 *
 * This started inside the punch list, the one register somebody had thought
 * about, and every other screen printing the same kind of column had no rule
 * at all. A rule written once per caller is only ever tested at the caller
 * that was already right, so it lives here.
