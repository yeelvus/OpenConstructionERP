Tables:
    oe_certpay_determination  - a wage determination the contractor has on file
    oe_certpay_classification - one craft line inside a determination, carrying
                                the basic hourly rate and the fringe rate apart
    oe_certpay_assignment     - which classification a worker works under on a
                                project, over a validity window
    oe_certpay_week           - one week's certified payroll: the statement of
                                compliance, the signature and the fringe election
    oe_certpay_line           - the frozen, per-worker record of a certified week

Who owns what, and where the join is
====================================

``oe_payroll`` owns the pay run. ``oe_certified_payroll`` owns the compliance
record. They are joined, not parallel, and neither is a copy of the other:

    oe_payroll               oe_certified_payroll
    ----------               --------------------
    PayrollBatch             WageDetermination
    PayrollEntry             WageClassification
    PayrollDeduction         WorkerClassificationAssignment
    (oe_payroll_*)           CertifiedPayrollWeek
                             CertifiedPayrollLine
                             (oe_certpay_*)

The pay run answers "what did we pay this person, and when". The compliance
record answers "what were we required to pay them, on whose authority, and did
we say so in writing". Neither question is derivable from the other: a rate on
its own does not say which determination it had to meet, and a determination on
its own does not say what anybody worked.

The join runs one way only. This module reads ``PayrollEntry`` (hours, rate,
work date), ``PayrollBatch`` (project, currency) and ``PayrollDeduction``, and
it uses ``payroll.intl`` for the money arithmetic so there is one implementation
of overtime in the tree. It writes nothing back, declares no relationship or
foreign key onto any ``oe_payroll_*`` table, and links to a worker through a
soft ``resource_id`` column that mirrors ``PayrollEntry.resource_id`` without
constraining it. Deleting this module leaves the pay run untouched.

This split is worth stating because it is not obvious from the names, and both
the author of this module and its reviewer independently started from the
assumption that a certified payroll must be a second payroll. It is not. It is
a statement about a pay run that already happened.

What this module is NOT
=======================

It is not a second payroll. ``oe_payroll`` already aggregates field hours into
``PayrollBatch`` / ``PayrollEntry`` / ``PayrollDeduction`` per worker per day,
and that stays the one live payroll model. The weekly form is a pivot of those
rows: one line per worker per classification, with the hours spread across the
seven days of the week. Before a week is certified there are no rows in
``oe_certpay_line`` at all - the service derives the week live from the payroll
entries, so there is never a second live copy of the same hours to drift.

``oe_certpay_line`` exists only from the moment somebody signs. A certified
payroll is a legal record submitted to an awarding body: it has to say what was
certified, not what the payroll happens to say today. So certification freezes
the derived rows into real columns, denormalising the classification title, the
determination identifier and both required rates alongside them. Renaming a
classification next month must not silently rewrite a statement somebody signed
last month.

Basic and fringe are held apart, everywhere
===========================================

A prevailing wage is a basic hourly rate plus a fringe benefit rate, and the
contractor may discharge the fringe into a bona fide plan or pay it in cash.
Overtime is computed on the basic rate alone, never on basic plus fringe.
Folding the two into one number is the single most common certified payroll
error, and it is not a mistake this schema can express: there is no column
anywhere holding a combined prevailing rate. ``required_basic_rate`` and
``required_fringe_rate`` come from the determination; ``paid_basic_rate`` and
``paid_fringe_rate`` are what the contractor asserts it actually paid; the
election between plan and cash is its own column, because the statement of
compliance has to state it per worker and a single blended rate cannot.

No rate table ships
===================

Wage determinations are per craft, per county, per awarding body, and they are
reissued on a schedule this repository cannot track. Nothing here is seeded.
A determination row is what the contractor received from the awarding body and
typed in, and it carries where it came from (``authority``, ``identifier``,
``decision_date``, ``source_note``) so the record says which document fixed the
rate. The rates live on the classification because the record has to reproduce
what was certified years later; that is a historical record of one document,
not a shipped schedule of what any craft earns anywhere.

Money is Decimal-as-string, matching ``oe_payroll``. Dates are ISO YYYY-MM-DD
strings for the same reason: these rows are read back verbatim into a form.
