"""Find the header row of an uploaded spreadsheet.

Importers used to take row 1 as the header, always. An export that carries
the company letterhead (:mod:`app.core.xlsx_branding`) has the firm's name,
address and the document title above its table, so a workbook exported with
a letterhead and uploaded again would map no column and import nothing,
without an error. These helpers let an importer read such a file back.

The rule, the same for every importer that uses it:

* row 1 is the header when it names two or more known columns, which is what
  a header this platform maps looks like;
* otherwise the first row below it that names two or more is the header,
  within the first :data:`HEADER_SEARCH_ROWS` rows. One known name in row 1
  does not stop the search, because a firm called "Total" or "Title" puts
  exactly one there;
* when no row qualifies, row 1 stays the header as it always was, and the rows
  looked at are handed back as data, so the importer sees what it saw before.

``match`` is the importer's own header matcher, so each importer keeps its own
column names and aliases.

Pure and stdlib-only: rows are whatever ``iter_rows(values_only=True)`` or
``csv.reader`` yields.
