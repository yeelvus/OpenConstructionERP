// The purchase-order flow, from the page a buyer lands on to the body the
// server receives.
//
// This is the first test this page has had, so it covers the spine of the
// flow rather than one control: the page mounts, the create form opens where a
// buyer expects it, the bill-position picker is reachable there, and the
// position they pick survives all the way into the submitted payload.
//
// The picker half exists because <BillPositionPicker> has a thorough test of
// its own that mounts the component itself. No component test can fail because
// nothing in the app mounts the component, so it stayed green through the three
// days the picker was written, covered and imported by nothing, and coverage
// counted it the whole time. What a component test cannot do is start where a
// buyer starts and press what is actually in front of them.
//
// Assertions key on the per-line accessible name - "Bill position for line 1" -
// because only the picker renders it, and only from inside the per-line map of
// the order form. Matching the bare "Bill position" label would be weaker: the
// picker gives that same text to its own search box as a placeholder, so a hit
// on it would not tell a mounted control apart from its own internals.
//
// The empty-spine test is the negative control and it is why the reachability
// test means anything. It presses the same button with no cost spine behind the
// project, proves the form opened all the same, and requires the picker to be
// absent. Without it, an assertion that merely tracked "the modal is open"
// would pass just as well and prove nothing about the picker.
