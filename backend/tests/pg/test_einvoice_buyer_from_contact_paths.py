"""An invoice naming a contact carries that contact's address into both documents.

Two callers render an invoice with the EN 16931 engine: the finance export route
and the clearance module. The buyer had to be resolved for both or the same
invoice would export in one and be refused in the other, which is why this
exercises each of them against a real row rather than testing the resolver alone
and assuming the callers reach it.

The invoices below name their seller on the document so that the only thing
under test is where the buyer comes from. Direction matters: on a receivable
invoice the contact is the customer, on a payable one it is the supplier, and
mapping the latter into the buyer slot would file a company as the recipient of
its own invoice.
