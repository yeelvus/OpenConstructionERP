// Writing direction has to follow the active language, and it has to do it at
// three separate moments that fail independently: on <html> at all, from the
// language the reader actually picked, and again when they pick another one at
// runtime. Four of the languages we offer are written right to left, and for
// them a page left in `dir="ltr"` puts the sidebar on the wrong edge and every
// label against the wrong margin while the strings themselves are perfectly
// translated - so the product reads as broken rather than as untranslated, and
// nothing in the string-level i18n gates can see it.
//
// The population is derived from `SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES` rather than written out
// as ['ar','fa','he','ur']. A hardcoded list would keep passing on the day a
// fifth right-to-left language is added without direction support, which is the
// exact regression this file exists to catch; deriving it means the new entry
// joins the assertion by existing.
//
// Run:  npx vitest run src/app/__tests__/documentDirectionFollowsTheLanguage.test.ts
