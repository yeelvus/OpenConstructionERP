"""A KPI can be read one estimate at a time.

A stored KPI value was a value of one project over one period, and a project
that holds several estimates had no way to say which one a number belonged to.
For money and contract value that rolls up honestly. For anything normalised it
does not: a house remodel quoted once and then extended by eight separately
approved and separately contracted additions has nine areas, nine durations and
nine margins, some of the additions have no area at all, and the average of
those nine is not a rougher version of the right answer. It is a number with no
referent, and it looks exactly like a measurement.

So a value gains an estimate, and the tests here are mostly about the ways that
could go quietly wrong rather than about the narrowing itself:

* ``boq_id IS NULL`` has to keep meaning "the whole project" on the read side
  too. A trend query that simply did not mention the column would start mixing
  per-estimate points into a project's sparkline the day the first
  estimate-scoped KPI was persisted, and the chart would keep drawing.
* An entity that has no estimate of its own must refuse, not widen. The
  project's figure is always reachable and is plausible, which is what makes
  serving it under an estimate's label the worst of the available failures.
* An estimate id is a caller-supplied name for a row set that
  ``allowed_project_ids`` knows nothing about, so it has to be resolved to its
  owning project before anything is read.
