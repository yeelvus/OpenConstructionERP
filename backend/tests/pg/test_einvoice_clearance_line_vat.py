"""One invoice row must not become two different documents.

An invoice can be rendered as EN 16931 by two callers: the finance export
route, and the clearance module when a tax authority asks for the document.
Both read the same row and both hand plain dicts to the same engine, so the
only way they can disagree is by building those dicts differently - which is
exactly what happened. The finance route flattens its lines through
``_line_item_dicts``, which carries BT-152 and BT-151; the clearance module
built its line dicts inline and left both out. A mixed-rate invoice therefore
exported with its rates and cleared without them, and nothing said so, because
the invoice-level fallback produces a document that reconciles and passes every
rule. It is simply a different document about the same money.

The mixed rates are asserted before the two payloads are compared, and that
order is deliberate: equality alone is satisfied by both paths flattening
together, and the failure that matters reads as "the clearance path lost the
rates" rather than as a diff of two XML blobs.

Scope, so a later reader is not misled: the header dicts the two callers build
are field for field identical today (``finance/router.py`` around the export
route, ``einvoice_clearance/service.py`` in ``build_payload_from_invoice``), so
the header assembled below stands in for the finance one faithfully. What this
pins is the line dicts, where the divergence lived. A future divergence in the
header is out of its reach and would need the route itself.
