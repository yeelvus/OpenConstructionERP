"""A state pack may not state a rule it cannot source.

The Texas and California packs carry tax treatments, wage duties, retainage
caps and statutory deadlines. A user prices work on those figures, so a wrong
one is worse than a missing one: an estimator who sees no retainage rule goes
and looks the cap up, while an estimator who sees the wrong cap bids it.

The rule these tests enforce is therefore not "the number is right" - no test
can know that - but "the number says where it came from and when it started".
Every entry in ``STATE_RULES`` must carry a non-empty ``statute_reference``,
and must carry an ``effective_date`` key whose value is either an ISO date, an
ISO year-month, a bare year, or ``None``. ``None`` is a permitted answer and a
deliberate one, following the convention the payment-clock table already uses
for its null deadlines: it says the commencement was not established, which is
a different statement from "there is no commencement" and from "it started
today". What is not permitted is the key being absent, because then nobody can
tell which of the three was meant.

The second thing these tests hold is the join. A state config names payment
clock regime codes, and the clock has to actually ship them; a rule that points
at a regime the seeder never creates is a dangling reference that no page would
show as broken. So the codes are checked against ``REGIME_CODES``, both ways.

Pure dict and filesystem work. No database, no app bootstrapping, no fixtures,
so nothing here can be skipped by a database marker and quietly take a whole
file's coverage with it.
