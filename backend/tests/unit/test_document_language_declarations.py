"""Every route that renders a document declares the language it rendered.

The defect this file exists to stop is not a wrong header, it is an absent one.
``AcceptLanguageMiddleware`` sets ``Content-Language`` on every response with
``setdefault``, so a route that stays silent does not ship an undeclared
document: it ships one labelled with whatever the reader asked for. A German
reader downloading an English tender package receives bytes that say they are
German, and nothing in the request, the response or the archive records that a
fallback happened.

Two tests rather than one, because they fail for opposite reasons.

The first names every rendering route and asserts it declares. It fails when a
declaration is removed, and it is deliberately a list rather than a search, so
that it cannot be weakened by the same predicate bug twice.

The second searches for PDF-serving routes and asserts the search finds nothing
the list does not already hold. It fails when a route is *added*, which is the
case a list alone can never catch, and it is where the sixteenth export lands
the day somebody writes one. Its predicate is deliberately over-broad: a route
that serves a stored file will trip it, and answering that is one line in the
serves-stored list below, which is cheaper than the alternative of a narrow
predicate that quietly misses a real renderer. Three separate predicates written
against the *shape* of these calls have already missed real routes: a literal
media type misses ``media_type=media_type``, a verb list of render/generate/
build misses ``export_report_file``, and keying on a reportlab import misses the
two exports that assemble PDF syntax by hand.
