"""A BIM-LV container must not export a bill's section headers.

A section header is a ``Position`` carrying a sentinel unit, and the BOQ module
spells that sentinel two ways: ``""`` from the demo seeders, ``"section"`` from
``create_section`` and every file importer. ``export_container`` filtered on the
second spelling alone, so a seeded bill exported its headers as LV positions.

The damage was not a stray row. ``export_container`` writes ``pos.unit or
"pcs"``, and the empty spelling is falsy, so each header left the platform as a
DIN SPEC 91350 position measured in pieces, with the quantity and rate of zero
that made it a header in the first place. A consumer of the container has no way
to tell that back from a real, free-of-charge count position.

Run:
    cd backend
    python -m pytest tests/integration/test_bimlv_export_section_headers.py -v
