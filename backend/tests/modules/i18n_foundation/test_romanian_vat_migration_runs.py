"""``v3308`` run against a real database, not just read.

Why this file exists separately from the repair's own tests
-----------------------------------------------------------
The repair that reaches a customer is
``app.modules.i18n_foundation.romania_vat.repair_romanian_vat_rates``, run from
the boot-path registry, and ``test_romanian_vat_repair.py`` covers it. The
revision is the second half, written for operators who run ``alembic upgrade``
by hand, and it is written twice on purpose - the registry docstring explains
why a generic replayer was rejected.

Written twice means it can be wrong twice, and the revision half is the half
nobody exercises. Its statements are raw SQL: a cast that does not match the
``id`` column's type, a JSON bind the driver renders as the text of a dict, an
INSERT naming a column that does not exist. None of that is visible by reading,
and none of it is caught by the repair's tests, which never touch this file.

So these tests side-load the revision and run its ``_repair_rows`` against the
same PostgreSQL the rest of the suite uses. The assertions deliberately mirror
``test_romanian_vat_repair.py``: the two halves have to agree about what the
database looks like afterwards, and asserting different things about them would
be how they drift.
