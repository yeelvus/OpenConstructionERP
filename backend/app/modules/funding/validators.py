"""Validation rules for a public funding application.

Public funding is lost in a small number of specific ways, and almost none of
them are caught by looking at the application form. They are caught by
comparing two dates, or two amounts, that live on different screens. That is
exactly what a validation rule is for, so these five are the module's rules
rather than a checklist somebody has to remember to open.

* ``funding.measure_starts_after_application`` - work began before the
  application was filed. This is the single most expensive mistake in the
  field, because it is usually unfixable: most programmes exclude the whole
  measure rather than the early part, and no later approval repairs it.
  German practice calls the prohibition Verbot des vorzeitigen
  Maßnahmenbeginns, United States federal practice calls the same money
  pre-award costs, and both allow it only with written permission granted in
  advance, which is why the rule can be told about that permission instead of
  being switched off.

* ``funding.costs_fall_in_the_award_period`` - a draw claims a period that
  reaches outside the window the award named. Costs dated outside it are not
  claimable, and a draw that overlaps the boundary is usually paid first and
  clawed back later, which is worse than a refusal.

* ``funding.own_share_is_covered`` - the applicant is not carrying the share
  the programme requires it to carry. Stated against the eligible base rather
  than the project total, because that is the base the programme computes on.

* ``funding.cumulation_within_aid_intensity`` - everything public on this
  project, added together, is over the ceiling one of its programmes names.
  Aid is cumulated across programmes and across levels of government, so an
  application that is faultless on its own can breach the cap by existing
  alongside another one.

* ``funding.proof_of_use_is_on_time`` - the award period has ended and the
  report that has to follow it is missing or late.

The first two are ERROR and the rest are WARNING, which is a departure from
the neighbouring modules, where every rule is a warning. The reason is not
severity of consequence but who can still act. A warning says two figures
disagree and a person must decide which to believe. These two say a date has
already passed in a way that cannot be argued with: the work started when it
started. Nothing downstream should treat such an application as submittable,
so they block.
