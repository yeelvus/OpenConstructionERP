/**
 * The pure decisions the Full EVM screen makes for itself.
 *
 * Everything else on the panel is the server's answer rendered as it came. The
 * register computes every EVM figure exactly, in Decimal, and persists it, so
 * nothing here recomputes SPI, CPI, EAC, ETC, VAC or TCPI. What is here is the
 * reading of those figures — which band an index falls in, which way a variance
 * points — plus the few derivations the API genuinely does not return: the
 * per-period amount hidden inside a cumulative curve, and how far the three EAC
 * formulas disagree with each other.
 *
 * Two rules run through all of it.
 *
 * **`null` is undefined, not zero.** The register stores NULL for an index
 * whose denominator was zero and the wire carries `null`. Zero is a different
 * and equally real answer: a CPI of 0 means money was spent and nothing was
 * earned. Collapsing the two reports a project that has not started as the
 * worst-performing one on the books.
 *
 * **Zero is an answer.** A variance of exactly 0 is a project exactly on plan,
 * and a completion of exactly 0 is a project that has earned nothing. Neither
 * is a missing value, so nothing here tests an amount for truthiness.
 *
 * They live apart from the panel deliberately: importing the panel pulls in the
 * shared UI barrel, which transitively boots i18next with the whole English
 * resource, and a vitest worker that does that never answers. The type imports
 * below are erased at compile time, so this module has no runtime dependency on
 * anything — which also means nothing here may return a user-facing string.
 * Bands and tones come back as keys the caller translates.
