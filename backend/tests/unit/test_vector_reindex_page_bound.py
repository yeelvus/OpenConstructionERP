"""A vector reindex must read the collection, and let go of it, one page at a time.

``create_vector_routes`` is the factory behind ``POST /vector/reindex/`` in six
modules, so whatever shape it reads in is the shape all six read in. It read the
whole table in one buffered statement and then held every entity for the length
of the pass. Measured on this tree with tracemalloc, one loaded row costs
2.5 KiB (a requirement) to 29.7 KiB (a validation report, whose ``results`` JSON
carries one entry per rule fired), with documents at 2.7 and tasks, risks and
chat messages between 4.7 and 7.3 - so a 100 000-row collection of the heaviest
kind
is ~2.9 GiB held at once, on a platform whose stated floor is a 3 GB server that
also runs PostgreSQL.

Paging that read is only half of the bound, and the half that is easy to believe
in wrongly: a ``Session`` keeps every entity it hands out until the transaction
ends, whatever shape the read had. The page has to be released as well, which is
why the recorder below models an identity map and why the peak it holds - not
the size of a page - is what the third test asserts. A recorder that forgot its
rows would report a flat peak whether or not the release happened and could not
tell the two apart.

The controls: one run with the bound raised out of reach, which is what removing
the paging would look like from inside the handler, and one comparing a paged
pass against an unpaged one on every key it returns and every row it embeds -
paging a walk is only correct if it changes nothing but the peak.

The ceiling is the other half. Every row on this path goes through the embedding
model inside the request, so a cap belongs here - but a cap that is not reported
hands the caller a plausible ``indexed`` count and nothing to say the rest of the
collection is not searchable. A collection that ends exactly ON the ceiling is
complete and must not raise that flag.

The last two cover the custom-scope branch. A scope used to return its rows,
which defeated any bound the factory could apply, so it now returns the SELECT
and the factory owns the walk for every module at once.

No database is involved: the session is replaced by a recorder that serves the
pages the statement asks for and holds them until they are expunged, and the
embedding side by a recorder that counts what it was handed.
