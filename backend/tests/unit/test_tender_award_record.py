"""The award record is assembled from the procedure and names what is missing.

German public procurement asks a contracting authority to keep a written record
of the award procedure while the procedure runs (VOB/A section 20 below the EU
threshold, VgV section 8 above it). Two properties are what make such a record
worth anything, and both are tested here.

*It is contemporaneous.* The record is readable from the first day and says what
it still owes at the stage it stands at, instead of appearing only once an award
exists. What it owes is read from what the procedure shows has happened, not
from the status column: a package may go from draft straight to closed, and a
procedure cancelled before it began does not owe an award reason.

*Its facts are the procedure's own.* Change a bid and the record changes,
because there is no stored copy of the bid to go stale. What is stored is only
what a person had to say, and storing that leaves everything else on the package
exactly as it was.

Pure over stub objects, no database, the same as the scope reader next door.
