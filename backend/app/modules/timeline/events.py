"""Timeline bridge subscriber - persist significant events to the audit store.

The in-memory event bus (:mod:`app.core.events`) loses everything on restart.
This bridge subscribes a single wildcard handler that, for each *significant*
cross-module domain event (see :mod:`app.modules.timeline.mapping`), writes one
:class:`app.core.audit_log.ActivityLog` row so the unified project timeline
survives a process restart.

The handler is best-effort: it opens its own async session (publishers may
already hold one; on embedded PostgreSQL a concurrent second session for a
short write is fine), and the whole body is wrapped so a failure here can
*never* break the publisher. Registration is idempotent.
