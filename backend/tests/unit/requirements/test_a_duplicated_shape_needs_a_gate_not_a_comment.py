"""A comment saying two shapes must stay in sync does not keep them in sync.

``bim_hub.schemas.RequirementBrief`` is a hand-written subset of
``requirements.schemas.RequirementResponse``, defined locally so bim_hub does
not have to import requirements and create a cycle. That is a reasonable
trade. What was not reasonable is that the only thing holding the two together
was a sentence in a docstring: "the two shapes MUST stay in sync". Nothing ran.

The failure mode is quiet in the direction that matters. Rename or drop a field
in the requirements schema and the brief keeps declaring it, so pydantic fills
it from a default and the BIM viewer renders a plausible wrong value forever.
Nobody sees a stack trace, because ``from_attributes`` reading a name the ORM
no longer has is exactly the case a default exists for.

So the test is one-directional on purpose. The brief is allowed to be smaller,
that is its whole reason for existing, but every name it does carry has to
still mean the same thing on the other side. Adding a field to the requirements
schema is not a failure here; removing one that the brief still claims is.
