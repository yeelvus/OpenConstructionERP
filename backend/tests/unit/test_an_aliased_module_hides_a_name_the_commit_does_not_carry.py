"""The head-import guard follows a module reached through a local name.

On 2026-08-29 the three supplier-catalog delete endpoints published event topics
that ``app/modules/supplier_catalogs/events.py`` did not define. The module was
imported as a module and the topics were read off it as attributes, so nothing
failed on load, nothing dropped out of the registry, and the guard that exists
to prove a commit can import itself said the commit was fine. The name was read
at call time, on the line announcing the deletion, which is after the guard and
after the delete: a refused delete returned its 409 and an allowed one returned
500. That is the shape this test pins, and it is the shape a checker reading
import statements alone cannot see, because the import statement says nothing
about which names the module carries.

Two things are worth proving and they pull in opposite directions. The guard has
to report the alias shape, and it has to stay silent on the code it walks past
every run, because a gate that is wrong in the other direction is worse than no
gate - it gets switched off and then catches nothing at all. So every red case
here comes with the same source one word away from it in green.

The script carries its own self-test and runs it on every invocation. This is
not a copy of it. The self-test fails the script; these fail the suite, which is
what anyone changing the script will actually run, and the fixtures below are
the incident rather than a minimal shape chosen to exercise a branch.
