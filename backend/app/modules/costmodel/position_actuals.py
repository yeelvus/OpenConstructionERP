"""What actually happened against each bill position, read back from the site.

The Cost Spine rollup answers this question already, and answers it in the
language of money: per cost line, what was budgeted, committed, contracted and
claimed. That is the right shape for a cost report and the wrong shape for the
person who wrote the estimate. An estimator works in bill positions, sees a
quantity and a rate, and wants one row per item of work.

So this module turns the rollup around. It is keyed by ``boq_position_id``, it
carries the position's own ordinal, description and unit, and it puts two
physical facts next to the money that the cost line does not hold:

* how much of the item is installed, from the progress module's latest
  percent-complete observation for that position;
* how much material was consumed against it and what that material cost, from
  the site inventory ledger;
* how many hours the crew and the plant booked against it, from approved field
  timesheets.

Which lets one row say the thing nobody could see before: you billed 120 m3 at
180, you have committed 1800 of it, the crew reports 40 percent installed, the
store has issued 55 m3 worth 9900 against it, and the gang has booked 21 hours
on it.

Hours, and the denominator under them
-------------------------------------

Booked hours are the half of the productivity question the platform can know.
The other half, what the estimate predicted, lives in the norm the line was
priced from. This file used to say that nothing records which norm that was.
That was wrong by one hop and stayed wrong long enough to be quoted as the
reason the predicted side was left out: a position built by applying an
assembly carries ``metadata["assembly_id"]``, and an assembly built from a
production norm carries its ``norm_id``, so the norm was always reachable
through the assembly row. What was missing was anybody making that hop, and a
hop through a row that can be edited or deleted after the fact is not
provenance anyway. A position now carries its norm identity directly, on the
``norm_id`` / ``norm_work_key`` columns (v3320), with the metadata keys still
written beside them for readers that predate the columns.

This module still computes only the measured side, and now CARRIES the identity
of the predicted one: every row reports the norm its position was priced from,
so a reader can put the two together without going back to the bill. The
comparison itself - what a norm predicted against what the work booked against
it really consumed - is one grain up from a position and lives in
``app.modules.postcalc.norm_outturn``, which reads these rows. It is one grain
up because a norm is reused across a bill: the question "did this norm hold" is
answered by summing over every position priced from it, and a per-position row
cannot answer it however much provenance it carries.

Even the measured side has a trap in the denominator. Hours divided by the
BILLED quantity on a half-built item reads better the less of the item is
finished, which is the same failure as a zero risk dispersion: an item nobody
has touched would post the best productivity on the project. So the per-unit
figure is reported against the INSTALLED quantity and is None on any position
whose progress nobody has reported. A rate with no denominator is not a rate,
and a blank says so where a number would lie.

Two spines, met in one row
--------------------------

Assembling this means crossing the two links the platform keeps separate, and
the crossing is the reason this file exists rather than the numbers being read
ad hoc wherever they are wanted. The money aggregates are keyed by
``cost_line_id``; progress and inventory are keyed by ``boq_position_id``. The
position carries the cost line it rolls up into, and that field is the only
bridge between them. Nothing here writes either link, and no money value is
looked up by position or physical value by cost line.
``app.modules.procurement.cost_spine`` sets out why the two exist.

Positions off the spine
-----------------------

A position whose ``cost_line_id`` is unset gets a row with its estimate and its
physical progress and zeros for every money column. That is honest rather than
empty: the crew's work is real whether or not the project has generated a cost
spine, and a row that vanished for want of a link would read as no work done.
The ``on_cost_spine`` flag says which of the two a zero is.

Currency
--------

Every money value arrives already converted into the project base currency by
the aggregates in ``CostSpineRepository``, which convert per row so a missing
rate surfaces rather than silently zeroing. Consumed cost is summed from the
inventory ledger in the currency the movements were recorded in and is NOT
converted, because a stock movement carries no currency of its own; on a
project whose stock is valued in one currency, which is every project we have
seen, that is the base currency too. The response says which currency it is
reporting in rather than leaving the reader to assume.
