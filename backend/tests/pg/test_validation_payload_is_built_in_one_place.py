# DDC-CWICR-OE: DataDrivenConstruction - OpenConstructionERP
"""A payload of positions must reach the engine through the shared builder.

A validation rule reads its inputs from the mapping the caller hands the
engine, and a rule whose input is missing returns nothing rather than failing.
So a surface that assembles that mapping by hand is not caught by anything: the
report comes back, the rules that had what they needed ran, and the ones that
did not are absent from a list nobody counted. That is how
``boq_quality.unit_system_consistency`` came to fire on the demo seeder and the
estimate audit while staying silent behind the Validate button, on the same
bill, for the same project.

What is asserted here is the property, not a list of today's surfaces. A gate
that named the four call sites that were wrong in August would pass on the
fifth the day someone writes it, which makes it a check on the list rather than
on the thing. The statement is: anywhere in ``app`` that hands the engine a
payload carrying ``positions``, that payload passes through
:func:`app.core.validation.project_context.with_project_context`. A new surface
is covered without anyone remembering, and one that stops calling the builder
is named by file and line.

Two limits, stated rather than left to be discovered. The check reads source,
so a payload assembled inside a helper the call site merely invokes is opaque
to it - it sees ``data=_my_payload()`` and cannot say what is in there. And it
recognises the builder by name, so aliasing it past the check is possible for
anyone who wants to. Both are the ordinary limits of a source-level property;
neither is reachable by accident, which is what this guards against.

It lives in the PG lane because that lane is a merge gate and the default unit
lane is not. The check itself needs no database.
