"""Keep the budget re-seed suite honest about the guard it claims to describe.

``tests/pg/test_demo_budget_reseed_idempotent.py`` cannot call the seeder's
budget guard: it sits in the middle of an install routine that writes every
module and cannot be entered for one. So that suite mirrors the guard, and a
mirror is a second copy of a rule, which is the failure mode the suite exists
to catch wearing the other face.

It already happened. The real guard moved from ``category`` alone to the whole
of what ``ProjectBudget`` is unique on, ``(project_id, wbs_id, category)``,
because the seed began writing a WBS reference and a bill legitimately carries
one cost group under several sections. The mirror kept the old key, stayed
green, and could no longer have gone red for the defect it was written for -
nor for the new one, where a category-only guard drops the second real line.

These read the seeder's source rather than its behaviour, which is a poor
substitute for calling it and is what is available. They live in the unit lane
on purpose: everything under ``tests/pg/`` is skipped wholesale without
``OE_TEST_DB=pg``, so a pin placed beside the mirror would be missing from
exactly the runs that would otherwise never notice.
