"""The answer has to say whether it knew the country, not only the years.

The sibling module pins the time axes: which year's working week was used, where
it was carried from, and whether that year contributed holidays. All three are
about time, and all three were already honest. The axis missing from the
response was the country itself.

``country_code`` on the response is the code that was asked about. On its own it
read as a claim that this country's calendar produced the answer, which is
exactly what it does not mean for a country with no calendar at all - there the
week is a hardcoded Monday-Friday belonging to nobody. ``jurisdiction`` is that
claim made properly.

The distinction was derivable before this: every entry in ``years`` reads
``default`` exactly when no calendar exists. Derivable is not stated. A caller
should not have to reconstruct a fact about a country from a list about years,
and a single-year range gives it nothing to compare against.

The test that carries the most weight here is
:func:`test_a_known_country_is_still_known_outside_its_seeded_year`, because it
is the case where the two axes disagree: the country is known, the year is not,
and one flag across both would have to pick a side and be wrong about the other.
