"""Discover partner packs - via pip entry-points and via the repo ``packs/`` dir.

A partner pack registers via the entry-point group
``openconstructionerp.partner_packs``::

    [project.entry-points."openconstructionerp.partner_packs"]
    batimatech-ca = "openconstructionerp_batimatech_ca:MANIFEST"

The value must point at a module-level attribute that is either:
  * a ``PartnerPackManifest`` instance, OR
  * a ``dict`` the loader coerces into one.

In addition to pip-installed packs, ``discover_packs()`` also scans a
``packs/`` directory so that packs are listable on the /modules page WITHOUT
being pip-installed: the monorepo tree in a source checkout, and the community
packs shipped beside the ``app`` package after an install. Both are found by
``_packs_dir()``. Filesystem-discovered packs are
listable but are NEVER auto-activated - only an explicit ``OE_PARTNER_PACK``
env var activates a pack (see ``get_active_pack``).

At boot, ``discover_packs()`` enumerates every source. ``get_active_pack()``
picks one based on the precedence:

  1. env var ``OE_PARTNER_PACK`` (matches manifest.slug)
  2. None  - the platform runs in vanilla OCERP mode

    never co-brands the app.

    Precedence:
      1. in-app applied pack (``pack_state.json`` in the ACTIVE data dir - see
         ``state._resolve_state_dir``; ``partner_pack_state.json`` is the LEGACY
         name and is still read when the current one is absent)
      2. env ``OE_PACK=<slug>``, or its backward-compatible alias
         ``OE_PARTNER_PACK``; ``OE_PACK`` wins if both are set
      3. None

    The two names in step 1 and the alias in step 2 are worth stating because
    this docstring used to name only the legacy file and only the alias. Anyone
    debugging why a workspace is scoped looks for the file this text names, does
    not find it, concludes nothing is applied, and goes looking for a bug in the
    scoping instead of reading the record that is right there under the other
    name.

    Cached per resolved state dir, so two instances resolving different data
    dirs never share an answer; ``reset_cache()`` is called by the apply
    service after an apply / un-apply so the change takes effect immediately.
