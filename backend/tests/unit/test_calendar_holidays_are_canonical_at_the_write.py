"""A stored calendar holiday is canonical, and means the same as a CPM exception.

``work_days`` on these models has been constrained since the Monday-zero
convention was settled. ``holidays`` beside it was not, so the calendar write
schemas refused a week running to eight days while accepting a holiday written
``01/05/2026``. That entry reached three different readers and matched in none
of them, and the day was worked as ordinary without anything being logged.

The last group of tests is the one that matters most over time. A calendar
holiday and a CPM calendar exception are the same thing wearing two field
names, and they used to disagree about which spellings they accepted. They now
share one parser, and the agreement is asserted rather than assumed, so a
second parser written later shows up as a failure here instead of as two
schedules that differ by one day.
