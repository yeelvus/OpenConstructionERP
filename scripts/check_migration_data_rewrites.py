"""Report migrations whose upgrade() rewrites rows in a table it did not create.

Grew out of #126: a migration that filled a pre-existing 1724 MB table inside
the single transaction Alembic wraps a whole upgrade() run in died with
DiskFull on a real box, because Postgres keeps every superseded row version
until the transaction commits, so peak disk was roughly twice the table no
matter how the writes were batched. That class of migration - one whose
upgrade() issues INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE against a table that already held rows
before this revision ran - has a disk profile worth a human look before it
ships, whether or not the specific revision turns out to be safe. Creating a
table and filling it in the same revision is a different case: the table is
empty until this revision runs, so there is no pre-existing data to make a
transaction-sized copy of, and that shape is not flagged.

Blocking, in Repo hygiene (a static check over source text, not a database
test - see .github/workflows/repo-hygiene.yml). A flagged revision ships
only if its own file carries a ``# data-rewrite-ack:`` comment for every
table it touches; see "Acknowledging a flagged revision" below. The 24
revisions flagged on the tree the day this went blocking (2026-08-12)
already carry one each. See the summary line for scale: N revisions
scanned, M flagged into how many statements, and how many statements this
could not classify at all (printed separately; a new one not already in
_UNRESOLVED_BASELINE blocks on its own terms, and neither bucket is ever
silently treated as clean). The scan running at all gets the same
treatment: a versions/ directory that resolves but comes back near-empty
reports "clean" for the same reason a passing test suite with zero tests
does, so paths below _MIN_EXPECTED_REVISIONS fails loud in main() instead.
That check exists because of a sibling instrument making the opposite
mistake: .github/workflows/desktop-release.yml's Windows signing job
exits 0 and writes a $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY line plus a ::warning when
AZURE_KV_CLIENT_SECRET is unset, so every release so far has shipped
unsigned installers under a job the run's conclusion field reports as
success, indistinguishable there from a job that signed anything. This
script's own summary line is read by whatever reads a conclusion field,
so it does not get to make that same substitution about its own input.

Known gap in that floor: it catches zero and near-zero, not a
proportional shrink. A reorganisation that splits versions/ into
subfolders and moves, say, half the files would leave the flat glob
below counting only the half left behind - comfortably above 100,
reporting clean over a scan that covered less than the whole tree. A
fixed floor also decays by construction: 100 was chosen against a tree
of 320 files, so it currently requires seeing at least 31% of them, and
against 600 files next year the same constant requires seeing only 17%.
Cross-checking the glob's count against a second, independent
enumeration of the same directory was considered and rejected - Alembic's
own ScriptDirectory discovers revisions by walking that same versions/
path under the same single-directory assumption, so a subfolder split
that fools the glob below would fool Alembic's own view of its
migration tree the same way, and by then CI would presumably be red on
far more than this one script. Naming the gap here is the honest
alternative to a cross-check that could not actually be independent of
the failure mode it exists to catch.

Why AST, not grep or ScriptDirectory.walk_revisions()
------------------------------------------------------
Grep looks for a literal table name next to a literal verb and this codebase
does not write SQL that way: every migration builds its raw SQL as an
f-string over a module-level constant (UPDATE {_ITEM} SET ... with
_ITEM = "oe_costs_item" twenty lines above). A sweep for UPDATE followed by
oe_ misses every one of them and returns a confident, wrong zero.

ScriptDirectory.walk_revisions() imports every migration module to build the
chain, and importing v3121 demands a live DATABASE_URL at collection time.
That would make invoking this script depend on a database being up, so
revisions are read as source text and parsed with ast instead - the same
approach backend/tests/integration/test_migrations_roundtrip.py uses for the
same reason, kept independent here rather than imported so this script
carries no pytest or psycopg2 dependency.

Resolution and confidence tiers
--------------------------------
A table name reaches a SQL string several ways in this codebase, in
increasing order of how much has to be inferred to name it:

* literal - a plain string, or a chain of simple NAME = "value" indirections
  (including through sa.text(...), sa.table(...) / sa.Table(...), and
  .bindparams(...), all transparent wrappers for this purpose), with no
  loop or function call standing between the constant and its use.
* derived - the name came from unpacking a module-level literal collection
  in a for loop (e.g. a table name that is the first element of each tuple
  in a list this revision iterates), or passed through a single-argument
  helper call this script cannot inspect the body of and therefore assumes
  is a pass-through (e.g. an identifier-validation helper that returns its
  argument unchanged or raises). Both are real answers, not guesses about
  intent, but resting on an assumption this script did not verify by
  reading the helper.
* unresolved - this script could not determine the SQL text, or could not
  determine the table a resolved statement targets, at all. Listed
  separately from confirmed findings rather than dropped, because a
  statement this script cannot read is not evidence of anything either way.
  In the corpus this scan was built against, most of these are DDL - a
  dialect-conditional CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY or an ALTER TABLE ADD
  CONSTRAINT whose index or constraint name comes from a value this script
  cannot pin down - where the verb itself is plainly not UPDATE/INSERT/
  DELETE/MERGE but the rest of the statement never resolves far enough to
  say so on the record; the remainder is a Core select(...).where(...) read
  built from more than one comparison and a bare SELECT setval(...) that
  advances a sequence rather than writing a table row, neither a
  data-modifying statement to begin with. None of these found a write; they
  show up here because this script does not model boolean expressions or
  chase every non-DML verb, not because a write went unseen. A statement
  landing here is never required to carry an acknowledgement - there is no
  table to name growth for until this script can name the table - but its
  identity, (filename, ast.unparse() of the call), is checked against
  _UNRESOLVED_BASELINE and a statement whose identity is new blocks the
  run; see that constant for the current eight and what to do about a
  ninth.

Known blind spots, deliberately not covered
---------------------------------------------
An ALTER COLUMN ... TYPE change (batch or plain) can rewrite every row of a
pre-existing table on PostgreSQL to re-encode the column, which is the same
disk-profile class this script exists to flag - but it is a schema
statement, not a data-modifying one, and the rule as specified is about
statements that modify data. 7f3ab0f2d4e1_phase2e_money_numeric.py is a real
example on the current tree. Naming it here rather than folding it into this
rule, which would require a different detector (schema-op scan, not DML-op
scan) and a different, harder to state safety condition.

A table name arriving as a function parameter, rather than a module-level
constant, a for-loop target, or a locally reassigned literal, is invisible
to this script's scope model and so cannot reach ``created``. Five files on
the current tree share an ``_create_if_not_exists(table_name, *columns,
**kw)`` helper with exactly this shape (a1b2c3d4e5f6_add_collab_lock_table.py,
f22fa2934807_add_bim_element_group_table.py,
ffe3f561e2c1_add_documents_bim_link_table.py, v090_add_all_new_modules.py,
v191_dwg_entity_groups.py) - none of them issue any DML at all, so this is
a latent gap rather than a live false positive today, but a future revision
that both creates a table this way and writes to it in the same upgrade()
would be flagged as touching pre-existing data when it does not. Extending
the scope model to bind a called function's parameters from the literal
arguments a call site passes would close this without weakening anything
else, and is future work rather than something this revision of the script
attempts.

Acknowledging a flagged revision
---------------------------------
A flagged revision ships only if its own source carries one line per table
it touches, in this exact shape::

    # data-rewrite-ack: table=oe_costs_item growth=tenure rows=core cost-estimation line items across every project; already 1724 MB in the field, see #126

Three fields, all required. ``table=`` is the table this acknowledges - a
finding whose table has no matching line still blocks. ``growth=`` is
``tenure`` if the row count tracks operational history (a row per
transaction, per day, per measurement, per entry - the table keeps growing
for as long as a customer keeps using the product), ``bounded`` if it
tracks a catalogue or configuration instead (it is what it is, regardless
of how long the install has run), or ``dead-code`` for the one shape that
is neither: a statement this script found that provably cannot execute,
e.g. guarded by a check against a table name that has never existed - see
v3145_demo_project_addresses.py, the only case on this tree today, and read
its comment above ``upgrade()`` before assuming a second one is the same
shape. ``dead-code`` is the one value that asserts something about the
code rather than about the data, and code changes under a repair in a way
a table's growth class does not: the day someone fixes the guard, the
statement goes live, and an ack that still reads dead-code would be a
live rewrite wearing a never-runs label - the worst object this gate
could produce. So a dead-code ``rows=`` must also carry an issue
reference (``#NNN``) naming the guard - see v3145's line - putting the
repair and the stale claim in the same diff a future reviewer reads.
``rows=`` is otherwise a free-text estimate of row count on a mature
install.

Keyed on (revision, table), not on revision alone: one revision touching
several tables needs one line per table (v3033_audit_log.py touches four -
oe_finance_invoice, oe_ncr_ncr, oe_rfq_rfq, oe_submittals_submittal), because
growth class is a property of the table, not of the migration, and a single
label across all of them would hide exactly the distinction that matters.
The comment can sit anywhere in the file - this is a plain text scan, not
part of the ast walk above, because the requirement is that the revision
carries an acknowledgement for each table, not that one specific line does,
and this codebase's flagged statements are sometimes reached through a
helper several lines from anything a line-anchored scan could find.

This grew out of #126: v3273_backfill_cost_item_currency.py rewrote
oe_costs_item, 1724 MB in the field, inside the single transaction Alembic
wraps a whole upgrade() in, and died with DiskFull on a real box. The
danger was never the UPDATE by itself - it was writing to a table whose
size nobody had checked first. A megabyte figure measured on a demo
database cannot answer whether a table will be large on a customer box
three years in, because oe_costs_item was small on a fresh demo too, before
years of real projects filled it; only a table's growth class can answer
that, which is why the acknowledgement asks for growth class rather than
for a size measured somewhere that cannot see a mature install. Five tables
on this tree are the worked example of the shape that bites hardest:
oe_field_diary_entry, oe_progress_entry, oe_payroll_entry /
oe_payroll_batch, oe_takeoff_measurement (with oe_ai_takeoff_run and
oe_takeoff_document), and oe_boq_position - each small wherever it has only
been measured on a fresh install, and each the kind of table that
accumulates one row per real-world event for as long as a customer keeps
using the product, exactly the way oe_costs_item did.

An acknowledgement is deliberately not a size and not a bare marker: a
number pulled from nowhere - or measured on a demo box that cannot have
lived through the tenure that matters - is worse than useless, and a token
with no content is a rubber stamp within a month. Writing the three fields
honestly is the actual review a flagged revision has to pass: a human who
has never seen a customer's database can still say whether a table is a
log of something that keeps happening, or a catalogue that is what it is,
without needing to know a row count nobody watching a demo box could give
them.
