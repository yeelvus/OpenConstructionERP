"""Internationalization system.

28 languages built into core. Zero hardcoded strings.
New language = add a JSON file to locales/ AND an entry in both lists below.
A file without a list entry is unreachable, because every caller that picks a
locale (the Accept-Language middleware, the /i18n routes) gates on
SUPPORTED_LOCALES; a list entry without a file is a language offered by
get_available_locales() that silently serves English. tests/unit/
test_backend_locale_catalogue.py holds the two sides equal.

Backend: returns translation keys or resolved strings.
Frontend: loads locale JSON, resolves client-side.

Usage:
    from app.core.i18n import t, set_locale

    set_locale("de")
    msg = t("validation.missing_quantity", position="01.02.0030")
    # → "Position 01.02.0030 hat keine Menge"
