"""One commercial change must move a contract's value exactly once.

Promoting a variation request mirrors the resulting variation order into
``oe_changeorders`` as a draft change order
(``VariationsService.convert_vr_to_vo``). Two independent wave-5
subscribers can then add money to the same contract: one on variation
order completion, one on change order approval. They originally
deduplicated only against their own metadata bucket, so nothing stopped
the mirrored pair from posting the same amount twice.

Both now post under a shared source key naming the commercial change
rather than the row (``_contract_source_key``), so the pair posts once in
either arrival order. That ordering independence is the point of the
shape and is asserted directly, because a guard keyed on whether the
money has already landed can only ever close one of the two orders.

Reachability is the whole point of this file, so it is asserted rather
than assumed:

* the mirror as created carries no ``metadata.contract_id``, so the
  change order subscriber returns before it opens a session - the plain
  promote / complete / approve flow posts once;
* the mirror is a *draft*, and ``ChangeOrderUpdate`` accepts ``metadata``
  which ``update_order`` merges, so linking it to the very contract the
  variation order already names is one PATCH away - and that is the pair
  that used to post twice.

The events are recorded from the real publishers and handed to the real
handlers, so the payloads under test are the ones the services actually
emit. Driving the handlers directly keeps the assertions free of the
detached-publish race; ``test_subscribers_are_registered`` asserts the
wiring that production relies on to call them.
