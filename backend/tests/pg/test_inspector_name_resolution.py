"""An inspector has to reach the client as a name, whoever wrote the row.

``QualityInspection.inspector_id`` is a bare 36-character string with no
foreign key, and three different writers put three different things in it: the
demo seeder writes a contact id, a picker writes a user id, and the free-text
field on the create form writes whatever somebody typed. The list endpoint used
to hand that value straight to the client, so a seeded register printed a row
of UUIDs under a column headed "Inspector".

These tests pin the resolution and, just as importantly, the fallback: a value
that resolves to nothing must come back unchanged, because a typed name is
already the answer and a deleted party's id is the only trace of it left.
