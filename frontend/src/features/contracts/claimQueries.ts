// A claim's stored gross, retention and net are derived from its lines, and so
// are its G702 face, its submission check and its row in the register. A
// screen that writes a line and keeps any of those is showing figures from
// before the write - which is how a claim gets billed on totals nobody
// recognises. So the write path names them in one place rather than each
// caller remembering the list.
