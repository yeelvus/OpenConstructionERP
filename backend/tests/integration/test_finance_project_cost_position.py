"""End to end: one project's budget, committed, invoiced and paid on the finance dashboard.

A main contractor records supplier invoices, pays its subcontractors and wants
one screen that says where the project stands. This drives exactly that job
through the real HTTP API and asserts every figure ``GET /finance/dashboard/``
returns for it.

The scenario (EUR, VAT 25 %)
----------------------------
* Bill of quantities, net, two WBS groups under two sections. The sections
  carry their own subtotal, as a real bill does, so a roll-up that sums every
  row instead of the priced leaves counts the bill twice.

  ====  ==========================  ===========
  WBS   leaf                         net
  ====  ==========================  ===========
  01    excavation 2 000 m3 x 30     60 000
  01    backfill   1 000 m3 x 40     40 000
  02    concrete   1 000 m3 x 150   150 000
  02    rebar     50 000 kg x 3     150 000
  ====  ==========================  ===========

  Locking the bill makes the budget: 400 000 net.
* Purchase order for rebar, 20 000 kg x 2.50 = 50 000 net + 12 500 VAT,
  approved and issued; 16 000 kg received and confirmed.
* Supplier invoice against that order, 16 000 kg = 40 000 net + 10 000 VAT,
  approved and paid in full (50 000 cash).
* A direct supplier invoice with no order behind it (site container hire),
  2 000 net + 500 VAT, approved, unpaid.
* Subcontract agreement 120 000 EUR, 5 % retention, active. One payment
  application for 30 000 gross, approved by foreman and finance and paid:
  1 500 retention held, 28 500 cash.

Basis of every figure (the point of the test)
---------------------------------------------
* budget: net of VAT, from the locked bill.
* actual (``total_actual``): net, what has been incurred. The order at the
  larger of what was received and what was settled on its invoices (40 000
  either way, the same money), the paid payment application at its gross
  (retention is owed, only later). 40 000 + 30 000 = 70 000.
* committed: net, the part of each commitment not yet incurred, so that
  committed plus actual is the outturn. The order 50 000 - 40 000, the
  agreement 120 000 - 30 000, and the supplier invoice no order stands behind
  at its own 2 000 (money spent without an order is committed the day it is
  invoiced). 10 000 + 90 000 + 2 000 = 102 000; outturn 172 000.
* invoiced: net. Supplier invoices at their subtotal, payment applications at
  the gross finance approved (before retention, which is still owed).
  40 000 + 2 000 + 30 000 = 72 000.
* paid (``total_paid``): cash out, VAT included, as the bank sees it.
  50 000 + 28 500 = 78 500.
* ``total_payable`` keeps its meaning: supplier invoices not yet marked paid,
  gross. 2 500.
* ``total_payments`` keeps its meaning: every payment row, either direction.
  The paid pay application is paid through its payable invoice, so its
  28 500 is a payment row next to the supplier's 50 000: 78 500.

The order-first variant approves the purchase order before any bill is
locked, which is the order a busy site works in. A commitment counter that
needs a budget row to exist loses the order in that case.

The budget rows carry the same committed and actual line by line, so the
Budgets table adds up to the dashboard; that is asserted after every step,
not only at the end, because a step whose write does not reach the rows is
exactly what the end state can hide.
