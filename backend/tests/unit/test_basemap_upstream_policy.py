# DDC-CWICR-OE: DataDrivenConstruction - OpenConstructionERP
"""Policy gate for every third-party host the basemap proxy talks to.

WHY THIS EXISTS. The basemap upstream was a keyless CARTO raster. It stopped
being keyless with no release, no notice and no failing check: it kept
answering 200, with the right number of bytes, with a decodable PNG of the
correct geography, and printed "API KEY REQUIRED" across the picture. Every
check we had asked the transport whether we were answered. None asked whether
we were answered with what we requested. The founder found it by looking at
the screen.

WHY THIS GATE IS NOT A PROBE. The obvious reaction is to fetch a tile in CI
and assert something about it. That is the wrong gate twice over. A live fetch
makes the build depend on somebody else's uptime, so it goes flaky, and a
flaky gate gets muted. Worse, the failure mode above is invisible to every
assertion a probe can cheaply make: status, length and decode were all green
on the watermarked tile. Only a human looking at pixels caught it.

So this gate asserts the thing that was actually decidable in advance and
never written down: WHICH HOSTS ARE WE ALLOWED TO PROXY, AND WHY. Each entry
below carries its licence and its usage policy in prose. Adding a host means
writing that paragraph, which is the review step that would have caught the
change of terms, because it forces somebody to go read them.

WHAT IT ASSERTS.
  1. Every external URL in the router points at an allowlisted host. Scanned
     out of the source rather than read off the imported constants, so a new
     constant added later is caught too. A test that reads the four names it
     already knows about cannot notice a fifth.
  2. No upstream URL carries an API key, token or access parameter. A keyless
     service that starts needing credentials must fail loudly here rather
     than quietly in the pixels.
  3. The hosts we deliberately refuse stay refused, with the reason recorded.
  4. The vendored MapLibre styles contain no external URL at all. A style JSON
     names the URLs the browser goes on to fetch: the vector source, the
     relief raster, the glyph template and the sprite base. If any one keeps
     its upstream host, the browser talks to that host directly and the map
     still renders, so the leak is invisible on screen.
