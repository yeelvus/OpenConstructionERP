"""An agreement between the two working-week registries only counts when both sides answered.

Two registries answer "which days does this country work":

* ``core.calendar._WORKING_WEEK``, keyed by ISO country code.
* ``schedule.service``, reached through ``get_work_calendar``, keyed by a project's
  free-text region and resolved through several paths.

Both substitute silently for a country they do not carry. ``get_work_calendar``
returns ``WORK_CALENDARS["DEFAULT"]``, a Monday-Friday week, and
``core.calendar.is_working_day`` reads ``_WORKING_WEEK.get(cc, _DEFAULT_WORKING_WEEK)``
and answers Monday-Friday with no holidays. Neither says it has done so.

**Why that makes an agreement untrustworthy and a difference trustworthy.** A
difference is a positive result: something had to be computed on both sides for the
two answers to come out unequal. An agreement is the *absence* of a computed
difference, and an absence has two causes. The systems agree, or nothing was
measured. Take any country neither registry carries and any weekend date: both
return "not working", a comparison prints "agree", and nothing whatsoever has been
established.

So a comparison of these two registries has three outcomes, not two, and this file
exists to keep the third one visible:

    comparable   both sides resolved a real entry; agree or differ both mean something
    unmeasured   at least one side substituted; neither agreement nor disagreement
    absent       the country is in neither registry; out of scope here

**Why resolution is proved by identity and never by a label.** The fallback calendar
is a complete, confident dict with a plausible label. Reading the label is how a
first pass at this measurement reported Nigeria as a genuine difference: the value
looked like an answer because it *is* an answer, just not that country's. Identity
against the ``DEFAULT`` object is the only cheap proof that a lookup found something.
``test_no_country_resolves_to_the_default_calendar_object`` guards the premise that
makes identity valid.

**Why the resolver is asked rather than the country map read.** ``get_work_calendar``
resolves a calendar key before it consults ``_CALENDAR_BY_COUNTRY``, so a code that is
also a calendar key resolves without appearing in that map. Reading the map and
reading the resolver give different answers, and only one of them is what the product
does. Every check below asks the resolver.

**Boundary with the neighbouring gate.**
``test_work_calendar_rest_days_do_not_conflict.py`` asks whether a *misplaced rest
day* can exist, and correctly skips countries whose week is Monday-Friday, because
the Monday-Friday fallback cannot put the weekend on the wrong days for them. That
skip is right for that question and it is exactly the population this file is about:
a country whose week is Monday-Friday on one side and absent on the other is the case
where a fallback is invisible to every existing check.
