// Case: "Keep a court-proof Bautagebuch" (DE).
//
// The German site day written as evidence: weather pulled from an independent
// service, the Behinderung logged at the hour it starts, the notice served
// under VOB/B, the crew hours booked before anyone leaves site, the day closed
// and signed so its contents are frozen. Two years later the pack assembles
// itself. Content strings are key plus inline English default and live here.

Nobody wants to write up the week on a Friday evening, so this case puts every entry where the work is: the diary as the day runs, the Behinderung at the hour it starts, the notice served under VOB/B, the hours booked before the gate closes, and the day signed and sealed.",
