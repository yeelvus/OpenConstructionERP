"""Boot-path data repairs - the half of a migration the schema heal cannot do.

What this exists for
--------------------
The product does not run ``alembic upgrade``. The schema moves at boot through
:func:`app.core.postgres_migrator.postgres_auto_migrate`, which adds sequences,
columns, indexes and constraints, plus ``Base.metadata.create_all``, which
creates whole missing tables. Between them they cover every *additive schema*
revision and nothing else. A revision whose ``upgrade()`` body rewrites rows -
a backfill, a rename, a de-duplication - passes straight through: its statements
are never executed on any install brought up the normal way, while
``stamp_head_if_unstamped`` records the database at head.

That combination is the defect this module answers. Not "the rewrite did not
run", which would at least be discoverable, but "the rewrite did not run *and*
the version table says it did". Nothing downstream ever looks again.

What this is, and what it deliberately is not
---------------------------------------------
This is a registry of **human-authored** repairs that run on the boot path. Each
entry is code somebody wrote, read and decided to run against customer data.

Modules register their own repairs. There is no list in this file: a module
puts a ``repairs.py`` beside its ``models.py``, builds a :class:`DataRepair` and
hands it to :func:`register_data_repair`, and :func:`discover_data_repairs`
imports the lot on the boot path. A central list would be a single file every
author has to edit, and two authors editing it at once lose each other's entry
in a way ``git status`` cannot show, because the file was already modified. The
entry that goes missing is a repair that then never runs.

Every repair has to say which of three natures it has, and the distinction is
not paperwork. ``always_wrong`` corrects a value that was never right - a
trademarked catalogue name, a missing label - and may overwrite it in place.
``superseded`` corrects a value that was right until a date and wrong after it -
a tax rate the legislature changed - and may **not** overwrite it, because an
invoice issued at the old rate has to keep reading at the old rate. That kind
declares :class:`SupersededBy`, and :func:`verify_supersede_shape` checks its
actual effect on the table against that declaration, so the difference is
enforced rather than described.

``never_delivered`` is the third, and it corrects no value at all. The row is
missing: a shipped seed file grew a row in a later release, and every seeder in
this codebase fills a table only while it is empty, so a database seeded before
that release never received the row and never will. Such a repair inserts and
touches nothing that is already there; it declares :class:`NeverDelivered` and
:func:`verify_additive_shape` holds it to that.

The whole difficulty of the third kind is the word "never". A row that is not
there was either never delivered or delivered and deleted, and the table cannot
tell you which, so a repair that guesses wrong puts a deliberately deleted row
back on every boot for the life of the install. :class:`DataRepairDelivery` is
what makes the answer a record rather than an inference, and it is the one
thing in this module that is read in order to decide - see its docstring for
why that is the opposite of what the ledger below must never do.

It is **not** a mechanism that replays revision bodies. That was considered and
rejected, and the reasons are worth keeping next to the code so the idea is not
re-proposed as an obvious improvement:

* The desktop bundle ships no migration tree at all (``desktop/pyinstaller.spec``
  bundles ``app``, ``locales`` and the frontend, and neither ``alembic/`` nor
  ``alembic.ini``), so on the largest install route there is nothing to replay.
* The revision tree cannot be run standalone anyway: revisions inspect tables
  that ``create_all`` creates, which ``tests/integration/test_migrations_roundtrip.py``
  documents at the top of its own docstring.
* A rewrite against customer data needs judgement that machinery does not have.
  ``v3271_formwork_debrand`` declines to touch a tenant that already holds the
  replacement row, because deciding which of two rows an existing assignment
  should follow is a call about somebody else's data. A generic replayer would
  have no place to put that decision.

So: revisions stay the record for operators who run alembic by hand, and a
repair that has to reach everybody else is written here as well. The cost is
that such a repair is written twice. The gate at
``scripts/check_data_rewrite_boot_repair.py`` is what makes the second half
non-optional, by refusing a revision that rewrites rows unless its file says
where the boot-path half lives - or says, in words, why it does not need one.

The ledger is a RECORD and never a GATE
---------------------------------------
:class:`DataRepairLedger` records what ran, when, and how many rows moved. It is
never consulted to decide whether a repair should run. Every repair runs on
every boot.

This is the whole point, so it is worth being blunt about it: a table that is
allowed to answer "already done" is ``alembic_version``, and ``alembic_version``
saying "done" over data that was never rewritten is the bug this module exists
because of. Rebuilding that shape one directory over would be an odd way to fix
it. Running every time also means a database restored from a backup taken before
the repair is repaired again, which a run-once ledger would silently skip.

:class:`DataRepairDelivery` is not an exception to that and reading it as one
would be the wrong lesson. It is keyed on the ROW rather than on the repair, so
it never answers "already done" for a repair; it answers "this database has
already been offered this row", which the customer may then have deleted. The
repair still runs on every boot, still looks at every row, and still repairs a
restored backup, because a backup old enough to be missing the rows is missing
the delivery records too.

The property that makes this affordable is idempotence, and it is a requirement
on every entry, not a hope: :class:`DataRepair` is where that contract is
written down, and ``tests/pg/test_data_repairs.py`` holds it for the repairs
registered today by running each one twice and asserting the second pass
changes nothing.

Silence
-------
A repair that fails is logged at ERROR with its id and its exception, and the
boot path publishes ``data_repairs_failed`` on ``/api/health`` beside
``schema_heal_failed``. A ledger write that fails is logged at ERROR too and
published beside them as ``data_repair_ledger_failed``, separately and for the
reason :class:`DataRepairReport` gives: the query below is the only answer to
"did this repair run here", and an install that had quietly stopped being able
to write it reported ``healthy``.

A module whose ``repairs.py`` cannot be imported is the third way this pass can
come out wrong, and for a while it was the quietest. Discovery logged the
import error and carried on, so the repair simply was not in the registry, the
report had no outcome for it, and every published field answered exactly as it
does for a pass where nothing was wrong: ``data_repairs_failed: false``,
``data_repair_ledger_failed: false``, status ``healthy``. A module broken badly
enough not to load at all was the *most* reassuring answer the endpoint could
give. :class:`DataRepairDiscoveryFailure` is what makes it sayable:
:func:`discover_data_repairs` records every module it could not import,
:attr:`DataRepairReport.discovery_failures` carries them out of the pass, and
:func:`app.main.publish_data_repair_verdict` turns them into
``data_repairs_failed: true``. A repair that did not run is now reported as a
repair that did not run.

A repair that runs and changes nothing is the ordinary case and stays at DEBUG;
a repair that runs and *changes rows* is logged at INFO with the count, because
on an upgraded install that line is the only contemporaneous evidence that the
customer's data was altered.

Reading the ledger on a live install::

    SELECT repair_id, last_outcome, runs, rows_changed_total, updated_at
      FROM oe_data_repair_ledger ORDER BY repair_id;

That query is the answer to "did this install ever carry the branded rows"
after the fact, and it is the only such answer that exists: there is no
telemetry in this product and no install identifier, so the affected population
cannot be counted centrally and never could be.

    The ledger answers "did this repair run here". That must never gate,
    because a database restored from a backup taken before the repair needs
    repairing again, and a run-once marker would skip it.

    This table answers a different question: "was this particular row ever
    handed to this database". That is the one fact separating a row that never
    arrived from a row that arrived and the customer deleted, and both look
    identical in the target table because in both the row is simply not there.

    The backup argument that makes the ledger a record makes this one a gate,

    same database as the rows it describes, so a backup carries both or
    neither: restore from before the repair and the delivery rows are gone too,
    the repair correctly delivers again, and nothing has desynced. A ledger
    keyed on the repair rather than on the row cannot do that, because the

    The write is the repair's own, in the repair's own session, so the rows and

    ``tests/pg/test_data_repairs.py`` runs that check over every registered
    repair. A repair that declares itself ``superseded`` and then overwrites a
    value column fails the registry's own contract test.

    The check is structural rather than domain-specific on purpose. Asking each
    consumer for a "what did this resolve to on date D" probe would mean every
    future author has to build a resolver before they can register a repair,
    and most repairs have no resolver to borrow. The shape is enough: if no
    pre-existing row's value columns changed, and the only edit to an existing
    row was closing its open validity window, then no already-issued document
    can have changed value, whatever the domain.

    Attributes:
        effective_from: ISO date on which the new value takes effect. Recorded

        closes_column: The column that ends a row's validity window -
            ``effective_to`` for a tax rate. The check permits a pre-existing
            row to change here, and only from empty to set. A row that already
            carried a closing date may not have it moved: that would re-open or
            re-close a window somebody set by hand.
        also_updates: Further columns the repair is allowed to change on a
            pre-existing row. Empty by default, and it should stay empty
            wherever it can: every name added here is a hole in the contract.

            document's value** - a selection hint or a display flag - and write

            the date a document was priced on can never go in this list.

            The case that produced it: closing Romania's 19 % row also has to
            move ``is_default`` off it, because a rate whose window has ended
            cannot go on being the one the UI offers first. That flips a column
            on a pre-existing row and is still safe, since no invoice's value
            depends on which rate is offered first. The registry's contract
            test found that edit on its first run, which is the argument for
            declaring the allowance rather than loosening the check.

    create tables, in which case the data is correct and the *record* of it is
    missing. Those are different failures and collapsing them would let the
    smaller one hide the larger.

    Reporting them separately only helps if both halves are then published,
    and for a while only one of them was: the boot path read ``failed`` and
    dropped this flag, so a database with no ledger table repaired its rows,
    lost the record, and answered ``healthy``. Both now go across in
    :func:`app.main.publish_data_repair_verdict`, which is the only writer of
    either, so a field added here and left unpublished is a change to one
    function rather than something nobody notices.

    ``discovery_failures`` is the third thing that has to travel, and it is the
    one that cannot be derived from the other two. ``failed`` is read off the
    outcomes, so it can only ever name a repair that RAN. A repair whose module
    did not import produced no outcome at all, which reads back through every
    property here as a pass with nothing wrong in it. This field is the only
    place that difference survives.
