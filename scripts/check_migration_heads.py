"""Fail if the Alembic revision graph has more than one head.

Written the day three agents added a revision each in parallel and two of them
chained off the same parent. Every one of them checked ``alembic heads`` inside
its own task and every one of them truthfully reported a single head, because
each ran before the others had written their file. The fork was only visible to
someone looking at all three at once, which is exactly the kind of thing a gate
should be doing instead of a person.

A second head is not a cosmetic problem. ``alembic upgrade head`` refuses to
run against an ambiguous head, so the fork is discovered by whoever upgrades
first, which on a release is the user.

Why this reads the files instead of asking Alembic
--------------------------------------------------
``ScriptDirectory`` would answer the same question and would answer it more
authoritatively. It also imports the Alembic and SQLAlchemy stack, which on at
least one developer machine here wedges for minutes on an unrelated Windows
management call during ``import sqlalchemy``. A gate that hangs is a gate people
disable. This one reads text and needs no database, no driver and no config.

The cost of that choice is that the parser has to be right, and the first draft
was not: it read ``down_revision`` with a single-line regex, so every merge
revision whose parents are a tuple spread over several lines lost its parents
and was counted as a base. It reported 43 heads and 18 bases. The heads number
looked alarming but plausible; the bases number is what gave it away, because an
Alembic graph has exactly one base. That is why this script prints bases and
edge counts rather than only the answer it was asked for: the number that
refutes a broken scan is usually not the number you were looking at.
