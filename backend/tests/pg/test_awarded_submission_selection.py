"""PG: which submission an award refers to, when a bidder has more than one.

A bidder can hold several submissions in one package. ``BidSubmission``
constrains ``invitation_id`` to be unique but not ``bidder_id``, nothing forbids
inviting the same company twice, and ``record_submission`` checks only that the
bidder and the invitation agree about the package. A revised round produces
exactly this shape through the ordinary API.

Two subscribers of ``bid_management.package.awarded`` read that submission and
used to pick differently. The contract subscriber read an unbounded query with
``scalar_one_or_none``, which raises on two rows, and its handler-wide
``except Exception`` swallowed the failure at debug level: the award created no
contract and reported nothing.

These tests must run against a real database. The fake session in
``tests/unit/test_procurement_events.py`` models neither ``order_by`` nor
``limit``, and its ``scalar_one_or_none`` returns the first row where SQLAlchemy
raises, so under that double both the defect and the fix are invisible.

Gated by ``OE_TEST_DB=pg`` (see conftest).
