"""The date arithmetic every funding deadline is derived from.

These three functions decide when a report is due, how long money may sit
unspent, and when vouchers may be destroyed. Each of those dates is told to a
person who then plans around it, so an off-by-one here is not a rounding
error, it is a missed deadline with money attached.
