"""Fail if the desktop application window cannot reach the commands it invokes.

The launcher serves the application from the backend it starts, and navigates
the webview to ``http://127.0.0.1:<port>/``. Tauri calls that a REMOTE origin:
``Webview::is_local_url`` counts only the Tauri custom protocol and a
``frontendDist`` that is a URL, and this build's ``frontendDist`` is a
directory. A remote origin then hits the branch in ``webview/mod.rs`` that
reads ``if (plugin_command.is_some() || has_app_acl_manifest || !is_local) &&
invoke.acl.is_none()`` and rejects the call.

That is not a hypothetical. Before the ``permissions`` directory and the
``app-window`` capability existed, the application declared no ACL of its own,
no capability named the loopback origin, and so every ``#[tauri::command]``
invoked from the application window was refused. The user-visible shape of it
was that every outbound link in the product - the docs, the repository, the
marketing site, contact mail - did nothing at all when clicked. No error, no
browser, nothing, because the frontend swallowed the rejection.

Four things have to stay true for that to stay fixed, and this gate checks all
four.

Everything the application page invokes has to be reachable from it
-------------------------------------------------------------------
A capability with a ``remote`` block has to exist, its URL patterns have to
actually cover the address the launcher navigates to, and the permissions it
names have to resolve to every command the page calls. Checking that the file
merely contains the string ``http://127.0.0.1:*`` would pass a file where
somebody renamed the permission and severed the grant, so the check resolves
the permission set for real and matches the pattern against sample addresses.

Each command is checked on its own, because a grant that covers one says
nothing about the rest and the failure looks identical from the outside: a
control that is on screen, is enabled, and does nothing when pressed.

Nothing else may go dead the same way
-------------------------------------
Declaring an application ACL at all flips ``has_app_acl_manifest`` true, which
turns on the same check for the LOCAL origin, where app commands used to be
unrestricted. So every command in ``generate_handler!`` now needs a grant from
some capability or it is dead on both origins with nothing on screen to say so.
Adding a command and forgetting its permission is a silent regression of
exactly the shape this file exists to close, so it fails here instead.

The capability files have to be the whole answer
------------------------------------------------
Tauri's ``dynamic-acl`` feature is in its own default feature list, so
``Manager::add_capability`` is compiled into this build without us asking for
it. A capability granted that way lasts for the life of the process and is
recorded in no file, so ``capabilities/`` would go on describing a narrower
application than the one that runs. What makes that worth a check rather than a
note is that the reassuring version of it - we do not call it - is exactly the
kind of statement that gets written down once and quietly stops being true.

Nothing may hand a link to something that re-parses it
------------------------------------------------------
Opening a link on Windows used to run ``cmd /c start "" "<target>"``, so the
address became part of a command line that cmd.exe re-parsed. Quoting held off
the separators, but cmd expands ``%NAME%`` inside double quotes as readily as
outside. Measured: ``%USERNAME%`` became the account name and ``%CD%`` became
the full path of the working directory, both sent to whatever host the link
named. It is now ``ShellExecuteW`` with the target as one argument.

This check is deliberately NOT "have the three helpers that used to do the
quoting come back". They are deleted, so the compiler already refuses calls to
them, but the compiler has nothing to say about a fresh ``Command::new("cmd")``
written under a fourth name, and a guard keyed to a helper stops protecting the
moment somebody adds a second caller. So the question asked here is a property
of the path instead: does anything in the Windows link-opening path construct a
process at all, and does anything anywhere in the crate start a program that
re-parses what it is given.

It reads the source rather than the call graph, so it cannot follow a process
construction into a helper the opener calls. What it can do, and does, is fail
when the set of opener functions it knows about stops matching what is in the
file, which is the moment its own scope has gone stale.

The pattern matcher below is a deliberately narrow subset of the URLPattern
standard that Tauri actually uses, so it self-tests before every scan against
cases measured against the real ``tauri_utils::acl::RemoteUrlPattern``. A
matcher that quietly stopped matching would make this gate vacuously green.

The same reasoning applies to every check here and is worth stating once. A
proof that plants a defect has to check the defect actually landed, or its
silence is indistinguishable from its success. The proof for the opener change
first reported "found 0 sites to plant" because ``main.rs`` is a CRLF file and
the planted literals were not; had it asserted only that the tests went red it
would have said nothing while looking like it ran. Every scan below therefore
asserts on what it found before drawing a conclusion from what it did not.
