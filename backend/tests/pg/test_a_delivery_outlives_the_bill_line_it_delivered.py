"""A delivery record survives the deletion of the bill position it delivered.

This is the site-logistics module's orphan discipline, and it is enforced by the
database rather than by a sweep: ``oe_site_logistics_delivery_line`` holds a
real foreign key to ``oe_boq_position`` declared ``ON DELETE SET NULL``. The
schedule module, whose links live in a JSON array, needs
``BOQService._scrub_activity_position_refs`` to walk the activities and remove
dead ids by hand; a foreign key is maintained inside the delete transaction.

An untested ``SET NULL`` is an assumption, not a discipline - so this exercises
the real DDL on real PostgreSQL:

* the delivery and its line survive a deleted position,
* the line keeps the snapshot that says what arrived,
* the line no longer counts as covering anything, and is reported as detached.

PG lane only (``OE_TEST_DB=pg``).
