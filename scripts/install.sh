# OpenConstructionERP - One-Line Installer for Linux / macOS
#
# Usage:
#   curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datadrivenconstruction/OpenConstructionERP/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
#
# What it does:
#   1. If Docker is installed → runs via docker compose
#   2. If Python 3.12+ is installed → installs via pip/uv
#   3. Otherwise → installs uv (which manages Python) → installs via uv
#
# Environment variables:
#   OE_VERSION     - Version to install (default: latest)
#   OE_INSTALL_DIR - Installation directory (default: ~/.openconstructionerp)
#   OE_METHOD      - Force method: docker, pip, uv (default: auto-detect)
#   OE_PORT        - Port to run on (default: 8080)

# the one character that would break the connection URL the stack builds from
# this password: a URL splits its user info at the first "@", so a literal one
# moves the rest of the password into the host. It can emit "/", roughly four
# times in ten, and that is fine, because the parser splits the authority on
# the last "@" and a slash before it changes nothing.

# `docker compose up` stops on an interpolation error and starts nothing,
# which is what this installer did for everyone who had Docker.
#
# The check is per key, not per file. A .env holding one of the two is a state
# a reader reaches easily, since the recipe in the README is two separate
# lines, and a plain "the file is there, leave it alone" test would keep the
