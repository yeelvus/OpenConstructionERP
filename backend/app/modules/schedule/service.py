# ── Regional work calendar configuration ─────────────────────────────────
# Each entry defines hours_per_day, work_days (weekday indices) and label.
# There are no holidays here and never have been: compute_duration counts
# every non-weekend day as a working day, for every region in this table.
# weekday(): Monday=0, Tuesday=1, ... Saturday=5, Sunday=6
#
# WHAT THIS TABLE IS. The week the planner schedules against, which is not the
# same question as the week a statute describes. core.calendar._WORKING_WEEK
# answers that other question. A planning week may deliberately be LONGER than
# the statutory one, which is why Brazil, China and India plan six days on top
# of a five-day statutory week. It may never be shorter, because removing a day
# the country works puts every computed date on the wrong side of the weekend.
# The gate is tests/unit/test_work_calendar_rest_days_do_not_conflict.py, and
# its module docstring is the long form of this paragraph.
#
# WHAT CONSULTS IT, measured rather than assumed. get_work_calendar is the only
# reader that computes a date, and it is reached from two places that do not
# behave the same way:
#
#   * BOQ schedule generation resolves it from project.region, so a project's
#     region really does select its calendar there.
#   * compute_duration takes a region argument, and no caller anywhere passes
#     one. Every call site supplies two arguments, so get_work_calendar(None)
#     returns DEFAULT and compute_duration is Monday-Friday for every project
#     in every region. The parameter works; nothing gives it a value.
#
# core.country_coverage reads this table as well, but as a coverage probe, and
# it deliberately answers through the resolver rather than off the table: the
# keys are a mixed vocabulary rather than country codes, so reading them
# directly gives the wrong answer. It computes no dates.
#
# So the same project can be given a six-day duration by BOQ generation and a
# five-day one as soon as anything recomputes it: create_activity always,
# update_activity whenever the payload carries a start or end date, and
# get_gantt_data as a fallback when the stored duration is zero. Nothing
# exempts a BOQ-generated row from that, so a Chinese project's duration
# changes the first time someone drags one of its dates. Do not read an entry
# below as "this is what the product does for that country" until you know
# which of the paths produced the number in front of you.
#
# WHERE EACH WEEK CAME FROM is recorded per entry. An entry with no note is
# one whose source was never recorded, and that is worth knowing as such.

    This is worth knowing before threading a region through. BOQ schedule

    five. Passing a region would make those durations agree at six days; leaving
    it unset would make them agree at five. Both change dates that shipped demo
