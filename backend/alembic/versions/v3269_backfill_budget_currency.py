"""Backfill oe_finance_budget.currency_code from the owning project.

``ProjectBudget.currency_code`` carries no DB default in the model on purpose.
``finance/models.py`` states the contract: service code MUST supply the
currency from the project context so per-project rollups do not silently bias
toward one currency. Four write paths ignored that contract - the demo seeder,
the ``estimate.approved`` and ``variation.approved`` event handlers, and
create-budget-from-BOQ - and every line they wrote landed with ``''``. The
finance table renders those as em-dashes instead of money. The write paths are
fixed; this revision repairs the rows they already wrote.

Why this is safe to run over customer data:

* **Only empty or NULL rows are touched.** A row that already carries a
  currency is never rewritten, whatever its value. That is what makes the
  migration safe for a self-hosted install whose budget lines were imported
  rather than seeded: an imported row carrying a real currency is not empty,
  so it is not considered.
* **A row whose project currency has since changed still has no currency of
  its own today.** The project's current value is the best answer available
  and is strictly better than blank.
* **Nothing is invented.** When the parent project's own currency is blank,
  the budget row stays blank. That is the honest outcome. In particular this
  revision never writes a hardcoded currency of any kind.
* **Idempotent.** The predicate stops matching once a row is filled, so a
  second run updates zero rows.

The length guard is not cosmetic. ``oe_projects_project.currency`` is
``String(10)`` while ``oe_finance_budget.currency_code`` is ``String(3)``, so
copying a longer value across would abort the migration with "value too long
for type character varying(3)". Rows whose project currency does not fit an
ISO 4217 alphabetic code are left blank rather than truncated, because half a
currency code is worse than none. ``UPPER`` is normalisation, not invention:
ISO 4217 alphabetic codes are uppercase by definition and the application's
own writers already normalise with ``.strip()[:3].upper()``.

One thing found while writing this, worth knowing but deliberately not
"fixed" here. ``v2916_project_budget_currency`` added this column with
``server_default="EUR"``, while the model declares ``server_default=""``. So
the two install paths disagree: an install already stamped below v2916 that
upgraded through it had ``EUR`` applied to every budget row existing at that
moment, and a database built by ``create_all`` gives ``''``. A fresh install
is unaffected either way, since it never walks that revision. This revision
cannot repair the upgraded case,
because a row reading ``EUR`` because a migration stamped it is
indistinguishable from a row a user set to EUR. That is a separate decision
and is reported rather than acted on.
