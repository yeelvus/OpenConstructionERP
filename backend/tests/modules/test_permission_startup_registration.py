"""A real application boot is what has to register these permission keys.

Both modules covered here gate a route on a permission key that only exists
because the package's ``on_startup`` hook put it there. The module loader
auto-imports ``router``, ``models``, ``hooks``, ``events``, ``validators`` and
``pipeline_nodes``; it never imports ``permissions.py``. The single path from a
``permissions.py`` to a running registry is ``__init__.on_startup``, which
``module_loader.py:352-355`` reaches with ``getattr(package, "on_startup")``.

The failure this closes is silent, and it is the one the whole fix exists to
prevent. ``RequirePermission`` denies a key nobody registered, and the admin
role short-circuits above that check, so an unregistered key produces a route
that behaves exactly like a correct admin-only route. Every test that
authenticates as an admin stays green. The route is simply undelegatable
forever, because ``set_min_role`` raises ``KeyError`` on a key the registry
does not know, so the admin permission matrix cannot hand it to anyone.

Unregistering first is what makes the answer mean anything. Both registration
functions are importable, and any test process that touched the module has
almost certainly run them as a side effect. Asserting the keys are present
after an import proves the function works; it says nothing about whether the
application calls it. So this empties both modules out of the registry, asserts
the emptying actually took, boots the app the way production boots it, and only
then asks what came back.

One file and one boot for two modules on purpose: the fixture is the expensive
part, and the assertion is the same mechanism in both cases.
