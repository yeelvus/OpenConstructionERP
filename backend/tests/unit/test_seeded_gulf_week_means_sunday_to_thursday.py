"""The seeded Gulf week must *mean* Sunday to Thursday, not merely be legal ISO.

How this differs from the two guards beside it, so neither gets deleted as a
duplicate of the other:

* ``test_work_calendar_weekdays_are_iso.py`` is a **range** guard. It asserts
  every value in the seed file, the write schemas and the v3303 migration falls
  inside 1..7. It would pass unchanged if Saudi Arabia were seeded
  ``[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`` - perfectly legal ISO, and the wrong week.
* ``test_work_calendar_weekdays_are_mon0.py`` is the same range guard pointed at
  the platform's other axis, where the mistake is a 7 rather than a 0.
* This file is a **meaning** guard, and it is the only one of the three that
  runs the numbers against real dates. It asks what the seeded row does to a
  Sunday and to a Friday.

Why that shape and not "Saudi Arabia has five working days". Both readings of
``[7, 1, 2, 3, 4]`` are five days long. Read on the ISO axis it is Sunday to
Thursday, which is correct; read on the Monday-zero axis the 7 matches nothing
(``date.weekday()`` tops out at 6), Sunday leaves the week and Friday joins it,
and the count is four. A cardinality assertion passes under both and proves
nothing, which is exactly how the original defect survived review: the shipped
row was ``[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]``, five entries, and ``isoweekday()`` never returns 0,
so Saudi Arabia quietly ran a four-day week until ``v3303_work_calendar_iso_
weekdays`` repaired it. Sunday and Friday are the two days that tell the axes
apart, so they are what this file asserts on.

``test_control_the_same_row_read_on_the_monday_zero_axis_inverts_it`` is a
deliberate negative control, not a defect: it feeds the seeded list to a
``date.weekday()`` matcher and shows the week come back inverted. Without it the
assertions above would pass over any row at all and this file would be vacuous.
