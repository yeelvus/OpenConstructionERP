"""The E57 refusal must not tell a desktop user to run pip.

This message is different in kind from the ones in ``doctor``. It is a response
detail an ordinary user reads after opening a scan, not a line an operator finds
in a diagnostic report, and the desktop build has no pip for them to act on it
with: ``sys.executable`` is the app binary, so the command feeds its own tokens
back into this application's CLI.

It is also reachable, which is what separates it from the rest of the family.
The ``pointcloud`` extra is ``pye57``, and ``pye57`` is not in
``requirements-desktop.lock``, so LAS, LAZ and COPC open in the bundle and E57
lands here every time. That is why the frozen answer is DESKTOP_NO_EXTRA rather
than the repair wording: the bundle is lean, not damaged.
