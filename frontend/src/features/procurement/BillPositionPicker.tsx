/**
 * Attach a purchase-order line to the bill position it is being bought for.
 *
 * The buyer sees bill positions and never a cost line. What comes back out of
 * this control is a `boq_position_id`, which the server resolves to the cost
 * line when the order line is written; deriving the money link is our job, not
 * theirs. See `backend/app/modules/procurement/cost_spine.py`.
 *
 * Renders nothing at all when the project's cost spine is empty. That is the
 * ordinary state of a project that has never generated one, and an empty
 * dropdown with an explanation under it would put a permanent piece of
 * furniture on the order form for a choice that cannot be made. The same
 * silence covers the case where the cost model module is not installed, since
 * a plugin that is not there answers nothing rather than answering zero.
 *
 * Searching goes to the server. A bill can hold thousands of positions against
 * a page of two hundred, and a filter that could only see the loaded page would
 * tell a buyer their position does not exist while the register holds it. Three
 * consequences follow and each is deliberate:
 *
 * Whether to render at all is decided by the unsearched list and never by the
 * current results, so a search that matches nothing leaves the control in place
 * to be corrected instead of making it vanish mid-keystroke.
 *
 * The unsearched list is one page and may be partial, so it says so rather than
 * presenting itself as the whole register.
 *
 * The current selection is fetched by its own id when the page does not contain
 * it. A control that cannot find its own value renders as unselected, and the
 * next save would write that back, which is the quiet way an attribution made
 * months ago disappears.
