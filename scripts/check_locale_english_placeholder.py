"""Locale gate: fail a locale file that is still mostly English placeholder.

The Hungarian bundle was assembled and passed every locale gate this repository
has while 30746 of its 41903 values were byte-identical to their English source.
Not partially translated: the same bytes, because `scripts/i18n_new_locale.py
extract` seeds every batch value with the English text as the translator's
starting point, and a batch nobody ever opened is indistinguishable from a
finished one. `assemble` and `verify` both check the shape of the key set -
non-empty, matches _order.json, no key in two batches - and neither of them
looks at what language a value is written in. `tsc -b` and `npm run build` were
green on the file, because English in a Hungarian bundle is valid TypeScript.

This is not a second copy of scripts/check_i18n_leak_baseline.py and must not be
folded into it. That guard runs down the key axis: for one key, how many of the
locales answer it with the English string, flagging at 24 of 28 because a leak
copies one string into every locale at once. A single locale that is 74% English
never reaches that count in any locale-set, so it is invisible there, and it has
to be, or the two lists that guard would need would have to carry 30000 keys.
This guard runs down the other axis: for one locale, how much of the whole
corpus is English. Neither axis sees what the other sees, and a consolidation
would silently drop one of them.

Population. Each value is compared against its RESOLVED English source, the same
english_sources() the extraction tool uses, not against en.ts. en.ts answers
about 36000 keys while the corpus is about 43500: English is supplied inline at
the call site as t('key', { defaultValue: 'English' }), through <Trans defaults>,
and as the English field beside a key field in the case playbooks and the module
guides. A check that knew only en.ts would quietly excuse some 7700 keys, and it
would report a clean verdict while doing it. So the numbers are printed beside
the verdict: keys in the file, keys actually compared, and keys excluded because
nothing in the tree says what their English is. A green line whose compared
column is far below its keys column is not a pass, it is a narrow question, and
POPULATION_FLOOR below turns that into a failure rather than leaving it to a
reader to notice.

English and its regional variants are the one thing this guard does not ask
about, for the reason in is_english_variant(): a value in en-US that agrees with
en.ts agrees on purpose, so the question is meaningless there rather than
merely passing. The report names the files it skipped on that ground.

#
# Measured on 2026-09-02 across the 42 non-English locale files in the tree, all
# of them shipped and in use. The whole finished population lies between 0.65%
# (fa, he) and 3.72% (fr); the cluster at the top is exactly what you would
# expect it to be, the languages that share the most vocabulary and the most
# proper nouns with English (fr 3.72, nl 3.56, da 3.40, id 3.12). Hungarian
# assembled from untouched batches measured 74.01%. There is no locale anywhere
# between 3.72% and 74.01%, so the line is not being drawn through a crowd.
#
# 10% sits about 2.7x above the highest finished locale, and the distance from
# fr to the threshold (6.3 points) is twice the entire spread of the finished
# population (3.07 points), so a new language with more untranslatable terms
# than any language we currently ship still has room. In the units of the defect
# it exists to catch: the corpus is around 41000 keys and extract writes batches
# of about 1000, so 10% is roughly three untouched batches above the ordinary
# baseline. Fewer than three untouched batches is not what this gate is for -
# individual leaked keys are the key-axis guard's job, described above.

# Keys carrying a resolvable, non-blank English source, as a share of the keys

# denominator that quietly shrinks is how the defect above survived: a check
# that examines 300 keys of 41903 and calls them all translated prints exactly
# the same "OK" as one that examines all of them. Every locale in the tree on
# 2026-09-02 was above 99.1%, so the floor costs nothing today; what it buys is
# that a regression in english_sources() fails here instead of turning the gate
# green by giving it less to look at.
