"""Retention held on a contract, worked out from its policy. Pure, no I/O.

Retention used to be one flat rate, ``Contract.retention_percent``, applied in
two places that disagreed as soon as the rate could change: each claim accrued
``period gross × rate`` and the continuation sheet printed ``current rate ×
work to date`` in column I. A policy that steps down at half complete breaks
that at once, so this module is the one place that says how much retention a
contract holds, and every figure is derived from it:

* :func:`compute_retention` takes work completed to date and stored materials
  per SoV line plus the contract sum, and returns what is held on work (G702
  line 5a), on stored materials (5b) and per line (G703 column I), with the
  line figures summing exactly to the totals.
* :func:`plan_release` says what an event such as substantial completion
  releases, as a percentage of what is held at that event.
* :func:`step_down_release` says what a recompute-mode rate reduction frees.

Two tier modes exist because contracts write both. **Prospective**: each band
of work is retained at the rate of the tier it fell in, so crossing 50% moves
only the work after the threshold to the lower rate and nothing already held
comes back. The figure depends only on how much work is complete, never on
how many claims it took to get there. **Recompute**: the current tier's rate
applies to all work to date, so crossing the threshold lowers what should be
held, and the difference is released as a ``rate_step_down`` that needs the
documents the pack lists (in the US, the surety's consent where there is a
bond). The founder decision of 22.09 makes prospective the default.

Percent complete is work completed over the contract sum to date, without
stored materials: a threshold such as "50% complete" is about the work, and
counting materials sitting on site would step the rate down before half the
work is done.
