"""Workspace white-label branding API (issue #272).

Branding used to live only in the browser's localStorage, so it never followed
the workspace to another browser or to an invited user's first (pre-auth) view
of the login page. These endpoints persist it once on the server:

    GET    /api/v1/branding/   - PUBLIC. The login page reads it before anyone
                                 signs in, so an invited user sees the workspace
                                 brand on the very first screen.
    PUT    /api/v1/branding/   - admin only. Set the workspace brand.
    DELETE /api/v1/branding/   - admin only. Clear it and revert to default.

    GET    /api/v1/document-appearance/ - any signed-in user. The settings
                                 page reads it; unlike the brand it is never
                                 needed before sign-in, so it is not public.
    PUT    /api/v1/document-appearance/ - admin only. Set how exports look.
    DELETE /api/v1/document-appearance/ - admin only. Back to the platform look.

Persistence is a small JSON file in the data dir (see
:mod:`app.core.app_branding` and :mod:`app.core.pdf_appearance`) - no database
table, so this needs no migration.

The appearance endpoints live here rather than in a router of their own because
they are the same concern seen from two sides: the brand says whose document it
is, the appearance says what it looks like, and both are read by the same PDF
layer. One mount, one place to look.
