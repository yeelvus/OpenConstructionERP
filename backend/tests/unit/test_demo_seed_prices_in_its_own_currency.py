"""The demo seed must not print one price under every currency code.

Three blocks in ``demo_projects`` are written once and reused by all thirty-one
packs: the assembly recipes, the plant rates and the resource pool. Their
numbers are euro figures, and they used to be written verbatim whatever the
template said. A square metre of plaster and paint came out at 42.30 in Berlin,
in Sao Paulo, in Delhi and in Dubai, with only the currency code changing, so
the catalogue quietly claimed that a euro, a real and a rupee buy the same
amount of building.

``_DEMO_COST_LEVEL`` fixes that, and these hold it up. Note what the fix is not:
it is not an exchange rate, and the assertions below are written so that nobody
can later mistake it for one and start reconciling it against a live feed. What
is being pinned is that the numbers differ per market, that material and labour
differ from each other, and that the euro projects still read exactly as they
were hand-authored.
