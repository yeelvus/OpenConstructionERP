"""Tests for the country coverage manifest.

These test the instrument, not the coverage. A country having no payment regime
is a finding for the register and not a failure here; the manifest reporting it
as covered, or reporting a broken probe as a gap, is a failure here.

The one property everything else rests on: **UNRESOLVED must never present as
MISSING.** An instrument that turns "I could not measure this" into "there is
nothing there" hands back a finished-looking answer to an unasked question, and
every count downstream of it is wrong in the comfortable direction.

#: It was RU until the Russian pack shipped and put RU in all five, at which
#: point every one of these went red for the right reason: the control had
#: become covered. That is the expected way this constant dies, so when it
#: goes red again, repick it rather than reaching for the probe.

#: It then became PL, and died the same death when the Warsaw pack shipped.
#: Twice is a pattern worth naming: the countries we reach for as controls are

#: than by taste. BD is one of only three of the twenty-five candidate

#: available, without being an unreal market that would make this test a
