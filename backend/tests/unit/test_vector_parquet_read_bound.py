"""The pre-built embedding parquet must be read in bounded batches.

The file carries one embedding per cost item beside its text columns, so for a
large region it is tens of thousands of rows and hundreds of megabytes once
decoded. Reading it whole put all of that in memory before a single record
reached the vector store - the same shape that made a cost-base import kill a
small server, on the same machines, often in the same session.

The bound is checked by watching the batches that come off the reader rather
than by measuring memory. The batch size is what this code decides; resident
memory is decided by the parquet decoder, the allocator and the garbage
collector as well, and a test that measured it would fail for reasons unrelated
to this loop. The batches are observed at the vector store because the loop
hands each one straight over, so their sizes are the reader's sizes.

The third test is the control. It runs the same load with the bound raised out
of reach, which is what reading the file whole looks like from inside the loop,
and asserts the single unbounded batch that would then appear. The fixture
writes the file as one row group precisely so that control means what it says:
the reader never buffers less than a row group, so a file split into several
would come back in several batches whatever the bound.

The last test covers the other half of this endpoint. The vector store is an
optional dependency, and an installation without it used to get an unexplained
500 from here while the sibling indexing endpoint returned a readable message.

No database is involved and nothing is downloaded: the cache directory is
redirected at a temporary file that is already there.
