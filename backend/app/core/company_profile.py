"""Persisted company profile - the letterhead printed on generated documents.

Some firms cannot send an RFI, a transmittal or a certificate without their
formal letterhead on it: the registered name, the address, the licence or
registration numbers, and the logo their lawyers approved. The workspace
already has a logo, but it is the wrong one for that job.
:mod:`app.core.app_branding` is the *app* brand - what the sidebar and the
login page show - and it is served by a PUBLIC endpoint, because the login page
reads it before anyone signs in. A registered address and a tax identifier have
no business on an anonymous endpoint, and the sidebar mark is often a cropped
or simplified version of the formal logo anyway.

So the company profile is a separate record in its own file::

    <data-dir>/company_profile.json

read only by signed-in users and written only by admins. Keeping it in its own
file, rather than as extra keys in the branding file, is what keeps it off the
public branding response: that endpoint serialises whatever the branding module
returns, and a field that is never in that file can never leak through it.

**Why every field is free text.** Letterheads are not a form the platform gets
to design. Address order differs by country (house number before or after the
street, postcode before or after the city, a state line or none), and the
identifiers a firm must print are jurisdiction-specific: a contractor licence
and an EIN in one place, a VAT number and a commercial register entry in
another. Any label this module printed for them would be a translation of
somebody else's legal term. The firm writes the lines exactly as they appear on
its paper and the PDF prints them verbatim.

**Nothing here raises.** Same contract as :mod:`app.core.pdf_appearance`: a
profile that cannot be read, or that a hand edit filled with nonsense, loses the
offending field and nothing else. A document a customer is waiting for must not
be lost to a malformed phone number.

stdlib-only and modelled on :mod:`app.core.pdf_appearance`, reusing the same
data-dir resolution, so it stays cheap to import and needs no migration.
