"""Repricing a region has to reach the assemblies built on it.

Three code paths write ``CostItem.rate``. Two of them announced the change and
the assemblies subscriber pulled the new price through. The third,
``reprice_region`` - the one that rewrites a whole region from the resource
price sheet, and the one a user reaches for when prices move - announced
nothing. So the rates moved, every assembly quoting them kept its own copy of
``unit_cost``, and a budget built from assemblies never saw the reprice. It was
reported from a live self-hosted install, not found by reading.

Two things are asserted here and they fail for different reasons.

The first is the fix: a component priced from a region follows that region's
new rate, and its parent's ``total_rate`` follows the component. Both are stored
snapshots, so both have to be checked - re-reading the component and leaving the
parent stale would still leave the budget wrong.

The second is the guard around it. The refresh reads the rate out of the table,
and a rate that cannot be parsed as a number must leave the row alone. The
obvious way to write this loop uses the module's ``_safe_decimal``, which
answers 0 for anything it cannot read; that is right for a missing factor and
catastrophic for a price, because one unreadable rate would zero every component
built on it and collapse the parent to nothing. A test that only checks the
happy path passes just as well with that bug in place.
