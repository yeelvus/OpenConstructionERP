"""The server must keep accepting after a client resets in the listen backlog.

On Windows uvicorn runs on asyncio's proactor loop unless told otherwise, and
CPython's proactor loop closes the listening socket when one accept fails
(``BaseProactorEventLoop._start_serving``: "Accept failed on a socket", then
``sock.close()``). A client that resets its connection while waiting to be
accepted makes the next ``AcceptEx`` fail with WinError 64, so one impatient
browser was enough to leave the desktop backend alive but refusing every
connection: the app looked frozen until restarted. ``app.core.server_loop``
keeps the proactor loop on Windows but gives it a proactor that re-posts an
accept a vanished client made fail. It deliberately does not switch to the
selector loop, which drops outgoing data on Windows.

The socket tests replay that with real sockets and no mocks: reset a client in
the backlog, start serving, then connect a healthy client. The proactor leg is
the control. It shows the reproduction actually reproduces, so the server leg
passing means something. The loop under test is built the way the server builds
it, through ``uvicorn.Config(loop=uvicorn_loop_option()).get_loop_factory()``,
and each run uses an explicit ``asyncio.Runner`` so the loop policy the test
conftest installs cannot stand in for the fix.
