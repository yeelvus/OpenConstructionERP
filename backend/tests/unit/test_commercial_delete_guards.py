# Two delete paths took the commercial record of a live job away in one call.
#
# ``ContractsService.delete_contract`` had no lifecycle check at all, so a
# signed, running contract could be deleted along with everything cascading off
# it: variations, progress claims, payment certificates, retention. Change
# orders already guard this correctly and are the template.
#
# ``SubcontractorService.delete_subcontractor`` had the same shape. Deleting a
# firm that is on a job took its subcontract agreements with it, and with them
# the payment applications, retention ledger and ratings hanging off those
# agreements: the record of work somebody actually performed and was paid for.
#
# Both are exercised against stub repositories. The defect is a missing decision
# rather than a query, so the test only has to observe whether the delete is
# refused and whether the repository was reached at all.
