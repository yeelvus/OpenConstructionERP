"""The answer has to say which years it was actually informed about.

The seeded calendars cover one year, and a range reaching past it is answered
rather than refused because a schedule running past December is ordinary use.
That makes the disclosure the contract: a caller must be able to separate the
part of the answer built from a declared calendar from the part built from a
fallback.

Reported per year, never per range. A range that straddles the boundary is the
case that matters, and one flag across it would be true and useless: it would
say "something here was a fallback" without saying which half. So the assertions
below are on the shape of the per-year list, and
:func:`test_a_straddling_range_reports_each_year_differently` is the one that
would fail if this were ever collapsed into a single boolean.

Loaded from the shipped seed through the real seeder, for the same reason as the
sibling module: a fixture would prove the mechanism and certify nothing about
the data we ship.
