"""A saved setting must be seen even when the clock did not move.

:mod:`app.core.pdf_appearance` and :mod:`app.core.app_branding` both keep a
process-local cache of their parsed settings file so a PDF export does not
re-read it once per page. Both used to decide whether that cache was still good
by comparing modification times alone, which assumes the filesystem gives two
different contents two different timestamps. Windows does not: two writes in
the same clock tick get a byte-for-byte identical ``st_mtime_ns``, measured at
139 collisions in 200 consecutive pairs on a developer machine. The file
changes, the recorded time does not, and the cache keeps serving the previous
answer until some later save happens to land in a different tick.

For appearance that is worse than a stale render. The PUT endpoint reads the
stored values, merges the admin's fields over them and writes the result back,
so a stale read is persisted: the save that was shadowed is reverted on disk.

These tests force the collision with :func:`os.utime` instead of racing for it,
so the defect reproduces on every platform. Raced, it showed up only on the
Windows lane, which is advisory - the bug would have been guarded by a job that
cannot fail the build.
