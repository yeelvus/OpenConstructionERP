"""A listen socket is not a database, and the readiness probe has to know that.

A released build announced "Embedded PostgreSQL ready" and then failed every
connection it made in the next breath. The cluster it attached to was a
postmaster left alive by an earlier run that had died after starting it: the
process still held its listen socket, so a bare ``connect`` succeeded and the
probe reported a healthy database, while nothing behind that socket could serve
a session.

These tests pin both halves of the answer. The probe has to speak the protocol
rather than open a socket, and the recovery has to end a postmaster that only
listens - detection alone would leave the user exactly as stuck, with a better
worded failure.

The three states are deliberately distinguished, because two of them must never
be acted on: a cluster replaying WAL has not opened its socket yet, and a
cluster too busy to take another client answers with an error, which is an
answer. Only "accepts and says nothing" is the broken one.

The third thing pinned here is who the recovery is allowed to end. Deciding to
stop something is not the same as deciding what to stop, and the check that
answers the second question reads the operating system, which answers it
differently on each of the three platforms. So the ownership tests below assert
the same property on all of them, including with the machine-wide socket table
refusing to answer the way macOS refuses it.
