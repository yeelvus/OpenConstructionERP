# Ireland Construction Pack

Configures OpenConstructionERP for the Irish construction market. Measurement
follows ARM (Agreed Rules of Measurement) and NRM, the two standards Irish QS
practice sits between. Currency is EUR with 13.5% VAT on construction services,
and the pack references BCAR (Building Control Amendment Regulations) and the
RIAI/SCSI contract and practice frameworks.

## What makes an Irish estimate Irish

An Irish bill of quantities is measured to ARM4, the rules agreed between the
SCSI (Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland) and the CIF (Construction Industry
Federation). In practice most Irish QS offices also reference NRM, since Irish
and UK measurement traditions share the same ancestry, and public clients
increasingly ask for NRM-aligned documents. The pack enables the NRM rule set,
which covers both.

Construction VAT in Ireland is 13.5 percent on building services, not the
standard 23 percent that applies to most goods. The distinction matters in
estimating because every line in a bill carries the reduced rate and the
professional fee carries the standard rate. The pack sets the `ie_vat_13_5`
tax template for construction works.

Contracts follow either the RIAI forms (Yellow or Blue book) for private work
or the PWC (Public Works Contract) suite administered by the Government
Contracts Committee. BCAR (SI No. 9 of 2014) and the TGD (Technical Guidance
Document) series define the building control framework.
