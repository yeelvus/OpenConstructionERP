# Singapore Construction Pack

Configures OpenConstructionERP for the Singapore construction market. Measurement
follows SMM7, the standard method that Singapore QS practice is built on. Currency
is SGD with 9% GST on construction services. The BCA regulatory framework, CONQUAS
quality benchmarks and SIA/PSSCOC contract forms are referenced for compliance
context.

## What makes a Singaporean estimate Singaporean

A bill of quantities in Singapore is measured to SMM7, the same standard method the
UK uses, adapted to local practice by the Singapore Institute of Surveyors and
Valuers. The BCA (Building and Construction Authority) regulates the industry and
its buildability and CONQUAS frameworks shape project delivery.

Construction contracts typically follow SIA (Singapore Institute of Architects)
conditions for private work or PSSCOC (Public Sector Standard Conditions of
Contract) for government projects. Both are well defined and widely understood.

GST at 9 percent applies to construction services. The pack sets the `sg_gst_9`
tax template.

## What this pack enables
