/**
 * Playwright E2E test configuration for OpenConstructionERP frontend.
 *
 * Scope: this config drives the NEW QA infrastructure under `tests/e2e/`
 * (smoke/, fixtures/, helpers/). The legacy spec folder `./e2e/` is still
 * served by its dedicated configs (e.g. `playwright.boq-tour.config.ts`,
 * `playwright.match.config.ts`) and is intentionally excluded here so the
 * harness can be opted-into per-batch without sweeping in older flows.
 *
 * Run examples:
 *   npm run test:e2e:smoke           # all smoke specs, all browsers
 *   npm run test:e2e:headed          # headed (debug)
 *   npx playwright test smoke/health.spec.ts --project=chromium
 *   ./tests/e2e/runner/parallel-runner.sh batch-01-auth
 *
 * Environment variables:
 *   OE_TEST_BASE_URL    — defaults to http://localhost:5173
 *   OE_TEST_API_URL     — backend, defaults to http://localhost:8000
 *   OE_TEST_LOCALE      — en|de|ru|ar|es|fr|pt|it|pl|ja|ko|zh (default en)
 *   OE_TEST_DEMO_EMAIL  — demo account, defaults to demo@openconstructionerp.com
 *   OE_TEST_DEMO_PASSWORD
 *   OE_TEST_WORKERS     — override worker count (cap is 4)
 *   CI                  — when set, retries=2 and forbidOnly=true

// measures nothing there. One constant so the two halves cannot drift.
// @responsive was in this alternation and carried by no spec anywhere, so the
// mobile project promised a tag it never selected - the same shape as the RTL
// project selecting a test that measured no direction. Dropping it is a no-op
// against the tree (nothing matched it) and stops the promise being made.

  // under a directory called `runner`. GitHub's Linux and macOS runners check
  // out into /home/runner/work/... and /Users/runner/work/..., so that one
  // pattern ignored EVERY spec in the repository and all five projects
  // selected zero tests. Windows runners use D:\a\..., which is why this was
  // green on Windows and red on the other two, and why it could not be
  // reproduced by reading the config. The directory this line is really about
  // is tests/e2e/runner/, so it now says so.
