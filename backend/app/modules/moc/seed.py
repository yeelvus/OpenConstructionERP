"""Demo seed data for the Management of Change (MoC) module.

``seed_moc(session, project_ids)`` creates a small, deterministic set of
MoC entries spread across the lifecycle states (proposed, reviewed,
accepted, declined, implemented) and attaches one to three impact rows
(cost, schedule, quality, safety) to each entry.

The seed is idempotent: it short-circuits when a MoC entry with the
expected marker code already exists for the first project id, so it is
safe to call more than once.
