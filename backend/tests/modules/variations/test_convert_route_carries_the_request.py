"""Promoting a request over HTTP must commit the figures it was approved on.

The service carries a request's own figures into the order for anything the
caller left unnamed, but the route used to name every field itself, so the
carry-forward never fired on the only path a user can reach. The variations
page sends a currency and nothing else, which meant every order promoted
through the interface was created valued at zero, and the change order
mirroring it was priced off the same nothing.

These tests drive the route handler rather than the service, because that is
where the defect lived and where nothing was asserting anything: no test in
the tree touched ``convert-to-vo`` at all. The handler is called directly with
its dependencies supplied, so what is exercised is the body it accepts and the
payload it builds. The permission dependency in front of it does not run this
way and is not covered here.

The invariant worth keeping is that the amount the high-value gate is applied
to and the amount the order ends up carrying are the same amount. It is
asserted from both sides below: a caller who may not approve that figure is
refused, and a caller who may sees exactly that figure committed.

PostgreSQL, py3.12 - needs the app plus a database.
