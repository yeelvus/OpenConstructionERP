// Case: "Settle a period in process and get it signed" (CN).
//
// In-process settlement divides the works into periods or nodes and settles
// each one while the people who did the work are still on site. The completed
// and undisputed quantities for the period, including the changes accepted in
// it, are priced and confirmed by both parties, and the confirmed document is
// meant to be carried into the final account rather than argued again.
//
// The commercial value of that is entirely in the paper. A period settled by
// handshake is a period that gets reopened, so the case is built around
// producing a document with a fixed content, a named version of the bill behind
// it, and two signatures on the record - and around keeping those documents
// together so the final account is assembled from them. Content strings are key
// plus inline English default and live only here.

    "Settling as you go is the practice that stops a final account becoming an archaeology project. The reasoning is simple: the people who can say what happened in March are available in April and gone in eighteen months, and a quantity confirmed while the work is visible costs an hour to agree and a fortnight to reconstruct. What makes it hold afterwards is not the agreement, it is the document - a statement of exactly which quantities and which accepted changes were confirmed, tied to a named version of the bill so both parties can point at the same numbers, with two signatures against it. A bill legitimately keeps moving after a period is settled, because that is what later periods are for. What must not happen is a settled statement whose content changes underneath the signatures it already carries, and the fix for that is a version you can name rather than a bill you promise not to touch.",
