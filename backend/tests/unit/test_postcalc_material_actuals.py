"""DB-free unit tests for the material half of the post-calculation report.

Post-calculation used to report material cost as unknown on every project, even
where the site had metered its yard: ``actual_cost_known`` was set for labour
and plant and for nothing else. The report could tell a foreman the crew beat
the labour norm and could not say whether the material went over, which is the
half that usually loses the money.

These tests pin down the three things that make the answer trustworthy. The
figure has to come from the site material ledger and agree with what that module
reports for the same movements. It has to stay unknown - not zero - wherever the
site recorded nothing, priced nothing, or priced it in another currency. And the
comparison has to be against the money the estimate allowed for the quantity
actually installed, because a line that is half built has spent about half its
material budget and that is not a saving.

Everything here is plain values: the pure compute layer and the site-inventory
value objects, no database, no ORM, no FastAPI.
