"""Regression test for POST /api/v1/client-errors/ returning a 500.

This is the sink the frontend reports its own runtime errors to
(``frontend/src/shared/lib/errorLogger.ts``). It is unauthenticated,
fire-and-forget (``void fetch(...)``, no ``keepalive``), and commonly
fired right as the page navigates away - which is exactly when a browser
aborts the in-flight request client-side before the full body arrives.
Starlette surfaces that as an unhandled ``starlette.requests.ClientDisconnect``
raised out of ``await request.body()`` (``app/modules/client_errors/router.py``),
which nothing catches, so the app's global exception handler turns it into
a real ``500`` - every client-side error captured right at navigation is
silently discarded, and the server log under-reports how unhealthy the UI
actually is.

The happy-path tests go through the full app (not the router in isolation)
to exercise the real middleware chain. The disconnect regression drives the
ASGI app directly with a hand-built ``receive()`` that delivers a partial
body followed by ``http.disconnect`` - the one thing an HTTP test client
(``httpx.AsyncClient`` over ``ASGITransport``) cannot simulate, since it
always delivers a complete body.
