"""Backfilling a healed column is half the repair; the column itself must move.

``oe_funding_obligation.detail_params`` arrives in two different shapes. An
installation that takes the migration gets it from ``add_column`` with
``nullable=False`` and a default. An installation whose tables came from
``Base.metadata.create_all`` plus the boot heal gets it from the heal, which
renders a column default into DDL only when the default has a literal
spelling. ``default=dict`` is a callable and has none, so there the column
lands nullable with no default.

The migration used to answer only half of that. It backfilled the NULL rows,
which is what the reading code needs, and left the column declaration alone,
which is what ``/api/health`` reads. So a healed installation went on
reporting ``schema_matches_models=false`` for its whole life over a column
whose rows were by then all populated. That is a standing false alarm, and the
cost of one is that it teaches an operator to read a degraded status as
normal, which is exactly how a real drift later goes unnoticed.

These tests run ``upgrade()`` against a recording double, because the point
being pinned is which statements are emitted on which path, and that is
decided before any database sees them. Three scenarios, and the value is in
the pair rather than in any one of them: the healed path proves the tightening
is not trapped inside the ``if`` that path skips, and the migration path
proves it was not written for the healed path alone. A change that satisfies
either one by itself fails the other.
