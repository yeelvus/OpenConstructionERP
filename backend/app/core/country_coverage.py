"""Ask one question of every country-shaped registry in the product.

The product has several registries that vary by country, each invented where it
was needed and each with its own shape: a tuple of dicts with a ``country_code``
field, a dict keyed by region code with a ``DEFAULT`` entry, a dict of functions,
a seeded JSON file. Nothing could answer "is Canada covered", and the answer
turned out to be "it has a working calendar and no payment regime" - which
nobody had noticed, because there was nowhere to look.

**This module centralises the question and not the data.** Every registry stays
where it is and keeps its own shape; a probe here knows how to ask it. Adding a
country is still an edit in the owning module. That is the plugin principle and
this file does not trade it.

Reading a report
----------------

The six verdicts are deliberately not collapsible into "yes / no", because the
useful distinctions are between the shades of no:

``COVERED``      the registry has a row of this country's own.
``FALLBACK``     something resolves for this country, but by default or alias
                 rather than on its own terms. A caller sees an answer and
                 cannot tell it was not written for them.
``MISSING``      the registry is country-keyed, is populated, and this country
                 is not in it.
``NOT_KEYED``    the registry exists and has no country axis at all, so the
                 question cannot be put to it. Wanting a per-country answer here
                 means changing its shape, not adding a row.
``ABSENT``       no such registry exists anywhere in the product.
``UNRESOLVED``   the probe could not answer. An import failed, a symbol moved,
                 or a shape changed.

``UNRESOLVED`` is counted separately from ``MISSING`` everywhere, and that
separation is the point of the file. An instrument that reports what it could
not measure as an absence tells you a comfortable lie: it converts "I do not
know" into "there is nothing there", and the second reads as a finished
question. Unmeasured and fine are different words.

An empty population is treated as ``UNRESOLVED`` rather than as "every country
is missing", for the same reason. A probe that finds nothing at all has almost
certainly broken, and a registry that genuinely emptied is worth the same alarm.

Writing a probe
---------------

**A probe has to be able to answer without a database.** That is not a taste in
dependencies, it is a constraint the repository enforces from somewhere you
will not find by reading this file. ``.github/workflows/repo-hygiene.yml:550``,
the step named "Check the instrument runs and no country has fallen to zero"
(grep the step name, the line number will drift), runs
``backend/scripts/country_coverage.py --strict --ignore-unprobed`` in a lane
with no PostgreSQL service that sets no ``DATABASE_URL``. Read what that
flag does and does not do: it suppresses exit 3, the code for a census with
registries nobody probes, and it does **not** suppress exit 1, the code for a
probe that could not resolve its registry. So an import-only probe does not
merely lose a row on a developer's laptop. It takes a green lane red on the
commit that adds it, for a reason that says nothing about the product.

This is easy to walk into, and was walked into: ``demo.catalogue_projects``
below was written import-only and would have done exactly this. Worse, the
failure mode selects for the interesting registries - the ones worth probing
are disproportionately the ones whose module reaches an ORM import and builds
an engine before any literal in it is reachable.

So a probe reads its registry through one of the two-path helpers, which import
where an import is available and parse the file where it is not, and label the
reading either way so a source read is never printed as though the live object
had answered: :func:`_registry_literal` for a plain literal,
:func:`_annotated_attributes` for class attributes, :func:`_isolated_namespace`
for a registry that has to be executed to exist. Where a registry is assembled
at runtime and no literal holds the answer, rebuild the assembly from the same
files the product reads and pin the rebuild against the import with a test -
:func:`_demo_catalogue_countries` is the worked example.

Before shipping a probe, run that lane's argv with no database and read the
printed output rather than the exit code. "instrument healthy: every probe
resolved its registry" is the line that says you have not broken it.

# Resolving a registry that lives in a module you cannot import
#
# Several of these registries are plain literals sitting in a service module,
# and importing that module pulls in the database configuration. On a developer
# machine with no cluster running, three probes came back UNRESOLVED for that
# reason alone - which is honest but useless, because the registries themselves
# are static and perfectly readable.
#
# So: import first, because that reads the object the product actually runs on,
# and read the file directly when the import will not come - by parse for a
# structural question, or by executing the registry's own definitions alone for
# a behavioural one. The report says which one answered, because an import and
# a read of the file on disk are not equally good evidence.
#
# WHERE A SOURCE READ IS ALLOWED, AND WHERE IT IS NOT. Parsing a table answers
# structural questions - does this table have a country axis at all, how many
# rungs does this ladder have - because those are properties of what is
# written. It must never stand in for a behavioural question by reading a table
# the behaviour does not read directly, because behaviour can sit in aliasing
# layers the table knows nothing about. calendar.schedule_regions is the worked
# example: sixteen of the eighteen countries on its axis are not keys of the
# table at all, so a membership test on the table calls sixteen countries
# uncovered while the resolver returns a real calendar for every one of them.
#
# Executing the resolver itself is a different act and is allowed. When the
# owning module will not import, that probe runs get_work_calendar and the maps
# it reads, alone, out of the same file - the product's own behaviour, run
# rather than guessed at from a neighbouring table. It is still labelled
# "source", because what ran is the file on disk and not the object the live
# process is holding.
#
# WHY A PROBE IS STILL ALLOWED TO REFUSE. If the import succeeds and the symbol
# is gone, the AttributeError propagates and the dimension comes back
# UNRESOLVED. Read that as the instrument working, not as a bug in it. A
# renamed registry is a real finding about the tree, and the second path exists
# to survive a missing database rather than to route around a missing name:
# reaching for it there would turn "this registry moved" into a confident
# answer assembled out of whatever the old name still matched. A probe that
# refuses is a probe reporting that it could not measure, which is the one
# thing this whole file is for.

    ``GB``), regional blocs (``DACH``, ``GULF``) and English country names
    (``CANADA``, ``FRANCE``) - and ``get_work_calendar`` puts three aliasing
    layers in front of it: a whole-label map, and two head maps that cannot
    overlap, one holding ISO country codes and one holding superseded catalogue
    codes that are not and cannot be ISO codes. So membership of the table is
    not the question a caller asks.

    Measured, and stated as a property of the registry rather than of whichever
    countries someone happened to ask about: of the eighteen countries on
    ``_CALENDAR_BY_COUNTRY``, sixteen are not keys of ``WORK_CALENDARS`` at all.
    A membership test on the table calls those sixteen uncovered while the
    resolver returns a real calendar for every one of them. Only ``US`` and
    ``RU`` are spelled the same way in both. Counted over a cohort instead, the
    same fact comes out as five, or ten, or sixteen depending on who was asked,
    which is how a number like this goes stale with nobody having edited it.

    Hence: no reading of the table as a proxy, ever. What the probe does when
    the module will not import is execute the resolver, and the maps it reads,
    alone out of that same file, and put the question to those - the product's
    own behaviour, run rather than guessed at from a neighbouring table, so the
    answer is the one the imported module gives. The report says "source"
    because what ran is the file on disk and not the live module.

    A renamed registry still ends as UNRESOLVED from either direction: the
    attribute lookup in :func:`_schedule_registry` sits outside its handler so
    its AttributeError propagates, and the isolated read raises ``LookupError``
    for a name it cannot find bound exactly once. That is a real finding about
    the tree, and the second path exists to survive a missing database rather
    than to route around a missing name.
