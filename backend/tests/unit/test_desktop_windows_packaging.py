"""What the Windows desktop build is allowed to ship, and how it installs.

Two decisions live here, both of which are one line of configuration and both of
which fail silently when reverted. A silent packaging regression is not a
hypothetical in this project: v15.0.0 shipped a desktop bundle with no
translation catalogue, the gate that should have caught it was green, and the
application did not start for a single user.

The tests read the real files rather than a copy, and they print what they
counted. A gate that prints only its verdict cannot be distinguished from a gate
that examined nothing.
