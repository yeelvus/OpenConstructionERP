"""Fail if the Alembic revision graph that ships has more than one head.

Written the day three agents added a revision each in parallel and two of them
chained off the same parent. Every one of them checked ``alembic heads`` inside
its own task and every one of them truthfully reported a single head, because
each ran before the others had written their file. The fork was only visible to
someone looking at all three at once, which is exactly the kind of thing a gate
should be doing instead of a person.

A second head is not a cosmetic problem. ``alembic upgrade head`` refuses to
run against an ambiguous head, so the fork is discovered by whoever upgrades
first, which on a release is the user.

Why this asks about the commit and not only about the disk
----------------------------------------------------------
On 2026-08-28 ``v3311_rebar_schedule`` was committed declaring
``down_revision = "v3310_variation_request_boq"``. ``v3310`` is a complete,
well-written revision that had been sitting untracked in a shared working tree
since the evening before. The author ran this script first and it said 342
revisions, exactly one head. That was a true statement, and it was about a tree
that existed on one disk and nowhere else. In the commit the same graph held a
revision whose parent did not exist, therefore two heads, and ``alembic upgrade
head`` on a fresh clone refused to run at all. Every install built from that
commit could not migrate. It was caught by CI, where the working directory is
the commit, and by then it was pushed.

So the disk answer is not the answer. This script computes both graphs, prints
one line when they agree, and when they differ says so in those words and names
the revisions on each side. The committed graph decides the exit code, because
that is the graph that ships.

Where the committed content comes from
--------------------------------------
From the index, read with ``git ls-files --stage`` and ``git cat-file --batch``.
The index already is HEAD's blobs with the staged changes applied: a tracked
file nobody touched carries HEAD's sha, a staged add or edit replaces it, a
staged delete drops out, and an untracked file was never in it. So the tree
that would be committed needs no reconstruction, no temp directory and nothing
written anywhere. Neither does it need any history, which matters because CI
checks out shallow and the index is fully populated there regardless.

The one thing the index does not model is this repository's own commit form.
Work here goes in as ``git commit --only -F msg -- <paths>``, which builds its
tree from HEAD plus the working-tree content of the named paths and ignores the
index entirely, so nothing is ever staged. Run with no arguments in that
workflow the check would answer about HEAD and stay silent about the file about
to be committed, which is the original failure wearing a new hat. Hence
``--committing``: name the paths you are about to commit and their working-tree
content is laid over the index base. That invocation is the one that reproduces
the incident and goes red.

Why this reads the files instead of asking Alembic
--------------------------------------------------
``ScriptDirectory`` would answer the same question and would answer it more
authoritatively. It also imports the Alembic and SQLAlchemy stack, which on at
least one developer machine here wedges for minutes on an unrelated Windows
management call during ``import sqlalchemy``. A gate that hangs is a gate people
disable. This one reads text and needs no database, no driver and no config.

The cost of that choice is that the parser has to be right, and the first draft
was not: it read ``down_revision`` with a single-line regex, so every merge
revision whose parents are a tuple spread over several lines lost its parents
and was counted as a base. It reported 43 heads and 18 bases. The heads number
looked alarming but plausible; the bases number is what gave it away, because an
Alembic graph has exactly one base. That is why this script prints bases and
edge counts rather than only the answer it was asked for: the number that
refutes a broken scan is usually not the number you were looking at.

The two readers share that parser exactly. ``read_graph`` takes name and text
pairs and has no idea where they came from, because a divergence report built
on two parsers would invent differences that are really disagreements between
the instruments.

Exit codes: 0 the committed graph is sound, 1 it is broken, 2 it could not be
measured. A check that cannot measure never reports a pass.
