"""The global admin role does not cross a tenant boundary in property_dev.

The module decided once that ownership is strict: an admin from another
tenant must still 404 on an object they do not own. That decision lived in
one helper's docstring while sibling helpers kept an admin bypass, so the
module answered two ways depending on which door a request came through.

DISCOVERY IS BY WIRING, NOT BY NAME. The population is the module's own
route table: every mutating route it registers, and the functions each one
actually reaches. Naming the gates instead would repeat the defect this
suite exists to catch. An earlier draft of this test discovered helpers by
the ``_verify_owner_via_*`` prefix and would have gone green while missing
the live broker gate entirely, because that gate is called
``_ensure_broker_owner`` and the prefixed broker helper it looks like is
reached by no route at all. A scope written as a name is blind to the
sibling that does the work, and it counts dead code as covered.

Reaching from the route table fixes both. A renamed gate stays in the
population because the route still reaches it, a gate written under a
fourth naming shape is included the day it is wired up, and an unreachable
helper is excluded because no route reaches it.

Where spelling still enters, and why it is the safe direction. Discovery
narrows by nothing but wiring: every registered route, every verb, and the
whole transitive call graph underneath. The two DETECTORS do read spelling,
matching the literal ``admin`` and the fields ``owner_id`` and ``tenant_id``,
and a gate comparing some third field under a name nobody here guessed would
not be recognised. Both are deliberately broad and both fail toward
flagging, so the cost of that residue is a false alarm rather than a silent
pass. The exemption lists are keyed to ROUTE handlers, and a renamed handler
breaks the stale-entry test loudly instead of quietly granting an amnesty.

    verbs would leave every single-object GET outside the population.

    Read off the assembled APIRouter, so this is the real route table rather
    than a guess from decorators or names.

    Included routers are walked rather than assumed flat. ``router`` mounts
    the buyer portal through ``include_router``, and this FastAPI version
    leaves an ``_IncludedRouter`` wrapper in ``routes`` holding the child
    under ``original_router`` instead of splicing the child's routes in.
    Reading only the top level silently dropped all nine portal routes,
    which is exactly the kind of quiet under-count this suite exists to
    prevent.

    The descent is by SHAPE, not by attribute name: anything reachable from
    a route object that carries its own ``routes`` is followed. A rename of
    that private attribute therefore does not silently shrink the
    population, which is the same mistake at one remove.

    How we know the walk is complete rather than merely plausible: the
    assembled table yields 142 mutating routes, and an independent scan of
    the ``@router.<verb>`` decorators in the module source yields the same
    142. Two mechanisms that share no code agreeing on a count is the only
