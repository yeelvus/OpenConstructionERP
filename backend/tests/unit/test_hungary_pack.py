"""The Hungarian pack, and the three places its facts are written down twice.

A country pack states the same thing in several files by necessity: the engine
holds the chapter list because rules run on it, the manifest holds it because
the onboarding wizard renders it, and the reference document holds it because
a person reads it. Copies drift, and the drift is silent, so each pair is
compared here rather than trusted.

The one that matters most is the chapter list. A rule that accepts a chapter
the pack does not offer, or a pack that offers one the rule rejects, produces
a warning on a correctly written bill, which is the fastest way to teach a user
to ignore a rule set.

No database and no application settings: the manifest is imported directly and
everything else is filesystem and JSON.
