"""What a tax row is not allowed to say, and where saying it is stopped.

The defect these rules exist for is a quiet one, which is what makes it worth
guarding rather than documenting. ``combination`` defaults to ``national`` and
so does the column, so a Canadian provincial rate created through the API
without setting it inherits a value that means "this country has no
federal/provincial split". Such a row is not merely wrong, it is *invisible*:
it matches no per-province lookup, the province falls through to the federal
5 %, and no error, no log line and no health signal reports that a rate was
missed. Nothing was missing. It was mislabelled.

Three layers stand between that row and the table, and each is tested here
because each catches something the others do not:

1. :func:`~app.modules.i18n_foundation.tax_rules.validate_tax_row`, the rules
   themselves, pure and callable from anywhere.
2. The service, which is the only path the router has and which supplies the
   one input the pure function cannot work out for itself - whether the
   country already carries a federal layer.
3. The table's own check constraint, which is the only one of the three that
   is a property of the data rather than of the code that wrote it, and so the
   only one a future writer cannot forget to call.

The seed loader is the fourth writer and it calls layer 1 directly; that is
covered in ``test_i18n_foundation_tax_combination.py``, against the file it
actually ships.
