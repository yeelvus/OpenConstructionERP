"""A project's cost position: committed, invoiced and paid, read from the records.

The finance dashboard used to take committed and actual from two columns on
``ProjectBudget`` that event handlers keep up to date. That cache could not
carry the figures a contractor needs:

* an order approved before any budget row existed was never committed at all
  (the handler found no row to add it to and moved on);
* it committed an order at its gross, VAT included, against a net budget;
* subcontract agreements and payment applications have no writer into it, so
  the largest commitments on a typical job never reached finance.

So the dashboard reads them here instead, from the rows that are the record:
purchase orders, supplier invoices and their payments, subcontract agreements
and their payment applications. Every figure is computed per currency and the
caller converts to the project currency, the same as every other dashboard sum.

Basis of each figure
--------------------
Committed and actual are two halves of one outturn: ``actual`` is what has
been incurred, ``committed`` is what is promised and not yet incurred, and
``committed + actual`` is what the project will finish at. Each is computed
per source (an order, a subcontract, a supplier invoice with neither behind
it), and ``sources`` carries them one by one so the budget rows can be kept
to exactly the same figures (``FinanceService.sync_project_budget``).

``actual`` (net of VAT)
    An order: the larger of what its confirmed goods receipts are worth and
    what has been settled on its invoices. A subcontract: what has been
    settled on the invoices billing it. Any other supplier invoice: what has
    been settled on it. "Settled" is the invoice's net once it is paid, and
    before that the payments on it (retention withheld included, since that
    money is owed and only paid later) with the VAT share taken out.
``committed`` (net of VAT, the open part)
    Each source's full commitment less its actual, never below zero. The full
    commitment of an order is the larger of its net value and the invoices
    raised against it, never their sum. That of a live subcontract (an
    agreement, or a contract with a subcontractor that no signed agreement
    carries) is the larger of its value and what has been approved against
    it; a terminated one keeps only what was approved. An order and a
    subcontract raised from the same tender award are one commitment, counted
    at the order while it commits. A supplier invoice with
    no order or subcontract behind it is committed at its own net on the day
    it is invoiced: money spent without an order.
``over_commitment`` (net of VAT)
    What a source has incurred beyond its full commitment: received beyond an
    order that nobody invoiced, or settled beyond a subcontract's value. Its
    committed stays at zero rather than going negative, and the excess is
    reported here instead of vanishing into that zero.
``invoiced`` (net of VAT)
    Supplier invoices from ``pending`` on, at their subtotal, and payment
    applications finance has approved, at the approved gross. Retention is
    part of the gross: it is owed, only later.
``paid`` (cash, VAT included)
    Payments on supplier invoices, refunds netted out, and the cash paid on
    payment applications (the approved net, retention withheld). An invoice
    marked paid with no payment recorded counts at its full total.
``paid_net`` (net of VAT)
    The same payments with the VAT share taken out, pro rata to the invoice's
    subtotal over its total, so it compares with a net budget.

Receivable (client) invoices are outside all of them; this is the cost side.
