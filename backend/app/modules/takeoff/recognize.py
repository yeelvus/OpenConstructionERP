"""Offline, deterministic candidate detection for PDF takeoff (issue #194).

The online counterpart is the LLM text analyzer (``POST /documents/{id}/analyze/``).
This module is its offline, geometry-driven complement: it reads the vector
drawing layer of a PDF page (PyMuPDF ``page.get_drawings()``) and proposes
candidate measurements:

* rectangles and clean closed loops -> ``area`` candidates,
* long straight strokes -> ``distance`` (length) candidates,
* repeated small closed shapes -> ``count`` candidates.

Nothing is persisted here. Every candidate carries an honest ``confidence``
and a human-readable ``reason`` so the user confirms, edits or rejects it on
the canvas (CLAUDE.md rule 7: AI-augmented, human-confirmed).

The module is pure and DB-free so it unit-tests without a database or a real
PDF. PyMuPDF is a base dependency and is imported lazily by the *caller*; this
module only consumes the already extracted primitives, accessing point-like /
rect-like objects defensively so tests can feed plain tuples.
