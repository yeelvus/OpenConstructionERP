"""A group that had no value is not a group whose value says so.

``_group_key`` turns one grouped column's value into the key it takes in a
KPI's breakdown, and it answered ``"(unset)"`` for a NULL. That is a data
value, spelled the way a person would spell one, and both grouped paths
assign into a dict keyed by it:

* ``_evaluate_top_by``  - ``breakdown[_group_key(grp)] = {...}``
* ``evaluate_spec``     - ``result.breakdown[key] = str(_fold(...))``

So a table holding rows with no value in the grouped column *and* rows
whose value is literally the text ``(unset)`` produced one breakdown entry
where there were two groups, and the later write won. A group vanished
from the KPI and the aggregate stopped decomposing into its parts. This
was found while cleaning Python out of the report writers, where the same
string was read as a hardcoded English label; the label is the smaller
half of it.

The replacement is a reserved key rather than a translated word. A word
cannot be localised once it is a dict key - by then it is indistinguishable
from a real group value like ``m3`` - whereas a name a consumer can test
for is mapped to whatever label that consumer speaks. It is reserved and
not impossible: a row whose group value is literally ``__null__`` collides
in exactly the way ``(unset)`` did. That is the trade, taken knowingly,
against an empty string (which collides with a genuine empty-string group,
and merges two groups that a NULL check in SQL keeps apart) and against a
word (which collides with prose somebody typed).

    cd backend
    python -m pytest tests/unit/test_bi_dashboards_a_null_group_is_not_a_data_value.py -v
