"""Data-access layer for collaboration locks.

All queries are scoped to a single SQLAlchemy session passed in by the
service; no global state.  The only primitive this layer exposes that is
not a plain CRUD call is :meth:`acquire`, which performs a
best-effort "insert if no live lock exists" using a small retry loop so
two concurrent requests cannot both believe they got the lock.
