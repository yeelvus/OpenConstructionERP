"""PG: a price edit re-prices its own line, and a resource edit only what it names.

Two defects on the single-position PATCH path, both reported as "the BOQ freezes
when I put in a price".

The money one. A ``unit_rate`` edit on a position with resources rescales that
position's resource rates (OC-21). The resource propagation of issue #133 then
read the rescaled rates as a person editing the master resource definition, and
when the edited position was the oldest carrier of a resource code it rewrote
that resource on every other position of the project sharing the code. On the
demo bill that was 299 other lines re-priced, 300 UPDATEs and 300 events for one
typed number, and at 2,080 lines the request did not finish. Paste, fill-down,
the bulk rate factor, the audit fix and restore-field all send a bare
``unit_rate``, so none of it needed the locked rate cell.

The load one. Every PATCH loaded the whole bill, positions and markups, three
times over (ownership guard, lock guard, activity log) plus once more for the
duplicate check.

Gated by ``OE_TEST_DB=pg`` (see conftest).
