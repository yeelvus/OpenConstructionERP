"""Closeout demo seed - a populated handover checklist per demo project.

Closeout shipped routed, permissioned and empty, so the page opened on a
"create a package" prompt on every demo project. This gives each of them the
package a project actually assembles on its way to handover: the checklist for
its project type, extended with the deliverables a real dossier carries, with
the evidence that has already landed attached to the slots it belongs to.

What a reader sees on the screen afterwards is a handover part way through.
Some rows carry a document from the project's own CDE and a green sign-off,
some carry a document that has been attached but not yet checked by anyone,
some are proposals the matcher put forward and nobody has confirmed, and some
are still outstanding. The completeness bar reads a real fraction rather than
0% or a suspicious 100%.

The arithmetic is derived, never asserted. After the bindings are written the
seeder calls :meth:`CloseoutService.recompute_completeness`, the same method the
API calls on every bind and verify, so ``delivered_slot_count`` and
``completeness_pct`` are whatever the module's own rule says they are. A slot
counts as delivered only when a human verified its evidence; a generated
artifact (COBie export, punch-closure report, inspection certificate) is
produced by the package build and no build has run, so those slots read as
outstanding - which is the honest state and is why no seeded package reaches
``ready``.

Evidence is only ever bound to a document that really exists in the project.
A binding to a missing document renders as a bare fallback label, and a binding
to an unrelated file is the kind of thing a careful reader spots immediately, so
a slot with no plausible document in the project is left outstanding instead.

Dates are anchored to the run date, never hardcoded.

Idempotent per project: the table allows one package per project and a project
that already has one is left untouched, so a re-run never doubles anything.
