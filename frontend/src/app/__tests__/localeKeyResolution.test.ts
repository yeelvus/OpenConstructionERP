/**
 * Does a locale key actually resolve, or does it only look present?
 *
 * Every other locale check we own reads the file as text and asks whether a
 * line for the key exists. That question has a right answer and a wrong one
 * that look identical. A locale file is one object holding one member,
 * `translation`, and `i18n.ts` hands i18next that member alone:
 *
 *     const resource = (mod.default ?? mod) as { translation: ... };
 *     i18n.addResourceBundle(code, 'translation', resource.translation, false, true);
 *
 * A key written one level higher, as a sibling of `translation`, is in the
 * file and not in the bundle. Three shipped modules went out exactly that way:
 * 6969 translated keys across 30 languages, every gate green, and every screen
 * in English, because a failed lookup falls back to the `defaultValue` each
 * call site passes rather than showing a raw key.
 *
 * `check_i18n_key_nesting.py` now gates the shape. This asserts the behaviour,
 * which is the part that was never in doubt visually and never true.
 *
 * The locale is read from source and evaluated rather than imported. These
 * files are three megabytes of object literal and handing one to the vitest
 * transform pipeline times the worker out before a single assertion runs.
 * Evaluating the literal is also closer to what is being tested: it asks what
 * the file says, not what a bundler made of it.
