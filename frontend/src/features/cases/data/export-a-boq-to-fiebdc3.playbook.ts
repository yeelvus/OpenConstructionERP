// Case: "Send a bill to Spain in FIEBDC-3".

// Export a priced bill to FIEBDC-3 (BC3), the budget exchange format used
// across Spain and Latin America, check the charset the header declares, then
// prove the round trip through our own reader. Content strings are key plus

The export carries the full chapter and item hierarchy with codes, units, quantities, unit rates and long texts, which is the whole budget rather than a flat price list. Overhead, profit and VAT stay for the receiving tool to apply from its own coefficients, which is also how the importer treats them.",
