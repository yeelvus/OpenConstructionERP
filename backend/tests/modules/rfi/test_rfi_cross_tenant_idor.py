"""Wave 8 (Tests) - RFI cross-tenant IDOR 404 through the REAL access guard.

Every prior RFI endpoint test either overrides ``verify_project_access`` with
a stub (``test_rfi_attachments`` / ``test_rfi_variation_idempotency`` /
``test_rfi_overdue_and_distribution``) - which is in fact a no-op, since the
router calls ``verify_project_access`` as a DIRECT function, not via
``Depends`` - or only asserts the guard is *called*
(``test_rfi_state_fsm.TestCloseEndpointIDOR`` stubs it). None of them prove
that the genuine ``app.dependencies.verify_project_access`` actually answers a
real non-owner / non-admin / non-member caller with a 404 across the RFI
lifecycle. That is the single IDOR case the module most needs pinned, because a
regression there silently turns every RFI endpoint into a cross-tenant oracle.

These tests invoke the route handler coroutines DIRECTLY (no ``TestClient``),
passing a real ``RFIService`` bound to a real PostgreSQL session and the REAL
``verify_project_access``. Calling the handler directly:

* runs on the test's own event loop (so it is locally runnable, unlike the
  ``TestClient``-threaded suites that hit the asyncpg cross-loop issue on
  Windows), and
* bypasses the decorator ``dependencies=[RequirePermission(...)]`` (a route
  decoration, not a handler parameter) so we isolate the IDOR access guard
  rather than the coarse RBAC gate.

The caller is neither the project owner, nor an admin, nor a team member, so
the real guard must raise ``HTTPException(404)`` (never 403, never a 200) -
the IDOR-safe "resource missing == access denied" policy. A control class
proves the very same handlers succeed for the legitimate owner, so the 404s
are the guard firing and not a broken fixture.

DB-backed; runs in CI against the shared ``oe_test_unit`` PostgreSQL database
inside a transaction rolled back on teardown (``tests._pg``).
