"""Seeded bids have to carry the lines the price comparison compares.

The leveling matrix and the budget comparison are both built by indexing a
bid's ``line_items`` on ``position_id``. The demo seeder used to write
``line_items=[]``, so both screens rendered a full grid of empty cells no
matter how many bidders had submitted: the page whose entire purpose is
per-line spread had no per-line data in it.

What is pinned here is not "there are lines" but the three properties that
decide whether the screen reads as real:

* the submitted total is an input, not an output - several packs state their
  bid figures in the package description and derive the bid factor from them,
  so the lines have to add up to the number already written down;
* rate times quantity equals the line total exactly, because the matrix reads
  any disagreement between the two as a *scaled* bid line and badges it, and a
  demo where every cell is badged says the opposite of what it means to;
* two bidders pricing the same line differ by more than rounding, or the
  matrix has nothing to colour.

Pure arithmetic over stub positions, so it needs no database.
