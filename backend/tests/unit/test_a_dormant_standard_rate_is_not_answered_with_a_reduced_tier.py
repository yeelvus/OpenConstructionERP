"""A country's reduced tier must not answer a question about its standard rate.

What was wrong
--------------
``resolve`` picks the country-wide row flagged ``is_default``. When no row in
force carries that flag it falls back to promoting a lone unflagged row, which
is right for a table written before the flag existed and wrong for a table
whose standard rate is on file with a window that has not started yet.

Six of the countries in the shipped seed are the second case, and between them
they misquote every date before their standard rate begins: Germany answers
7 % for 1990, Finland 14 % for 2015, Britain 0 % for 1990, Ireland 13.5 % for
2005, Italy 10 % for 2000 and Russia 10 % for 2010. Each came back with
``resolved`` true and a number a caller would put on an invoice.

Why nothing saw it
------------------
Every one of those is a real published tier of the country that answered it,
on file with a real start date, returned through the branch that exists to be
right. The three-table drift gate compares what each table holds *today*, so
it stayed green while all six misquoted every past date they were asked about.
The wire looked correct too: a status of ``national`` and a number is exactly
what a good answer looks like.

Romania is why the fix is not "refuse whenever nothing is flagged". It holds a
genuine two-row history of one tax - 19 % closed on 2025-07-31, 21 % open from
the next day - so a question about 2020 meets a single unflagged row that
really is the standard rate of that year. It answers 19 % before this change
and after it, through the same branch, and that is asserted in the same run as
the six refusals. A fix that turned Romania red would have been a blanket
refusal wearing a fix's face.
