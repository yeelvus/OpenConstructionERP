// British English (en-GB). Overrides only, not a copy of en.ts.
//
// i18next resolves en-GB before en, so a key absent from this file is answered
// by en.ts. The same arrangement as en-US.ts, and for the same reason: a key
// copied across unchanged would have to be kept in step with en.ts forever for
// no gain.
//
// What en-GB is FOR, and it is mostly not this file. Plain `en` claims no
// region, so it prints `3/14/2026` and `$1,234.50` and starts its week on
// Sunday, because CLDR has no region-free English and unqualified `en`
// inherits the American reading. Picking English (UK) is what turns those into
// `14/03/2026`, `US$1,234.50` and a Monday-first week. Every one of those
// comes from the locale tag rather than from a string, so this file is small
// by design and would still be doing its job if it were empty.
//
// What is in it, and what is deliberately not. en.ts is not written in one
// variety: measured on 2026-09-08 it carries `colour` 29 times against `color`
// 41, `labour` 118 against `labor` 62, and `catalogue` 150 against `catalog`
// 469. So there are keys where a British reader is shown the American spelling
// and en-US.ts has nothing to override, because en.ts was already American
// there. 241 keys are in that state, over a closed list of unambiguous pairs
// (colour, labour, catalogue, organisation, cancelled, fulfil, analyse and the
// -ise verbs); `program`/`programme`, `metre`/`meter`, `licence`/`license` and
// `centre`/`center` are excluded from that count because each needs the
// sentence read rather than a rule applied.
//
// The nine below are the navigation and module labels out of those 241 - the
// words a British estimator reads on every screen rather than inside a
// paragraph. The remaining 232 are a spelling pass over prose, and they are
// left as a named piece of work rather than done by substitution: a global
// replace over 35,865 values is how a link with `/catalog` in it or a
// `program` that means software gets quietly broken, and nothing on screen
// would show it.
//
// Locale source. Edit this file directly: nothing generates it.
// ../i18n-fallbacks.ts deliberately does not import it, because the tests that
// iterate that object assume a locale carries the whole key set.
