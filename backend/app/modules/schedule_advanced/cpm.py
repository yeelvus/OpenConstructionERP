"""Pure-Python Critical Path Method (CPM) engine - Slice 1.

This module is intentionally self-contained: no SQLAlchemy, no FastAPI,
no third-party deps (no scipy / networkx). Everything is plain ``dataclass``
+ ``list`` / ``dict`` so the engine can be unit-tested in isolation and
also imported by services that want to run "what-if" scheduling.

Scope:
    * Activities with integer ``duration`` (working days).
    * All four PDM dependency types with optional integer lag (may be
      negative for lead time):

      ====  ==================  =============================================
      Code  Name                Forward-pass constraint on successor ``s``
      ====  ==================  =============================================
      FS    Finish-to-Start     ``s.ES >= p.EF + lag``
      SS    Start-to-Start      ``s.ES >= p.ES + lag``
      FF    Finish-to-Finish    ``s.EF >= p.EF + lag``
      SF    Start-to-Finish     ``s.EF >= p.ES + lag``
      ====  ==================  =============================================

      The backward pass mirrors each constraint to bound the predecessor's
      late dates (see :func:`compute_cpm`).
    * Forward pass → ES / EF.
    * Backward pass → LS / LF.
    * Total float = LS − ES (== LF − EF).
    * Free float  = max slip from early dates before any successor's early
      dates move, computed per link type (0 for terminal nodes when at the
      component finish).
    * Critical path marking (total_float <= 0).
    * Cycle detection via DFS (raises :class:`CycleError`).
    * Disconnected sub-networks supported - every weakly-connected
      component is scheduled independently from t=0.

The existing ``service.cpm_forward_backward_pass`` helper that powers the
stateless ``POST /cpm`` endpoint stays in place; this new engine is the
canonical reference implementation used by the new persisted
``compute-cpm`` endpoint and by the resource-leveling heuristic.

      finish. This is the earliest finish.

# Working-day (calendar-aware) offset arithmetic - additive helper
# ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# The CPM passes above run entirely in plain calendar-day offsets: a duration of
# ``d`` always advances an offset by exactly ``d`` (``ef = es + dur``). That is
# correct when every day is a working day, but a follow-up was noted to let the
# engine honour per-activity working calendars (skip weekends / holidays).
#
# Retrofitting that into ``compute_cpm`` is NOT a small change: the forward pass,
# backward pass, ``_forward_bound``, the free-float math, all three
# out-of-sequence forward passes and every claims-grade post-processor that
# reconstructs dates rely on the exact ``ef == es + dur`` / ``es == ef - dur``
# identity (and on ``+ lag - dur`` / ``- lag + dur`` link conversions). Honouring
# calendars means replacing every one of those with a calendar-aware inverse,
# which would destabilise the green claims-grade engine and its tests.
#
# So the calendar support starts here as a small, fully-tested, behaviour-neutral
# PRIMITIVE keyed by the same integer day-offsets the engine speaks. Nothing
# above calls it yet; a future integration can adopt it to translate a
# working-day ``duration`` into an elapsed-day finish offset and back. With the
# trivial seven-working-day calendar it reproduces plain offset arithmetic
# exactly, so adopting it is a no-op for projects without a real calendar.
#
# The inclusivity convention is identical to ``app/core/cpm.py`` and
# ``app/modules/schedule/progress_math.py`` so all three agree:
# ``working_days_between`` counts working days strictly AFTER ``start`` up to and
# INCLUDING ``end`` (exclusive start, inclusive end).

    """A pure working-day calendar that speaks the engine's integer day offsets.

    The claims-grade CPM passes carry every date as an integer offset (in
    elapsed days) from a single project epoch. This helper maps a working-day
    *duration* onto those offsets so non-working days (weekends + holidays) are
    skipped, without changing how the passes store or compare offsets.

    It is intentionally NOT the ISO-string ``WorkCalendar`` in
    ``app/modules/schedule/progress_math.py``: that one is keyed by
    ``YYYY-MM-DD`` strings, whereas the CPM engine never materialises calendar
    dates - it works in offsets relative to ``epoch``. The two share the same
    inclusivity convention so a value computed by one can be reasoned about with
    the other once an epoch is fixed.

    Attributes:
        epoch: The calendar date that offset ``0`` maps to. Offsets are elapsed
            days from this date; ``epoch`` itself need not be a working day.
        work_weekdays: Weekday indices (``0=Mon`` .. ``6=Sun``) that are working
            days. Defaults to Monday-Friday.
        holidays: ``YYYY-MM-DD`` strings that are NOT working days even when they
            fall on a working weekday.

    A calendar whose ``work_weekdays`` covers all seven days and that has no
    holidays makes every method reduce to plain integer arithmetic
    (``working_finish_offset(es, d) == es + d`` and so on), so an adopter can
    opt out of calendar effects simply by handing it such a calendar - the
    engine's current behaviour is recovered byte for byte. :data:`ALL_DAYS_CALENDAR`
