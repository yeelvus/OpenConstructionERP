// Case: "Price one bill for HST, PST and QST" (CA).
//
// Sales tax in Canada is a question about WHERE a cost sits rather than a
// percentage on the end. The same bill priced in three provinces does not just
// total differently: the tax lands inside the unit rate in one, on the invoice
// tail in another, and as two parallel lines on one base in the third. That is
// the only case in the Canadian set about a number being somewhere else rather
// than about a number being wrong. Content strings are key plus inline English
// default and live only here.

    "Canadian sales tax is a question about where a cost sits, not a percentage on the end, and that is why the same bill priced in three provinces is three differently built estimates rather than three totals. In the harmonised provinces the tax goes on the tail and comes back, so it is not a cost at all and a cost plan carrying it is overstated. In British Columbia, Saskatchewan and Manitoba the provincial part on materials is frequently a cost the contractor carries and never recovers, which puts it inside the unit rate rather than on the tail. In Quebec two taxes run in parallel on the same pre-tax base. The rates as they stand: 5 percent federal everywhere, 13 percent harmonised in Ontario, 15 percent in New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador and Prince Edward Island, 14 percent in Nova Scotia since 1 April 2025, 12 percent in British Columbia and in Manitoba, 11 percent in Saskatchewan, 14.975 percent in Quebec, and 5 percent only in Alberta and the three territories. Note the mechanical point that most bids get wrong: the Quebec tax and the British Columbia, Saskatchewan and Manitoba provincial taxes are charged on the price before the federal tax, not on a federal-tax-inclusive figure.",
