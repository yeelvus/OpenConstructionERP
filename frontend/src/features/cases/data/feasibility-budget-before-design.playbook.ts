// Case: "Estimate a feasibility budget before design".
//
// A developer or client case: put an order-of-magnitude number in front of a
// board before a single drawing exists, using a cost-per-square-metre
// benchmark and a shell of lump-sum allowances rather than a detailed
// take-off. Content strings are key plus inline English default and live only
