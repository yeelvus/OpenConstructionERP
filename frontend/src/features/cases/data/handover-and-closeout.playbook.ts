// Case: "Hand over and close out".
//
// Finish the job cleanly, in five steps: clear the punch list, confirm every
// inspection passed, close the open non-conformances, assemble the as-built
// documents and issue the signed handover. Each step points at a bespoke
// before -> after process scene (see processScenes.tsx). Content strings are a
// key plus inline English default and live only here.
