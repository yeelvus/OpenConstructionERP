"""Two ways of building the same tables have to agree on what things are called.

A fresh install gets the funding tables from ``Base.metadata.create_all``. An
install that already exists gets them from ``alembic/versions/v41_funding_module.py``.
Both are real, both ship, and neither one is checked against the other by the
migration round-trip test, which compares column names only.

Constraint and index names are where the two drift, because the migration
writes them out by hand while ``create_all`` derives them from the naming
convention in ``app.database``. Four of the six foreign keys here come out
longer than PostgreSQL's 63-character identifier limit, and SQLAlchemy silently
shortens the ones it generated itself, appending four hex characters. A name
written by hand gets no such treatment: PostgreSQL rejects it outright, which
is how the first draft of that migration was caught.

The drift that survives is quieter than the rejection. Two installs end up with
the same tables under different constraint names, and a later migration that
drops one by name does nothing on half the estate and reports success.

Primary keys are deliberately out of scope. The migration declares them through
``primary_key=True`` rather than by name, so PostgreSQL calls them
``<table>_pkey`` while ``create_all`` calls them ``pk_<table>``. That is true of
every migration in this repository, nothing drops a primary key by name, and
changing it here alone would make this module the odd one out.
