"""The bill position read back with everything recorded against it.

Two kinds of assertion here and they check different things. The pure ones
drive ``assemble_rows`` with dictionaries and prove the join and the arithmetic
without a database. The rest go through ``build_position_actuals`` against real
rows, because the join is only correct if each aggregate is keyed the way its
own module keys it, and a dictionary the test built itself cannot show that.

The zero cases matter as much as the filled ones. A position with no cost line
and a position with a cost line nothing has been spent against both report zero
money, and the two mean opposite things to the reader, so the report has to
tell them apart rather than leaving a page of zeros to be interpreted.
