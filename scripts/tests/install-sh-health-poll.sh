#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Guards the health poll in scripts/install.sh.
#
# WHAT THIS PROVES, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT
# The subject is the real text of the wait loop and the verdict, sliced out of
# the shipped scripts/install.sh between two anchors and run under the same
# shell options the script sets. No Docker and no install: these cases prove
# which branch a person is shown for a given health answer, and nothing about
# whether an install works.
#
# WHY IT EXISTS
# The poll was added with `set -euo pipefail` already in force at the top of
# install.sh, and the assignment
#
#     health=$(curl -fsS ... | tr -d ' \n')
#
# takes the exit status of the substitution. curl failing is not an error here,
# it is the normal state of every iteration before the service serves, so the
# first unanswered request killed the installer at the exact spot that was
# added to make it safer. `bash -n` cannot see this: the syntax is fine, and
# the shape only misbehaves when it runs against something that is not up yet.
# So the first case below points the loop at a closed port and asserts that the
# verdict is reached at all. It fails against the unguarded assignment.
#
# HOW TO RUN
#   bash scripts/tests/install-sh-health-poll.sh
# Exit code 0 means every case passed. Needs curl and python3.
