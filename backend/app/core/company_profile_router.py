"""Company profile API - the letterhead printed on generated documents.

    GET    /api/v1/company-profile/         - any signed-in user. The settings
                                              preview reads it, and so does an
                                              export started by a non-admin.
    GET    /api/v1/company-profile/options/ - any signed-in user. The caps the
                                              sanitiser enforces, for the form.
    PUT    /api/v1/company-profile/         - admin only. Merge and persist.
    DELETE /api/v1/company-profile/         - admin only. Clear the profile.

Deliberately NOT mounted alongside the public ``GET /api/v1/branding/`` in
:mod:`app.core.branding_router`. That endpoint answers anonymous callers,
because the login page needs the app brand before sign-in; a registered
address and a tax identifier must never be one field away from it. A router of
its own, reading a file of its own, keeps the two apart structurally rather
than by somebody remembering which keys to leave out of a response.

Persistence is a small JSON file in the data dir (see
:mod:`app.core.company_profile`) - no database table, so this needs no
migration.
