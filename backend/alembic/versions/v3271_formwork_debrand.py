"""Rename the eight trademarked rows in oe_formwork_system.

The starter formwork catalogue shipped eight rows named after real products
from four suppliers, with the supplier's own name in ``supplier``. The
catalogue source was fixed so a fresh install never sees them again, but the
seeding path keys on ``name`` and skips what already exists, so that fix
reaches nobody who already installed. A de-branding that only helps future
installs leaves every existing tenant shipping the trademarks, which is the
whole thing we set out to stop. This revision repairs the rows already
written.

There is a second reason, independent of trademark. Because seed-defaults
compares per row on ``name``, a tenant who upgrades and re-runs it today gets
the eight new rows inserted *beside* the eight old ones - sixteen rows, eight
concepts. After this revision the old names are gone, so seed-defaults skips
all eight and the duplicate path closes.

Why this is safe to run over customer data:

* **Keyed on the exact old name.** A tenant who renamed a row themselves no
  longer matches and is left alone. We do not guess at near-misses.
* **A tenant's own supplier edit survives.** ``supplier`` is only cleared
  where it still holds the original brand. If someone repointed the row at
  their own hire yard, that value stays.
* **No row is renamed onto a name already present for that tenant.** There is
  no unique constraint on ``name``, so an install that already re-ran
  seed-defaults holds both the old row and its replacement; renaming blindly
  would leave two identical names in one catalogue. Those rows are skipped and
  counted, not merged and not deleted - the old row may carry assignments, and
  deciding which of the two an assignment should point at is a judgement about
  a tenant's own data that a migration has no standing to make.
* **Nothing is invented and no price moves.** Assignments reference the
  catalogue by ``formwork_system_id``, and neither ``unit_rate`` nor
  ``erect_strike_rate`` is touched, so no rate can change under an estimate.
* **Idempotent.** The predicate stops matching once a row is renamed, so a
  second run updates zero rows.

Per-pair rowcounts are logged rather than a total. One of the eight carries a
non-ASCII character in both the name and the supplier, and if that literal
ever stops byte-matching what is in the column, the pair silently matches
nothing while the other seven succeed - a single total of "7 rows updated"
would read as success.

    Reversing this would write real company names back into tenant databases,

    removing: the revision would ship the trademarks in the source tree
    forever, in a file whose whole purpose is to take them out.

    Nor is the rename cleanly reversible even in principle. A row reading
    "Steel framed wall panel" because this revision renamed it is
    indistinguishable from one a tenant typed, or from one seed-defaults
    inserted on a fresh install, so a downgrade could not tell which rows were
    its own. Downgrading the schema is reversible; downgrading a repair is
    not, so this side is intentionally empty.
