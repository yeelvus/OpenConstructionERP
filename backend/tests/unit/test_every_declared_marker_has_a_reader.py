"""A declared marker that nothing reads is a name with no effect.

The other direction is already closed and closed harder. ``--strict-markers``
in ``backend/pyproject.toml`` turns a marker used but not declared into a
collection error, so a typo in a decorator refuses rather than warns. This file
is the remaining half: a marker DECLARED and read by nothing at all.

The obvious form of that check would be "declared and not used in any
decorator", and it is the wrong one. A marker can be entirely legitimate with
zero decorators: an escape hatch that an autouse fixture looks up with
``get_closest_marker`` is real and load-bearing on the day no test yet needs to
opt out. A rule that counted decorators alone would call that dead and be
wrong, and it would be wrong about exactly the marker whose absence is hardest
to notice.

So a marker counts as read when any of three channels mentions it: a decorator
(``pytest.mark.NAME`` in any of its forms), a runtime lookup
(``get_closest_marker``/``iter_markers``), or a lane selecting on it with
``-m``. A name in none of the three is dead config: it makes ``-m NAME`` select
nothing, which exits 5, and it makes a reader believe a category exists that
does not.

The set this finds is empty today and that is the honest outcome, not a reason
to skip the gate. What matters is that it can fail, which the accompanying test
shows by planting a marker no channel mentions.
