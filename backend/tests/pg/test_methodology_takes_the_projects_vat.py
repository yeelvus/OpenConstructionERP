"""PG: a methodology asked about a project prices that project's VAT.

VAT is a property of the transaction, not of the method. "How Germany
estimates" is a catalogue fact and the template's 19 belongs there. But
:meth:`MethodologyService.compute_estimate` takes a ``project_id`` and, through
:meth:`build_export_data`, a ``boq_id``, and at that moment it is not answering
about Germany any more. It is answering about one project's bill, and the bill
engine has honoured that project's ``default_vat_rate`` since issue #89.

The two therefore disagreed. On a million of direct cost with a project on 25
percent, the bill said 1,537,500 and the methodology said 1,463,700, and 15 of
the 20 mapped countries diverged the same way, up to 315,632 on the Gulf pair.
The agreement the parity suite reports was real but narrow: it holds on the
branch where both sides read the same VAT number, which is every project that
never set one.

The divergent figure was not confined to a screen. ``build_export_data`` prices
a real ``boq_id`` through a stored methodology and streams it as Excel or PDF,
so it left the building as a document.

What must NOT move: the catalogue answer. ``build_cascade_spec_from_template``
still prices a slug at the template rate, and a project that set no rate of its
own is not touched by a cent. The override wins only where there is a project
and a rate to win with.

Gated by ``OE_TEST_DB=pg`` (see conftest); it needs stored Project and
Methodology rows, so it cannot live in the unit lane.
