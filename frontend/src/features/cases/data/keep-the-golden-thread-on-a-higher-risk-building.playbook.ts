// Case: "Keep the golden thread on a higher-risk building" (GB).
//
// The Building Safety Act 2022 asks for building information that is
// accurate, current and findable, handed on at each gateway and again at
// occupation. The platform has no gateway form to fill in, so the case walks
// the discipline that produces the thread: stated requirements, a common data
// environment with states, a versioned register, a review cycle answered
// against pinned versions, and a handover. Content strings are key plus
// inline English default and live only here.

    "The Building Safety Act 2022 put a higher-risk building through three gateways and made somebody accountable for the information about it, from design through to occupation. That information is the golden thread, and the regime asks for it to be accurate, current and available to the people who need it, rather than merely archived somewhere nobody can search. In practice that is an information management discipline and not a document dump: what is required is stated up front, drafts are kept apart from what has been shared and what has been published, and every review is answered against the version that was actually submitted. This case builds that discipline out of what the platform holds today. It does not fill in a gateway application; it produces the record a gateway application has to be made from.",
