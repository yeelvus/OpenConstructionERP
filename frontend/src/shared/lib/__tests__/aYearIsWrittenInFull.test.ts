// No surface abbreviates a year.
//
// Measured on the published frames: the programme printed "05 Mar 26" in its
// date columns and "Aug 26" along its month axis, on a schedule running from
// 2026 into 2028. Two digits are cheap to write and expensive to read - the
// row already carries a two-digit day either side of the month, so the reader
// has to decide which of the two numbers is the year before they can use
// either, and they have to decide it again on the next row.
//
// Everywhere else in the product a date reads "Aug 12, 2026". Those two
// surfaces were the whole exception, which is why this is a census rather than
// two local fixes: the point is not that the two known sites were corrected,
// it is that the next date column starts from the same answer.
//
// If a surface ever genuinely needs the short form - a chart axis so dense
// that four digits will not fit - the honest move is to delete this test and
// say why in the message, not to slip the option past it. The rule is a
// decision, and a decision should be visible when it is reversed.
