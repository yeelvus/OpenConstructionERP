"""Unicode font registration for every reportlab-generated PDF.

OpenEstimate principle #2 is *i18n EVERYWHERE*. reportlab's built-in Type-1
fonts (Helvetica / Times / Courier) are Latin-1 only, so any PDF that renders
Cyrillic (ru, bg, uk, sr), Greek, or the many accented Latin scripts with the
default font shows empty boxes ("tofu") instead of text. A construction ERP
that ships 29 locales but prints unreadable invoices and contracts in half of
them is broken.

This module bundles **DejaVu Sans** (regular + bold) and registers it with
reportlab once per process. DejaVu covers Latin, Latin-Extended, Cyrillic and
Greek - i.e. every locale this product ships *except* the complex scripts
(Arabic, Hebrew, CJK, Thai, Devanagari), which need much larger Noto fonts and
proper bidi/shaping. For the covered scripts the fix is complete: glyphs
render, not boxes.

Chinese and Korean are handled separately and without bundling anything,
because reportlab ships CID font *metrics* for the Adobe Asian font packs and
can reference them by name. ``pdf_font_for_text`` returns the CID face for text
that needs it and the DejaVu face for everything else, so a Chinese document
does not change the face a German one prints in.

The two CID rungs overlap and their order is load bearing. Han encodes in
EUC-KR, so the Korean rung would answer for Chinese text if it were asked
first; measured against the shipped Chinese locale, 73 of 385 strings would
change face, including most of the commonest words in the UI. Chinese is asked
first, and :func:`_face_ladder` says so where the order is set.

Thai and Devanagari are bundled as embedded Noto faces. Neither has a CID pack,
so unlike Korean they could not be added for free: each needs a real face in the
repository, 73 KB and 276 KB, under the SIL Open Font License 1.1.

Those two scripts also need more than a face. A face alone fixes the boxes and
leaves the text wrong, which is the worse of the two failures because it looks
like output. Thai stacks a tone mark above an upper vowel, and the mark that
belongs above the vowel is a different glyph from the one that belongs above the
consonant; without shaping the font draws the consonant-height glyph and the two
marks collide. Devanagari stores the i-matra after its consonant and draws it
before, so without shaping the vowel appears on the wrong side of the letter.
Both are fixed by ``uharfbuzz``, which reportlab uses when it is installed, and
:func:`pdf_shaping_for_text` says which strings need it.

Shaping reaches the page through Paragraph, not through ``canvas.drawString``.
reportlab routes ``drawString(shaping=True)`` through ``bidiShapedText``, which
has two definitions, and the one selected when ``rlbidi`` is absent discards the
argument and returns the string unshaped. It does not warn. So a caller drawing
complex script straight onto the canvas gets silence and a wrong page; use
:func:`pdf_style_for_text` and a Paragraph, which calls the shaper directly and
is unaffected.

A bare string in a table is that caller without looking like one. reportlab
draws a cell that is not a flowable through ``canvas.drawString``, so the
warning above covers every such cell, and the generator that built the row
never typed the word canvas. ``TableStyle`` does carry a ``SHAPING`` op and
cells do honour ``cellstyle.shaping``, which makes this harder to catch rather
than easier: reaching for the obvious control routes into the same no-op and
reports nothing. Measured on the page, a Thai tone mark in a bare cell draws
the consonant-height glyph where the shaper calls for the raised one, and a
Devanagari i-matra draws after its consonant instead of before.

The condition to watch, which is more useful than the decision it would change:
``rlbidi`` is not priced in while the canvas route carries only table cells. If
a generator ever routes body text through the canvas directly, that route stops
being avoidable and ``rlbidi`` is worth pricing then.

**The CID face is referenced, not embedded.** A PDF using it carries the text
and the metrics but not the outlines, so it renders wherever the reader can
supply an Adobe Simplified Chinese face - which every mainstream desktop and
browser viewer does, and an offline or minimal viewer may not. That is the
trade for not carrying a 16 MB font in the repository, and it is a real
limitation rather than a footnote: a document that must render identically
everywhere needs an embedded font, which is a separate decision with a size
cost attached.

Usage in a generator::

    from app.core.pdf_fonts import BODY_FONT, BOLD_FONT, register_pdf_fonts

    register_pdf_fonts()            # idempotent; call once at the top
    canvas.setFont(BODY_FONT, 10)   # instead of "Helvetica"
    canvas.setFont(BOLD_FONT, 12)   # instead of "Helvetica-Bold"

A generator that can be handed Chinese - which in this product means any
generator that prints project names, item descriptions or party names, because
that is where Chinese arrives - asks for the face per string instead::

    from app.core.pdf_fonts import pdf_font_for_text, pdf_style_for_text, pdf_table_font_commands

    canvas.setFont(pdf_font_for_text(title, bold=True), 12)
    Paragraph(html.escape(desc), pdf_style_for_text(styles["cell"], desc))
    table.setStyle(TableStyle([*base_commands, *pdf_table_font_commands(rows)]))

Per string rather than per document on purpose. The faces cover different
scripts and none covers all of them, so a document mixing a Chinese supplier
name into German text renders correctly only if the choice is made at the string
that is being drawn.

The choice is made by asking the font, not by testing the codepoint against a
range. ``font_can_draw`` reads the TrueType character map, or a Type-1 built-in's
own encoding vector, and reports whether that face has a glyph. A string is then
given the lowest face on a ladder - the generator's existing face, then the
bundled Unicode face, then the Chinese pack - that can draw every character in
it. Two things follow, and both matter more than the tidiness. A string the old
face could already draw never leaves the first rung, so wiring a generator up
does not move a single byte of its existing Latin output. And a string the old
face could not draw escalates whatever the reason: Cyrillic and Greek get the
same treatment as Han, which a range test named for one script would never have
given them.

Known limitation, right-to-left scripts. Arabic and Hebrew escalate to the
bundled Unicode face like any other script this module cannot draw in the base
face, and that face has the glyphs, so the correct codepoints reach the content
stream and a reader can select and copy the text. What this module does not do
is lay them out. There is no bidirectional reordering and no contextual
shaping, so Arabic letters are drawn in their isolated forms rather than joined
to their neighbours, and both scripts are drawn in logical order rather than
visual order. On the page that reads backwards. The choice is deliberate: boxes
destroy the codepoints and cannot be recovered by anything downstream, whereas
this keeps the data correct and gets the presentation wrong, which is the
better failure on a document whose text has to be verifiable against the
structured data beside it. It is still wrong, and implementing bidi and shaping
is the fix.

``register_pdf_fonts()`` is safe to call from many generators and many times;
it registers at most once and never raises if the bundled TTFs are missing
(it falls back to Helvetica and logs a warning, so PDF generation degrades
rather than crashing).

#: These are the faces as their authors published them, and they must stay that
#: way. Subsetting at embed time is ordinary use and reportlab already does it,
#: so the PDF carries only the glyphs a document needs and nothing here makes
#: the output bigger. Subsetting the file *in the repository* is a different
#: act: it produces a modified face, and the OFL binds "in part or in whole", so
#: the cut-down file would still have to travel with its licence and copyright.
#: The practical reason is plainer. A face cut to the glyphs some sample needed
#: silently fails to draw anything outside that set, and the failure looks
#: exactly like the box-glyph bug these faces were added to fix. Leave them
#: whole.
#: They live in a subdirectory of their own, with their licence texts beside
#: them, and that is load bearing rather than tidy. The guard that checks every
#: shipped font has resolvable licence text picks between several licences in
#: one directory by longest shared filename prefix, and ``LICENSE_DEJAVU``
#: shares no prefix with ``DejaVuSans``. It resolved only because it was the
#: sole candidate in that directory. Dropping two more licence files beside it
#: made all three score nothing and left every font in the folder unattributable,
#: DejaVu included. One directory per vendor keeps each family's licence the
#: unambiguous answer for its own fonts and leaves DejaVu exactly as it was.

    passes. Append the returned commands after the table's own style and the

    ``base`` is the face those cells are drawn in today. A cell that face can

    uses, and note that this is rarely one face: a table that names a
    ``FONTNAME`` for its header row and none for its body has a bold Unicode
    header sitting on top of a body that reportlab draws in **Helvetica**,

    Give the header rows with ``header_rows`` and ``header_base`` so they are
    measured against the face they really have. Getting that wrong is not
    harmless: a header already drawn in a bold Unicode face would otherwise be
    handed a command putting it back to the regular weight.

    Cells holding a flowable (a ``Paragraph``) are skipped, because a flowable
    draws itself with its own style and a ``FONTNAME`` command would not reach
    it anyway. Give those the treatment from :func:`pdf_style_for_text`.

    **These commands choose a face. They do not shape.** A bare cell is drawn
    through ``canvas.drawString``, where reportlab drops its shaping argument

    and a Frame pads by six points on each side, so a table built to

    Measured on a landscape A4 frame at the size a dashboard export draws
    at: thirty columns are narrow but drawn, forty make the header row
    taller than the frame and reportlab refuses the table, and eighty
    leave each column narrower than its own padding, at which point
    reportlab is handed a negative content width and raises. The caller
    that hits this is not a stress test - a KPI grouped by a free-text
    field becomes one column per group.

    So the count comes back here and the caller decides what to do with
    the columns beyond it, which has to be something a reader can see:
    dropping them quietly would be a worse defect than the crash.

    The answer is the widest leading run of columns that
    :func:`pdf_table_column_widths` would not squeeze below the legibility
    floor - not ``available`` divided by that floor. The difference
    matters: twenty short columns fit the frame at their own widths with
    room to spare, and a flat division would throw four of them away to
    fix a problem they do not have. Dropping a column only ever frees
    room, so the property is monotone in the count and the answer is found
    by halving rather than by trying every prefix.

    At least one column always comes back, even where the frame cannot
    hold one legibly, because a squeezed column beats a blank page.

    A table built without ``colWidths`` is sized by reportlab, and neither of
    the two answers it gives is the one a report wants. With bare string cells
    it sizes each column to its longest string and lets the table grow, so a
    wide export is drawn past the edge of the sheet; nothing raises, nothing is
    logged, and the file still extracts every column, which is exactly why that
    goes unnoticed. With flowable cells it does the opposite and spreads the
    columns across the whole frame, so a two column export that fits
    comfortably today would be stretched out to the margins. Passing widths is
    what avoids both.

    When the natural widths fit, they come back unchanged and the table is laid
    out as it is now. When they do not, the overflow is taken from the wide
    columns only: every column narrower than an equal share keeps its natural
    width, and what remains is divided among the rest, repeatedly, until the
    division holds. A label column stays legible and the prose column beside it

    A bare cell cannot wrap. reportlab draws it with ``canvas.drawString`` at
    the column's left edge and lets it run on, so a value longer than its
    column is printed over the column beside it, and a table wider than its
    frame is printed off the paper. A Paragraph wraps, and it is also the path
    that shapes, so the same text a bare cell mis-arranges comes out correct
    here.

    Because a Paragraph shapes its own text, cells have to arrive raw. Handing
    the output of :func:`pdf_table_shaped_rows` to this function would shape a
    second time, and shaping twice is destructive rather than idempotent: a
    Thai stack that became a private use codepoint on the first pass becomes
    U+FFFF on the second, which no face draws and nothing downstream can
    recover. That is refused loudly here, because it is invisible on the page
    it produces.

    Cell text is escaped, since a Paragraph parses its argument as markup where
    a bare cell took it literally, and these cells carry whatever a query
    returned. Newlines become line breaks: a bare cell drew them as line
    breaks, and a Paragraph would otherwise collapse them into spaces.

    A ``TableStyle`` cannot reach these cells once they are Paragraphs.
    FONTNAME, FONTSIZE, TEXTCOLOR and ALIGN are read from the paragraph's own
    style, so a table that named a bold label column, a right aligned money
    column or a white header through table commands keeps saying so and stops
    being obeyed. Those commands become dead the moment a cell is wrapped, and
    dead quietly: the text is still on the page, in the wrong weight, the wrong
    alignment, or in black on a dark fill. ``style_for`` is where that intent
    moves to, and a table converted to this path should have its inert commands
    deleted rather than left behind to describe a layout that is no longer
    happening.

    Args:
        rows: The table's cells. Cells that are not strings are left alone.

        header_rows: How many leading rows use ``header_style``.

            cell. Return a style to draw that cell with, or ``None`` to keep
            the row's style. This is how per column and per row appearance
            survives the move off table commands.
