"""A photo category has to mean the same thing at all three places that state it.

The module said it three times and one of them disagreed. Uploading validated
against ``VALID_PHOTO_CATEGORIES`` in the service, which listed ``aerial``;
editing validated against a pattern written out by hand in the schema, which did
not; and the gallery offered ``aerial`` in its picker, gave it its own badge
colour and shipped a translated label for it in every locale. So a drone shot
could be uploaded, shown and filtered, and the moment anyone set that category
from the photo editor the API answered 422. Nothing in the module could see the
disagreement, because each of the three lists was locally consistent.

The schema owns the set now and the other two are checked against it here. The
frontend one is read out of the TypeScript union rather than mirrored into
Python: a copy in a fixture would be a fourth statement of the same thing and
would drift the same way.
