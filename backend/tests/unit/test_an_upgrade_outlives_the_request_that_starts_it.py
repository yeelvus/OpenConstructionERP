"""An upgrade takes longer than any browser waits, so it cannot be a request.

Downloading a release, resolving its dependencies and installing them takes as
long as it takes. The client gave up at 45 seconds and told the user the
upgrade had failed, over an upgrade that was still running and would go on to
succeed (issue #430). The work also ran inline in the event loop of a single
worker, so for its whole duration the server answered nothing at all.

These tests hold the job machinery to the three things that makes true: one
upgrade at a time, a failure that can be read rather than guessed at, and a
runner that never raises, because its caller is a background task whose
exception nobody would ever see.
