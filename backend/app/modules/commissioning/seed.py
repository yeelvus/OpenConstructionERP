"""Commissioning demo seed - a populated Cx register per demo project.

Commissioning shipped routed, permissioned and empty, so every demo project
opened the page on the same "no systems yet" card. This fills it with the
register a commissioning authority actually keeps: seven to sixteen
commissionable systems per project, each with its prefunctional and functional
checklist, the results recorded against those checks, and the deficiencies
raised against the system.

What a reader sees on the screen afterwards is a building being handed over
system by system. Some systems have not been energised yet, some are part way
through their functional tests, some have finished testing and are waiting -
one because a critical deficiency is still open, another because the
commissioning certificate has simply not been issued yet - and some are
commissioned and dated.

The register is coherent rather than merely non-empty:

* every check reads like a check for *that* system. An air handling unit is
  asked about its economiser changeover and a fire alarm panel about its
  detector-to-zone map, because the checks come from a per-system-type
  catalogue rather than one generic list;
* a system's lifecycle label agrees with its own results. Every
  ``commissioned`` system passes :func:`compute_readiness` - the same gate the
  ``commission`` action applies - so nothing on the screen claims a system was
  signed off while an item is still open or a critical deficiency unresolved;
* a functional item that failed has a matching open deficiency, and a closed
  deficiency carries its resolution, its closer and its closing date.

Dates are anchored to the run date, never hardcoded, so a demo opened a year
from now still shows a building commissioned over the last few months.

Idempotent per project: a project that already carries a commissionable system
is left untouched, so a re-run never doubles the register.
