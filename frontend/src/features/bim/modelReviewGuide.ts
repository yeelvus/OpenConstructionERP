/**
 * "How it works" guide for Model Review.
 *
 * The page is a meeting surface, not a register, and the guide says so in the
 * first line: this is where a coordination review is held against the model,
 * and it ends in a hand-over. Every key carries its inline English default and
 * is consumed via `t(key, { defaultValue })`, so none of these keys live in a
 * locale file. Spotlight selectors point at live controls on ModelReviewPage.
