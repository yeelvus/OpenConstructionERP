"""Architecture Map API routes.

Read-only endpoints that serve the architecture manifest JSON and provide
search/filter capabilities over modules, connections, and statistics.

Security model
--------------
The manifest leaks substantial structural detail about the deployed
system: every module's file list, every ORM model + table name + column
SQL type, inter-module dependency edges, registered routes. That is
high-signal intelligence for an attacker mapping an unknown ERP instance
and offers no value to estimators / project managers.

Therefore every endpoint requires the ``architecture.read`` permission,
which is registered at ``Role.ADMIN`` in
:mod:`app.modules.architecture_map.permissions`. ``RequirePermission``
returns 403 to anyone below the bar.

The ``?refresh=true`` query parameter - which forces re-reading a 1+ MB
JSON file from disk - is additionally gated to admins via the same
permission check (a non-admin path is impossible because the router-wide
dependency blocks them first). This prevents a non-admin DoS vector
where any logged-in user could hammer the endpoint and starve the event
loop with synchronous file I/O.

What the manifest can and cannot answer
---------------------------------------
Everything below is derived from the file
``frontend/src/features/architecture/architecture_manifest.json``, which
``scripts/generate_architecture_manifest.py`` produces by scanning the
tree. That file is the only source, so an endpoint can only answer a
question the file actually contains.

Until this was fixed, every endpoint except ``GET /`` was written
against a different schema: it read ``connections``, ``layers`` and
``categories`` at the top level and matched modules on ``id``. The file
has none of those. It carries ``_meta``, ``dependency_graph``,
``frontend_backend_mapping``, ``frontend_features``, ``modules`` and
``statistics``, and a module is keyed by ``module_id``. Because every
read went through ``dict.get`` with a default, nothing raised:
``/modules/{module_id}`` returned 404 for all 195 modules that exist and
the rest returned empty lists, silently and for as long as the code had
been shipped. The routes are now read against the real keys:

* Connections are derived from ``dependency_graph``, which maps each
  module id to the list of module ids it imports.
* Categories are derived from the distinct ``module_category`` values
  the modules already carry.
* A module is found by ``module_id``, and searched over ``module_id``,
  ``module_label``, ``module_category`` and its plugin manifest's
  description.

One concept was removed rather than repaired. There is no ``layer``
anywhere in the manifest: no module carries the key and there is no
top-level collection of layers, so the ``layer`` filter, the ``layers``
search group and the ``modules_by_layer`` / ``total_layers`` counters
had no source and never could have had one. Answering them with an
empty list would have been indistinguishable from a real answer of
"none", which is how this defect stayed invisible in the first place, so
they are gone. If layers are wanted, the generator has to emit them
first.

Endpoints:
    GET  /                     -- Full architecture manifest
    GET  /modules              -- List modules, filterable by category
    GET  /modules/{module_id}  -- Single module detail
    GET  /connections          -- List dependency edges, filterable
    GET  /search?q=            -- Fuzzy search across modules and edges
    GET  /stats                -- Aggregate statistics
