"""Formwork business logic.

Centralises the reuse-aware rate build-up so every caller (router, import
wizard, BOQ rollup) shares one source of truth for what a formwork rate is:

    material unit cost = unit_rate * (1 + waste_pct/100) / reuse_count
    labour unit cost   = erect_strike_rate
    unit cost          = material + labour
    total              = area_m2 * unit cost

The two halves matter because only the first one amortises. Panels are bought
once and turned around ``reuse_count`` times; the labour and consumables to
set and strike them are paid on every one of those turnarounds.

``rate_basis`` decides whether the first line amortises at all: a purchase
rate is divided by the reuses, a per-use hire rate and an all-in subcontract
rate are already per-use and are not divided again.

Five things follow from that, and this module owns all five:

* choosing the system is the decision the module exists to support, so every
  candidate is priced against one set of assumptions by one function
  (:meth:`FormworkService.compare_systems`) rather than by whatever arithmetic
  a client happens to implement;
* a priced assignment can leave for the bill
  (:meth:`FormworkService.push_assignment_to_boq`), because a calculation that
  never reaches the tender is a calculator, not a module;
* a catalogue rate change re-prices every assignment that depends on it
  (:meth:`FormworkService.reprice_for_system`), because a stored total that no
  longer matches its own catalogue row is worse than no total at all;
* the pour schedule, not the estimator's memory, decides how many reuses the
  programme actually delivers (:meth:`FormworkService.analyse_cycle`);
* every assignment can be validated against the ``formwork`` rule set before
  its rate reaches the bill (:meth:`FormworkService.validate_assignment`).

        unit     = material + labour
        total    = area_m2 * unit

    Waste applies to the panel cost only. Over-ordering covers offcuts and
    damaged panels; it does not buy extra erect-and-strike labour, which is
    driven by the area formed and is paid on every reuse. That is why the
    labour component is NOT divided by ``reuse_count``: forming 1000 m2 with a
    100 m2 set means ten sets of erect-and-strike, not one.

    ``rate_basis`` decides whether the panel component amortises at all, and
    it is the only input that changes the shape of the formula:

    * ``purchase`` - the rate buys the panels. Divide by ``reuse_count``.
    * ``hire_per_use`` / ``subcontract`` - the rate is quoted PER USE already,
      so the divisor is 1:

          material = unit_rate * (1 + waste_pct/100)

      Dividing a per-use price by the reuse count would amortise a number that
      was never a capital cost, and the answer would fall as the estimator
      claimed more reuses even though the invoice does not. That is the whole
      reason this argument exists rather than being a label on the catalogue
      row. A monthly hire rate is a third model - it needs a duration on site,
      not a reuse count - and is deliberately NOT accepted here.

    An unrecognised basis falls back to ``purchase`` rather than raising: the
    schema pattern already rejects unknown values on the way in, and a stored
    row from a future revision should keep pricing the way it always did
    instead of taking a re-pricing sweep down with it.

    Every component is persisted and shown, so each is rounded to 2 dp before
    the next one uses it, and ``total`` is derived from the **rounded**
    ``unit_cost``. Otherwise ``area_m2 * computed_unit_cost`` recomputed
    client-side would not match the stored ``computed_total`` whenever the
    quotient carried fractional cents (unit_rate 65.00, waste 5 percent,
    reuse 2 gives 34.125, where area 100 stored 3412.50 against a displayed
    3413.00).

        cannot be made against a list of names, only against numbers computed

        Every candidate is priced at the SAME ``reuse_count``. Pricing each

        assumption constant and reporting each system's own limit alongside
        turns that into the useful statement instead: this system is cheaper,
        and this one cannot actually deliver what you assumed.

        Two winners are named because they can differ, and the difference is
        the interesting part: ``cheapest_system_id`` is the lowest total of
        all, ``cheapest_buildable_system_id`` is the lowest total among the

        When the assignments resolve to more than one catalogue currency the
        currency is reported blank and ``currency_mixed`` is set: the totals
        are still returned (a caller that only wants areas should not be
        blocked) but they are a sum of unlike units and the
        ``formwork.currency_consistent`` rule says so in the validation report.
