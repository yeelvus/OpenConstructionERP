"""OGC API - Features (Part 1: Core) over the geometry Geo Hub already stores.

Why this exists
---------------
Every GIS client on the planet - QGIS, ArcGIS Pro, GDAL/OGR, Leaflet,
MapLibre, FME - speaks OGC API - Features. Until now the only way to look
at our coordinates from outside the product was to point a client at the
PostgreSQL database directly, which throws away the per-project access
model, the tenant isolation and the audit trail in one move. This module
serves the same rows through the same permission gate the rest of
``geo_hub`` uses, so "open it in QGIS" costs a URL and a token instead of
a database credential.

What it is NOT
--------------
There is no PostGIS here and none is wanted. Every collection is built
from plain columns (``Numeric`` latitude / longitude) and from the JSON
``FeatureCollection`` that ``GeoOverlay`` already carries, so the service
runs on the same single PostgreSQL that the rest of the platform needs
and adds no dependency.

Collections
-----------
``project-anchors``
    One point per locatable project, straight out of
    :meth:`GeoHubService.list_anchored_projects` - the same query that
    feeds the global map, so the two can never disagree about which
    projects have a location.
``geo-overlays``
    Every ``GeoOverlay`` row, exploded into its individual features.
    These are already real GeoJSON: hand-drawn boundaries, imported KML,
    flood and risk zones, and the pins the cross-module subscribers drop.
``viewpoints``
    Saved camera positions, as points at the camera's ground coordinates.

Scope and paging
----------------
Collections span every project the caller can read (owned or team
member; admins see all), archived projects excluded, exactly as the
global map does. Pass the non-standard ``project_id`` parameter to narrow
to one project - OGC API - Features permits additional parameters and
this is far kinder to a QGIS user than one collection per project.

``bbox`` is an envelope test: a feature matches when its bounding
rectangle intersects the requested one. That is the usual simple-server
reading of the standard and it is a superset of true intersection, so
nothing that should match is dropped.

To keep a single request bounded on a 2 GB VPS the service reads at most
:data:`MAX_SCAN_ROWS` rows per collection before filtering. When a scan
hits that ceiling the response omits ``numberMatched`` rather than
reporting a number it cannot stand behind - the standard permits the
omission, and a wrong count would make a client page into nothing.
