/**
 * Canonical module page top block (MODULE_STYLE_GUIDE.md section 2).
 *
 * The module NAME and ICON live in the top app bar (Header + routeIcons) -
 * they are never repeated inside the page. What a page renders at the top is
 * exactly this, in this order:
 *
 *   1. `Breadcrumb` - only when it has depth (project link / detail trail);
 *      the shared component hides single-item trails by itself.
 *   2. THIS component: one muted subtitle sentence (what the module does)
 *      on the left, the page actions on the right.
 *   3. `DismissibleInfo` - the collapsible "Module information" card.
 *
 * Keeping every page on this exact block is what makes the app read as one
 * product instead of ~90 hand-rolled headers.

  /**
   * Accessible page heading for screen readers. The top bar is meant to show
   * the same words, and `Header.titleKeys.test.ts` is what holds the two
   * together: it pairs this key with the route's `TITLE_I18N_MAP` entry and
   * fails when they differ. Pass the key the module names itself by, normally
   * `<module>.title`, not a `nav.*` variant of it.
   *
   * The parenthetical here once simply stated the top bar shows it, which was
   * untrue on four screens: this heading said "Site prep", "Interface
   * management", "RFIs", "Risk Register" while the bar above said "Site
   * Mobilisation", "Interface Register", "RFI", "Risks". Since the element is
   * `sr-only`, no one reader saw both, so it read as correct to everybody.
