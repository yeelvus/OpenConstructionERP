"""An approved change order moves the budget by its own amount, once.

The approval writes one budget delta row per change order, and the finance
dashboard, the EVM snapshot and the impact preview all read the budget through
``BudgetRepository.aggregate_for_dashboard``, which sums every row of the
project. A delta row therefore has to carry only the change: ``original`` 0 and
``revised`` the change order's effect. That is what the row carried from
v2.9.17 until 17.7.0.

17.7.0 changed the create path to carry the project budget forward as the
row's ``original`` and to write ``revised`` as that plus the effect. It was
meant for a project with no baseline rows, whose Finance tab showed a total
budget of zero once a change order had been approved. The aggregator sums the
carried figure once per change order, so a 100 000 budget with two change
orders of 10 000 and 5 000 came out as 310 000 original and 325 000 revised,
or 210 000 and 225 000 without a baseline row. The right answer is 100 000 and
115 000 in both cases, and the table below is that answer through the real
service, the real repository and the real dashboard.

The project without baseline rows is the case 17.7.0 set out to fix, and it
stays fixed: the aggregator takes the original budget from the project's own
budget figure when change order rows are all the project has.
