// Case: "Measure the drawing into a coded bill item" (CN).
//
// Measurement under the bill of quantities valuation code produces something
// more particular than a number. It produces a bill item that carries its code
// from the national schedule and, beside the code, the statement of what the
// item covers - the grade, the thickness, the mix, the finish, the method. That
// statement is the ground for what the rate includes, and most final-account
// arguments in China start with one that did not say enough.
//
// So the case is measurement plus the two things that have to travel with the
// quantity, and it ends on validation, which reads the code and reports on its
// form. The distinction between a well-formed code and a code that exists in
// the national schedule is kept explicit, because a case about landing a
// CORRECT item cannot let the reader hear one as the other. Content strings are
// key plus inline English default and live only here.

Two bidders pricing the same code can be pricing very different work if one of them read C30 and the other read C40 into an item that said neither, and the argument surfaces at settlement rather than at tender. This case takes the measurement from the drawing to a coded item with its characteristics written down, and finishes on validation so a malformed code is found by you rather than by the owner's reviewer.",
