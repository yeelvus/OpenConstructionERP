"""WebSocket tests for the notifications push channel.

The channel had no test of its own. It is server-push only, so what is worth
covering is the handshake policy and the keep-alive loop: who is let in, and
what the loop does with a frame it did not expect.

Uses Starlette's ``TestClient.websocket_connect`` because ``httpx`` has no
WebSocket transport, and enters the app lifespan through the ``with`` block so
module loading, and therefore route mounting, happens before any request is
made. Without that the route does not exist yet: at construction the app
carries 85 routes and no sockets at all.

    The keep-alive loop used to read with ``receive_text()``, which raises
    ``KeyError('text')`` when the frame carries ``bytes`` rather than text.
    That unwound into the handler's catch-all, logged "notifications websocket
    crashed" and dropped the socket, so the user stopped receiving pushes until
    something reconnected them. Any client can send one in a line, and it means
    nothing on this channel, so the loop ignores it exactly as it ignores an
    unrecognised text frame.

    The ping afterwards is the assertion: it is answered only if the socket
    survived. Measured against the unfixed handler, this test does not fail
    fast - it STALLS. The handler returned without closing, so no close frame
    ever reached the client and the receive below waited forever. It is the
    per-test timeout that turns that into a red test, so do not read a hang
    here as a flake or an environment problem; it is this defect coming back.
