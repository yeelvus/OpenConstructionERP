"""Teams ORM models.

Tables:
    oe_teams_team          - project teams for entity visibility
    oe_teams_membership    - user-to-team membership
    oe_teams_visibility    - entity-to-team visibility restrictions
    oe_teams_roster_member - who is on the project, and in what capacity

Membership and roster are not the same thing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
``TeamMembership`` is the authorization table: a row in it is what lets a user
reach the project at all, which is why roughly two dozen modules read it through
:func:`app.modules.teams.access.member_project_ids_subquery`. It therefore holds
platform users and nothing else.

``RosterMember`` is the site record: who is working on this job, for which firm,
in which trade, in which role, between which dates, and with which tickets. Most
of those people are not platform users - the subcontractor's foreman and the
client's representative have no login - so a roster row carries its own name and
links to a user or a contact only when one exists. A roster row grants nothing.
The two are kept apart deliberately: making ``user_id`` nullable so one table
could do both jobs would void ``uq_teams_membership_team_user`` (NULLs are
distinct), and every membership-to-user join in the platform would start
rendering nameless members and counting them as viewers.

Visibility semantics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
``EntityVisibility`` rows RESTRICT, they never grant. A record with no row is
open to everyone who can already reach its project; a record with one or more
rows is reachable only by the project owner, a system admin, and the members of
the named teams. There is deliberately no direction in which a row widens what a
user can see, so no team assignment can hand out access the user did not already
hold on the parent project. See :mod:`app.modules.teams.access` for the
subtractive resolver every consumer is expected to use.

    mean two answers to "who is this", and the resolver would have to pick one.

    team link is ``ON DELETE SET NULL`` - deleting a team must not delete the
    people, they are still on the project - and an ORM collection with that
    ondelete needs ``passive_deletes`` plus foreign keys actually enforced by
    the engine to behave. :meth:`TeamRepository.unassign_roster_from_team`
    clears the column explicitly instead, which reaches the same state on every
    engine and is visible in the code that deletes the team.
