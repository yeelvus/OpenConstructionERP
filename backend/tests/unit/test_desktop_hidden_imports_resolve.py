"""Guard: every ``app.*`` hidden import in the desktop spec names a real file.

PyInstaller reports a hidden import it cannot find and keeps going:

    ERROR: Hidden import 'app.modules.<name>.repository' not found

The sidecar build for 15.4.0 printed 167 of those, and all 167 were invented by
``desktop/pyinstaller.spec`` itself: the module auto-discovery loop named six
layers for each of the 191 module packages whether or not the files existed.
Nothing was missing and nothing was broken, which is exactly what made it
dangerous. A dependency that really is absent from the frozen sidecar announces
itself in the same words, on the same channel, and it would have arrived as one
more line in a wall of them. The founder-visible end of that is a user with a
broken install and a build log that could not warn anyone.

The spec now asks the disk before it names a layer, so the channel is quiet and
a line on it means something. This test holds that open in both directions.

What it proves and what it does not: it proves the spec generates no ``app.*``
hidden import that the source tree cannot back. It says nothing about a build
log being clean, and it cannot - the residual noise on a real build comes from
upstream hooks (psycopg2's probe for MySQLdb / pysqlite2 / mx.DateTime,
pycparser's generated lextab / yacctab, scipy's _cdflib, torch's optional
tensorboard, nvcuda.dll on a machine with no CUDA) and none of that is ours to
declare.

The last test covers the other route into the bundle. ``module_loader`` imports
some layers by name under ``contextlib.suppress(ModuleNotFoundError)``, so if
one of those does not resolve inside the frozen sidecar the module simply never
registers its subscribers, with no error and no log line. Measured against the
published 15.4.0 Windows installer, 23 ``events.py``, 3 ``validators.py`` and
the single ``pipeline_nodes.py`` are absent from the PYZ and reach the bundle
only as source, carried by the ``backend/app`` tree in ``datas``. They do
resolve: PyInstaller's frozen path finder falls back to python's FileFinder on
the same directory, which is where that tree lands. That makes the ``datas``
line load-bearing for imports and not only for data, which is not what it says
about itself, so the test below fails if it is ever narrowed.

There is a second direction, and for a long time nothing here could see it.
Everything above asks whether a name the spec declares is backed by a file.
Nothing asked the reverse - whether a file the backend reaches for by name is
declared - and the one helper that looked like it could, ``_module_layers``,
reads the tuple out of the spec itself. A seventh layer the spec had never
heard of could not fail a gate that takes its expectation from the spec. That
shape answers the same on a correct tree and on a broken one.

``data_repairs.py`` walked into exactly that hole. It walks ``app.modules`` and
imports ``<name>.repairs`` by name, and ``repairs`` appeared in no layer tuple
anywhere. It did resolve, through the ``datas`` tree described above, which is
the luck this file already documents rather than a design. Had it not, the
repair pass would have registered nothing, attempted nothing, failed nothing,
and left the health endpoint describing a clean boot on the desktop build -
the only install route that ships no migration tree at all.

So the expectation now comes from the backend source rather than from the spec.
Every f-string under ``backend/app`` shaped like ``app.modules.{...}.<layer>``
is parsed out, including the ones whose layer name sits behind a module-level
constant, and the spec has to declare every one of those layers that some
module actually carries a file for. Frequency on disk deliberately plays no
part: ``repairs.py`` exists in two modules against 189 manifests, so any rule
keyed on how common a filename is would rank the layer that most needs naming
with the one-off helpers.

Two things stop that direction going green on an empty read, because it is an
EXISTS-direction gate and those fail open. It carries floors on how much it
examined - source files, layer names, module packages - and a control feeds the
scanner a fixture holding a literal slot, a constant slot and a slot it cannot
resolve. The constant branch is the only one that reaches ``repairs``, so it
has to keep working or the control goes red. An f-string of the right shape
whose layer cannot be resolved is reported as a failure rather than skipped;
that is the one place a future rewrite could hide a layer from this gate, and
it is loud.

It is a pure file-parsing test - the spec is executed with PyInstaller's own
symbols stubbed out, no application import, no build - so it runs anywhere the
suite is collected.
