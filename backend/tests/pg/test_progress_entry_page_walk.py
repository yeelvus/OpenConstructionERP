"""PG: walking the progress register's pages returns every entry exactly once.

``ProgressRepository.list_entries_for_project`` pages with OFFSET/LIMIT and
used to order by ``recorded_at`` alone. That is not a total order over this
table: ``recorded_at`` defaults to the DB's ``now()``, which in PostgreSQL is
the TRANSACTION timestamp, so every entry a single write appends carries the
same value - and a bulk field import appends many. Under a partial order the
database may arrange the tied rows differently for each OFFSET it serves, so a
walk through the pages can hand back one entry twice and never return another,
with each page looking perfectly correct on its own.

The fix adds ``seq`` as a second key. It is NOT NULL and unique per INSERT
(see :func:`app.modules.progress.repository._latest_first` and migration
``v3258_progress_entry_seq``), so the order becomes total and the walk exact.

What each test here is worth, measured rather than assumed: the three page
walks all PASS against the unfixed query. ``ix_progress_entry_project_recorded``
covers ``(project_id, recorded_at)``, so PostgreSQL answers them from an index
scan whose tied rows come back in a stable physical order, and the wrong query
returns the right answer at fixture size. They are kept as documentation of
the contract, not as its guard.
:func:`test_the_page_order_ends_on_a_column_that_cannot_tie` is the guard: it
asserts the property OFFSET actually depends on, which is that the last
ordering key cannot tie, and it fails the moment ``seq`` leaves the tuple.

Real PostgreSQL because ``seq`` is a sequence-backed server default: on a
dialect without it the column these tests turn on does not populate at all.

Gated by ``OE_TEST_DB=pg`` (see conftest).
