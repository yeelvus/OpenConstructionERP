"""Internationalization Foundation permission definitions.

Eight routes in this module write. The ECB exchange-rate fetch reaches out to
the European Central Bank and stores every new daily reference rate it finds;
the other seven create, update and delete exchange rates, work calendars and
tax configurations by hand. Everything else here reads.

The fetch used to be gated on the bare literal ``"admin"``, which no module
ever registers. ``RequirePermission`` returns False for an unknown key and
admin short-circuits above that check, so the route behaved as admin-only and
no test could see the difference, because the fixtures authenticate as an
admin. The cost was invisible in the same way: the admin permission matrix
could never delegate this route, since ``set_min_role`` on an unregistered key
raises.

The other seven had the opposite defect and it lasted longer. They asked for
authentication and never for authorisation - each took a ``CurrentUserId`` it
underscore-prefixed and never read - so any account of any role could rewrite
them. Authentication was never the missing piece.

ADMIN throughout rather than MANAGER, because none of these three tables has a
tenant, owner or project column: every row is global to the install, so the
permission is the whole guard and there is no ownership check underneath it to
fall back on. Changing a VAT rate here changes what every tenant's estimates
and invoices are computed from, which makes it an install-level administrative
act rather than an ordinary write.
