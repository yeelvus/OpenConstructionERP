# DDC-CWICR-OE: DataDrivenConstruction - OpenConstructionERP
"""Domain model for post-calculation (Nachkalkulation) productivity analysis.

Post-calculation closes the loop of an estimate. The estimate side says how many
labour hours a unit of work *should* take (the norm baked into every priced
position's resource split); the site side records how many hours were *actually*
booked and how much was *actually* installed. Comparing the two per BoQ line, per
resource and across the project tells an estimator where the norms held and where
they did not - and hands back a concrete list of productivity factors to feed into
the next estimate.

Everything here is a plain dataclass plus its ``to_dict`` and a Markdown renderer.
It is ``Decimal``-exact and carries no ORM, database or FastAPI dependency, so the
whole model is trivially constructed and asserted from plain values, exactly like
the ``price_breakdown`` and ``resource_summary`` libraries. The compute that fills
these structures lives in :mod:`app.modules.postcalc.service`.

Key quantity, the productivity factor:

    planned_hours_per_unit = planned_labour_hours / planned_quantity
    actual_hours_per_unit  = actual_labour_hours  / actual_quantity (installed)
    productivity_factor    = actual_hours_per_unit / planned_hours_per_unit
                           = actual_labour_hours / earned_hours

where ``earned_hours = planned_hours_per_unit * actual_quantity`` is the hours the
estimate budgeted for the quantity that was actually installed. A factor above 1
means the crew spent more hours than the estimate allowed for the work done
(under-productive); below 1 means fewer (over-productive). Money is never a float.

class LineProductivity:
    """Planned-vs-actual labour productivity for one BoQ line.

    Labour hours are the classic post-calculation metric: an estimate's unit rate
    is built on a labour norm (hours per unit), and the site books the hours it
    actually took. This compares the two for the quantity that was actually
    installed. Plant and subcontract demand roll up per category in
    :class:`ResourceProductivity`; this line view carries the labour factor an
    estimator tunes and, beside it, the material money - the half of a position
    that usually loses the money and that a labour factor alone cannot see.

    Material is compared on cost only, never on quantity. A position is measured
    in one unit and the material issued against it in another (the bill prices
    "m2" of formwork while the store counts "pcs" of panels), so a quantity delta
    across the two would be arithmetic on two different things. Money has no such
    problem. ``actual_material_cost`` is ``None`` - unknown, not zero - wherever
    the site recorded no priced consumption for the line.

    Two comparisons are offered for each of the two money categories, and they
    answer different questions. ``*_cost_variance`` is against the whole line as
    priced, which is the budget question. The ``*_cost_variance_earned``
    properties are against ``earned_*_cost``, the money the estimate allowed for
    the quantity that was actually installed, which is the performance question
    and the only fair one on a line that is half built.
