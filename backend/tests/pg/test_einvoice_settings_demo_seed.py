"""The E-Rechnung settings screen is filled on the install whose invoice passes.

The German showcase preflight found the two halves disagreeing: the seeded
invoice exports a green XRechnung because it carries the seller in its own
``metadata["einvoice"]``, while /settings shows an empty form because the
standing configuration is created lazily and starts blank. A visitor is then
told the document is complete and shown nothing behind it.

What is pinned here is the join, not the values: the settings must hold the
seller the invoice actually names, resolved from that invoice rather than
restated in the seeder, so the screen and the document cannot drift into naming
two different companies. Plus the two properties that make it safe to run on
every boot - a field a user typed survives, and a project whose showcase invoice
is missing gets a log line instead of a half-filled configuration.
