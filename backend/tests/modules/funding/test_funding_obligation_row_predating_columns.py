"""An obligation written before ``detail_key`` existed must still be readable.

``detail_key`` and ``detail_params`` are newer than ``oe_funding_obligation``.
Every installation upgrading to this version has rows that predate them, and
on one that reaches the columns through the boot heal rather than the
migration the two do not arrive alike. Measured on such a database:
``detail_key`` is NOT NULL with ``DEFAULT ''`` and ``detail_params`` is
nullable with no default. ``default=""`` on the model is a scalar the heal can
render into DDL; ``default=dict`` is a callable it cannot, so that column
arrives with no default and is therefore nullable. An old row reads back with
an empty ``detail_key`` and a ``None`` ``detail_params``.

``ObligationOut`` declares ``detail_params`` as a ``dict``. Without a coercion
``model_validate`` raises on the first such row, and because the endpoint
builds the whole list in one comprehension, one old row takes the entire
deadline list to a 500.

It failed silently in a way worth remembering: the page still rendered. The
summary endpoint counts open obligations with its own query and answered 200,
so the KPI said two deadlines were open while the list directly beneath it
said there were none. Only one of the two reads rows through this model. A
disagreement between two numbers on one screen was the only symptom, and no
test noticed because every test builds its rows through the service, which
has always written both columns.
