"""Every connection the app opens must carry a bound on abandoned transactions.

A session that opens a transaction and then stops talking keeps every lock it
took until its connection closes. The fuse this tree already had is
``lock_timeout``, and it is on the wrong side of that: it makes each VICTIM of
an abandoned transaction give up faster while the culprit stays open and waits
for the next victim. ``idle_in_transaction_session_timeout`` is the one that
removes the culprit, and until now no application connection carried it - the
only place it existed was ``tests/conftest.py``, which sets it on the test
DATABASE and therefore says nothing about production.

These tests are built so that only the new mechanism can make them pass. The
test database already carries a 300s database-level default, so a connection
reporting "some non-zero value" would prove nothing. Every assertion here is
made against a budget no database default supplies, which can only have arrived
as the startup parameter the engine now sends.

There are two engines and therefore two halves: connections from
``create_engine_from_settings`` (2 seconds here), and the per-dispatch engine
background jobs build for themselves (7 seconds here), which cannot come through
that factory because it needs NullPool and carries a far larger budget.
