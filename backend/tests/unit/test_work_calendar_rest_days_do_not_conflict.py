"""The planning week may extend a country's week; it may never rest a working day.

Two structures in this product answer questions about a working week, and they
answer *different* questions:

* ``core.calendar._WORKING_WEEK`` is the country's week: the days a statute or a
  near-universal convention says are worked. Weekdays are Mon=0..Sun=6.
* ``schedule.service.WORK_CALENDARS``, reached through ``get_work_calendar``, is
  the week the planner schedules against. Same Mon=0 convention, but it carries
  ``hours_per_day``, ``work_days`` and ``label``, and it is the only one of the
  two that any date arithmetic reads.

**Which assertion this file makes, and which it deliberately does not.**

It asserts *no conflict*, not equality. A construction schedule is not a
statutory week, and the shipped table says so in its own comments: Brazil is
marked ``44h/week legal`` and China ``common in construction``, both of which
plan a six-day site week on top of a five-day statutory one. That is a
deliberate model, so the planning week is allowed to *add* days.

What it may never do is *remove* one. If the country works Sunday and the
planning week rests it, every date the product computes for that country lands
on the wrong side of the weekend, and it does so silently, because a duration
still comes back as a plausible number.

    allowed:   planning_week ⊇ country_week        (an extension, e.g. Brazil)
    forbidden: country_week - planning_week ≠ ∅    (a misplaced rest day)

Do not weaken this into ``planning_week == country_week``. Equality would fail
Brazil, China and India, whose extra Saturday is intended, and "fixing" them to
make it pass would delete a deliberate site-week model.

**Why the absence case is tested separately.** A country missing from the
resolver does not raise; it falls through to ``DEFAULT``, a Monday-Friday week.
So a Gulf state that is simply absent gets exactly the same wrong weekend as one
that is mapped to the wrong calendar, with nothing to distinguish it from a
country that legitimately has no special calendar.

    The bar here is a planning week that is *not* Monday-Friday, not merely a
    non-default calendar, because a misplaced rest day is what this file exists
    to catch. Spain and France are routed to their own calendars and are absent
    from ``_WORKING_WEEK``; both plan Monday-Friday, so neither can carry the
    weekend on the wrong days, and France's separate entry exists to hold seven
    hours a day rather than a different set of days.

    Adding those two to ``_WORKING_WEEK`` is deliberately not done here.
    ``_WORKING_WEEK`` and ``_HOLIDAY_FUNCS`` have to move together, because a
    working week with no holiday function behind it is the defect that made
    ``_get_holidays`` return an empty set for Bahrain and Oman, counting every
    non-weekend day as a working day. Closing this gap properly means sourcing
    Spanish and French public holidays, which is its own change.
