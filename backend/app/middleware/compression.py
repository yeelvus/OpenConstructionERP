"""Compress the responses that compress, and leave the rest alone.

Measured on the local stand: every screen loads a 2.44 MB application bundle and
a 2.21 MB locale chunk before it draws anything, and both went over the wire
uncompressed even though the browser asked for gzip on every request. The two
slow screens in the case audits, the snag register at 4.3 s and the bill editor
at 4.1 s, share that cost and differ only by their own chunk, which is 65 KB and
59 KB. The API was never the problem: the endpoints those screens call answer in
under a tenth of a second.

Starlette ships ``GZipMiddleware`` and it would do most of this, but it
compresses by content length alone. That means it also spends CPU on PDF
exports, GAEB archives and photo bytes, which are already compressed and come
out slightly larger, and it buffers streaming responses to do it. On a 2 GB VPS
that is the wrong trade, so this one asks what the body is before it spends
anything: text compresses, everything else is passed through untouched.

A response that already carries ``Content-Encoding`` is left as it is, so a
pre-compressed asset served straight from disk is never compressed twice.
