"""Re-indexing a BOQ position after an edit must not stall the event loop.

Every ``boq.position.updated`` event re-indexes the position through
``app.core.vector_index.index_one``. That used to clip the text on the event
loop, which asks for the embedder and so waits on the model-load lock for as
long as another thread holds it (a 3 s hold measured as a 2.98 s loop freeze),
and then ran the synchronous LanceDB delete and add on the loop too. All of it
was wasted on a price edit: neither the embedded text nor the stored payload
carries a price.

These tests use the real BOQ position adapter and a fake in-memory store. They
pin two things. First, the embedder, the store lookup, the write and the delete
all run in worker threads, checked by thread identity rather than timing, and
with an embedder that only returns once the loop itself releases it. Second, a
price edit embeds and writes nothing, while a change to anything the store
holds (text or payload) still indexes, and so does a store that cannot answer.
