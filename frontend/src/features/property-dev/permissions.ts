// Role sets mirroring the property_dev permission registry. These decide
// whether a control is worth putting on screen. They are not the wall: the
// backend re-checks every request and owns the answer. What they buy is that
// the UI neither offers a control the server would refuse, nor hides one the
// server would now serve.
//
// Each constant is named after the PERMISSION it mirrors rather than after
// the roles it happens to contain, because the roles are a derived set. A
// permission at EDITOR level also admits MANAGER and ADMIN through the rank
// hierarchy, plus every legacy alias that resolves into one of those, so the
// list here is longer than the mapping on the backend and will change
// whenever an alias is added. Naming the permission keeps the call sites
// honest about what they are gating and lets a later change swap the array
// for a real permission lookup without touching them.
//
// Kept equal to the backend by scripts/check_role_mirrors_match_the_backend.py,
// which resolves the closure through the same registry the request path uses
// and asserts set equality in both directions.
