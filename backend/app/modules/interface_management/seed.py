# DDC-CWICR-OE: DataDrivenConstruction - OpenConstructionERP
"""Interface-register demo seed - a populated coordination register per project.

Opens the Interfaces page on a register a coordinator would recognise: a
couple of dozen handshakes between two work packages, each owned by one party
and accepted by another, running from ``identified`` through ``agreed`` to
``closed``, with a few overdue and one or two in dispute, and the actions that
have to happen before each one can be signed off.

Nothing here invents an organisation. Both sides of every interface are drawn
from the subcontractors the demo already carries (falling back to the contact
book), the work-package names come from those firms' own trade categories, and
the ``owner_subcontractor_id`` soft link points at the very row whose name is
printed - so the text and the link always tell the same story even after the
firm names are rewritten.

The register is internally consistent, because the module's whole point is the
numbers derived from it (:mod:`app.modules.interface_management.register`
computes overdue, agreed percent and per-package health from these rows):

* ``agreed`` carries an agreed date and no closing date;
* ``closed`` carries both, in that order, and has no open actions left;
* ``identified`` / ``open`` / ``in_progress`` / ``disputed`` / ``on_hold``
  carry neither;
* a handful are deliberately past their need-by date and unsettled, so the
  overdue tile is not a zero and the work-package health view has something to
  report.

Dates are anchored to the run date, never hardcoded, so a demo opened a year
from now still shows a register with live deadlines.

Idempotent per project: a project that already carries an interface is left
untouched, so a re-run never doubles the register.
