"""Every demo project is offered a BIM model.

``install_demo_project`` only attaches CAD/BIM assets when
``bundle_key_for(demo_id)`` returns a bundle. A demo template that is missing
from ``BUNDLE_MAP`` is never even offered to ``attach_demo_assets``, so it ends
up with no ``BIMModel`` row at all.

Nothing complains when that happens. A missing model is not an error anywhere;
it is an absence that other seeders read as "nothing to do":

    * ``app.modules.bcf.seed`` returns early on a project with no model and
      logs the skip at debug level, so the BCF issue register stays empty and
      the log says nothing at INFO.
    * ``app.modules.bim_hub.seed`` federates existing models only, so a project
      with none gets no federation either.

The result is a project that opens on an empty coordination surface with
nothing on screen to say the data is missing rather than the feature broken.

Seven templates had drifted out of the map this way - each pack landed after
``seed_demo_assets`` was written and nobody added the row. The count is not
what this test guards. It asserts the invariant instead: every template that
resolves is offered a bundle, so the next pack that lands unmapped goes red
here rather than shipping an empty register.

These assertions read module-level registries only and need no database.
