"""A missing diacritic must not decide which project type a request lands in.

The offline detector matches synonym substrings against the raw request, so
before accents were folded the answer depended on the writer's keyboard.
``Küchenumbau`` reached the kitchen and ``kuchenumbau`` reached nothing;
``пристройка`` reached the extension and ``пристроика`` reached nothing. Seven
of the twelve marked synonyms detected no type at all when typed flat, which
sends a request that named its own type onto the manual tiles.

The fold is not free, and here it is expensive in exactly one place: ``küche``
folds to ``kuche``, which sits inside ``Kuchen``. German for cake and German
for kitchen differ by the umlaut alone, so folding that one synonym reads a
bakery fit-out as a kitchen renovation. It stays literal, and the last test is
what keeps that exemption from outliving its reason.
