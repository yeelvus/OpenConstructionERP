        left out, of what each certified: its period gross less the retention
        it held. It used to be the prior claims' gross alone, which left their
        retention in line 7 and under-billed line 8 by it every month.

        Which earlier claims count is a decision, not an oversight: every
        application that was not rejected, submitted and approved ones
        included, rather than only those already certified or paid as the
        form's wording reads. A claim's net due is worked out when it is
        generated and is not worked out again at certification, and nothing
        stops the next claim being generated while this one is still with the
        owner. A line 7 of certified claims only would leave the pending
        claim's net inside the next claim's line 8, and once both are
        certified that work is paid twice. Counting it can only err the other
        way, when the pending claim is later rejected, and then the claim
        after picks the work up again: an underpayment for a month, never a
        double payment. Reading line 7 as certified claims only needs
        certification to refuse or re-work an overlapping claim first
        (test_overlapping_claims_never_pay_the_same_work_twice).

        A draft is not an application: it has not left the contractor, so a
        certificate built now leaves it out. A claim issued before that rule
        keeps counting the drafts it counted; see
        :meth:`ProgressClaimRepository.prior_claims`.

        Returns the amount and the basis it was worked out on. ``"snapshot"``
        when the previous claim stores its certificate: line 7 is then its
        line 6, lines 4 less 5 as it certified them, which is what the form
        asks for. ``"reconstructed"`` for a previous claim from before the
        snapshot: the figure is rebuilt from each prior claim's stored gross
        and retention plus the releases billed on it, which is exact for
        claims generated since the claim basis fix and carries the old double
        count for claims generated before it.

        The snapshot is also refused, in favour of reconstruction, when some
        earlier claim billed gross that no line of its own accounts for. The
        two are not the same quantity. A snapshot is one claim's cumulative
        to date, which is assembled from schedule lines, so a month carried
        by no line is missing from it permanently. Reconstruction sums each
        claim's own gross, so that month is counted once, on the claim that
        billed it. The snapshot is not a cheaper reconstruction, it is a
        lossier one that happens to agree whenever every month has lines,
        which is why it survived: that is the whole population anyone had.

        Both read values that are frozen when a claim is certified. Every
        writer of ``gross_amount`` and ``retention_amount`` requires the
        claim to be a draft, a release can only be billed onto a draft claim
        and cannot be voided off a locked one, and ``certified`` leads only
        to ``paid``. So reconstruction is no more exposed to a later edit
        than the snapshot is; it is simply the more complete of the two.

        The G703 continuation sheet is assembled per schedule line, and so is
        every cumulative figure frozen on a claim. Money billed with no line
        behind it is therefore invisible to both, while remaining fully
        visible to what the claim certified. This is that money, and it is
        the one definition of it: the sheet puts it on a row of its own and
        :meth:`previous_certificates` refuses the snapshot on the strength of
        it, so the quantity and the condition that depends on it cannot drift
        apart into two answers.

        Two different things arrive in this figure and it is deliberately
        blind to which. A claim may have had no lines at all, billed from
        cost. Or its gross outran the schedule it was apportioned across and
        the remainder was left unplaced. Both are gross that no line carries.

        Floored per claim rather than on the total. The two forms differ only
        when some claim's gross is below its own lines, and which of them
        depends on that never happening is the point: this one is correct
        whether or not the list of writers is complete, the aggregate form is
        correct only if it is. They agree on every shape measured today,
        because a recompute on each line write holds gross equal to the sum
        of the lines, and that recompute is being removed so a claim billed
        from cost keeps its basis when somebody adds a line by hand.

        Memoised on the service, which lives for one request, keyed on
        ``(contract_id, before_claim_id)``. That key is the whole input: the
        residual is a function of the prior claims of one claim on one
        contract, and ``prior_claims`` is only ever those same claims handed
        in to save resolving them twice.

        The memo cannot go stale inside a request, and it is worth saying why
        because the code shows only that it is fast. What it reads is the
        stored gross of claims BEFORE this one, and every writer of that
        column refuses a claim that is not a draft, while nothing that writes
        it goes on to draw a certificate in the same request. The certificate
        path itself only reads. Certification does write, but it writes the
        claim being certified, which by construction is not among the claims
        this is measuring. So no request both populates this and then changes
        what it answers.

        The packs declare a retention policy per country and the engine applies
        one only from a :class:`RetentionSchedule` row, which nothing ever
        wrote. So a United States contract retained its opening rate to the end
        of the job while the pack said the rate halves at half complete: the
        rule was declared and never applied. This writes it onto the contract
        at the moment it is signed, for the same reason
        ``original_contract_value`` is frozen there. A later correction to a
        pack, or a change to the project's country, then cannot rewrite what an
        already signed contract withholds.

        Nothing is written unless the pack's opening rate is the rate the
        parties agreed. Equality, not a bound: a ladder opening below the
        agreed rate releases money early, one opening above it withholds more
        than was agreed, and those are as wrong as each other. Where they
        agree, the parties took the country's standard opening rate and the
        country's standard step-down goes with it, which from there can only
        reduce what is held.

        ``release_rule`` is left empty deliberately. Releases already resolve
        through the pack on every read, and a release rule frozen here would
        outlive a correction to the documents an event requires, which is the
