"""Pin which test trees the workflow files say they run.

A test that no lane names does not fail. It reports nothing at all, and an
absent signal is indistinguishable from a green one when you are reading a
list of check marks. Several trees under ``backend/tests`` are in exactly
that position: they are reached only by the bare ``pytest`` in the nightly
full suite, so a break in them is invisible on the commit that caused it.

This does not argue that every tree belongs in the push lane. Some of them
genuinely should not be there, because the push lane has a time budget. What
it argues is that the split should be a decision somebody wrote down, not an
accident of which paths happened to get typed into a workflow file. So the
map below is pinned. Moving a tree between classes is allowed and is
sometimes the right change, but it has to be an edit to this file, which
means it shows up in review instead of drifting.

The workflow files are read as text. Asking GitHub what it ran would be a
better source and is not available from a test, so the honest limit of this
guard is that it checks the configuration and not the runner.

The larger limit is below, in ``REQUIRED_STATUS_CHECKS``. Nothing any of these
classifications describes stops a push to main today, and this file cannot see
that for itself: branch protection lives in the repository settings and leaves
no artefact in the tree, so turning required checks on or off changes nothing
here and no test can go red on it. What is recorded instead is the measurement,
with its date, so that a reader is told rather than left to infer, and so that
whoever writes the change down is sent back to re-read the map.

Every class below is named for the question it answers, which is what the
workflow files declare. That is deliberate and it is the second thing this file
learned about itself: the paragraph above used to explain at length that a
class called ``PUSH_FULL`` did not mean anybody acts on a break, and a reader
of this repository was misled by the label anyway, having never opened the
header. A caveat in a docstring loses to a label in the output, because the
label is what gets quoted.

# DECLARED_NAMED_FILES sits below DECLARED_FILTERED rather than beside it, and the
# reason is what happens to a file added tomorrow. A -k or -m runs against the
# tree as it stands at the time, so a new test file is at least a candidate
# for the filter. A step that lists its files by name cannot pick one up at all
# until somebody edits the workflow, which makes it the weaker promise about
# a tree even when it happens to name a lot of files today.

# What the workflow files declare about each tree today. Read this as the
# current contract, not as an endorsement of it: DECLARED_FILTERED in particular
# means the tree is named but that a -k or -m narrows it to a small slice, which
# is much closer to DECLARED_ON_DEMAND than the workflow file makes it look.
#
# tests/unit reads DECLARED_FULL because ci.yml runs the tree whole and declares
# no continue-on-error. That is a statement about the file and nothing else.
#
# What used to follow that sentence has been remeasured and was wrong. It said
# the job had been red for a long time for an unrelated reason and was treated
# as advisory, and it offered that as the reason the PostgreSQL lane names unit
# files one at a time. Remeasured 2026-08-29: the unrelated reason was the Node
# heap ceiling on the frontend type check and build, fixed on 2026-06-05 and
# 2026-06-06 by d33d9bebf and 9b2007ba7. Both steps run at
# --max-old-space-size=9216 today (ci.yml:480, :488) and both are green, so a
# red Backend CI now is a real failure that has to be read rather than
# discounted. Leaving the old sentence in place would have handed the next
# reader a retired reason to go on ignoring the lane.
#
# A second cause of that silence was fixed on the day this was remeasured.
# ci.yml cancelled in progress unconditionally, and this repository pushes
# straight to main, so each push killed the run from the push before it: 28 of
# the last 30 runs on main were cancelled. The block now excludes main. A
# cancelled run reaches no conclusion, nothing goes red, and that silence had
# been standing in for a green.
#
# One reason survives both measurements: no status check is required on main,
# so a full declaration is still not a break anybody is forced to act on, and
# that alone is why the PostgreSQL lane keeps naming unit files one at a time.
# One reason where this comment claimed three, and the two it lost were both
# instruments that had stopped reporting rather than facts about the tests.
