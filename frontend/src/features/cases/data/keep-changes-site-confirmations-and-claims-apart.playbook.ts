// Case: "Keep changes, site confirmations and claims apart" (CN).
//
// Chinese site practice separates three instruments that a lot of contract
// administration elsewhere blurs into one word. An instructed change to the
// works is issued and priced. A site confirmation is a record of work or an
// event, signed on site on the day precisely so it can be priced later. A claim
// is a demand for time or money under the contract, and it lives or dies on
// notice and evidence rather than on agreement.
//
// They travel differently, they are signed by different people at different
// moments, and money is lost when one is filed as another - a site confirmation
// nobody signed on the day is worth nothing later, and a claim raised as a
// change order skips the notice the contract required. This case gives each one
// its own register and keeps the paper trail behind them separate. Content
// strings are key plus inline English default and live only here.

    "Three different pieces of paper cover the ground between what was contracted and what was built, and the commonest commercial loss on a site is filing one of them as another. An instructed change is authorised before the work and priced against the contract's rates. A site confirmation records that something happened - extra excavation in unexpected ground, a stoppage, plant standing - and is signed on the day by whoever was there, because its whole value is that a signature exists from before anyone knew what it would be worth. A claim asks for time or money the contract puts at the other party's risk, and the contract almost always attaches a time bar to it. This case walks the same event through the register it actually belongs in, and keeps the day's record underneath all three.",
