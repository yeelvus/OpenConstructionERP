"""Working-days calendar engine - Wave 28 of the worldwide-parameterisation audit.

Provides:
    is_working_day(date, country_code) -> bool
    next_working_day(date, country_code) -> date
    resolve_holidays(country_code, year) -> dict  (dates plus their provenance)

Per-country rules are defined inline (public holidays and working weeks) and
drawn from the regional-pack ``holidays`` config keys.

Easter computation uses ``dateutil.easter`` (already a project dependency).
Hijri (Islamic) holidays use the maintained ``hijridate`` library to convert
Eid al-Fitr (1 Shawwal) and Eid al-Adha (10 Dhu al-Hijjah) to Gregorian for
any requested year.  Japanese equinoxes use the standard integer
approximation valid for 1980-2099.  Hindu holidays (Diwali, Holi) have no
reliable lightweight panchang library, so they are served from a curated
multi-year lookup table; years outside the table skip those holidays rather
than crash.  Carnaval (Brazil) is derived from Easter.

    Returns the STATUTORY days only, which is 13 a year from 2025 and 11 before
    it. Read the limitation at the end of this docstring before using the result
    to derive a deadline, because it does not err in the direction the other
    stated limitations in this file do.

    New Year's Day, Labour Day and the three National Day days are fixed
    Gregorian. Spring Festival, Qingming, Dragon Boat and Mid-Autumn come from
    ``_CN_FESTIVALS``, which covers 2024-2030 only. A year outside that window
    logs a warning and returns just the fixed days, which is a deliberate and
    documented shape rather than a silent shortfall.

    Festivals can coincide with fixed days, so the set is sometimes smaller than
    the statutory count without anything being wrong: in 2028 Mid-Autumn falls on
    3 October, the third day of National Day, and China observes the two as one
    longer break.

    Known limitation, and it is the point of this docstring: China moves working
    days. The State Council publishes an arrangement each year that stretches
    these statutory days into longer breaks and pays for them by turning
    particular Saturdays and Sundays into working days. It is announced annually,
    it is not derivable, and it is not modelled here.

    That omission does **not** have a safe direction, and this is where China
    differs from the short Bahrain and Oman sets, which are conservative because
    they can only overcount working days. The arrangement is a swap rather than a
    grant, so it has two halves pulling opposite ways:

    * The borrowed days off are not modelled, so days that are actually holidays
      count as working. That overcounts working days and pulls a derived deadline
      EARLIER, which is the dangerous direction.
    * The bridging weekends are not modelled, so days that are actually working
      count as weekend. That undercounts and pushes a deadline LATER.

    Because the arrangement borrows roughly what it spends, the two approximately
    cancel over a full year. What is wrong is therefore less the total than which
    days carry it, and the sign of the error on any one span depends on where
    that span begins and ends relative to a festival. Do not assume this function
    is conservative.

    Six of the nine base dates in the Act's own Schedule are fixed or
    Easter-relative: New Year's Day, Good Friday, Easter Monday, Workers' Day
    (1 May), National Day (1 October) and Christmas Day. The remaining three -
    Eid al-Fitr, Eid al-Kabir (Eid al-Adha) and the Prophet's Birthday - are
    Minister-declared under the Act rather than fixed by statute, so this
    function converts them from the Islamic calendar the same way
    ``_gcc_eids`` does for the Gulf states. The Act leaves duration to that
    declaration entirely, and a single converted day is what this function
    asserts, which is a fact about the statute rather than a hedge: unlike
    ``_gcc_eids``, no multi-day span is applied here, because there is no
    sourced convention to apply one from.

    Two dates are current practice but are not in the base 1979 Schedule text
    this function's sourcing could retrieve directly. Both rest on
    corroboration from multiple independent secondary sources rather than on
    a primary instrument read in full:

    - Boxing Day, 26 December, observed alongside Christmas Day.
    - Democracy Day. Originally 29 May from 1999, moved to 12 June by
      presidential proclamation in 2018 to mark the anniversary of the
      annulled 12 June 1993 election, and understood to have been added to
      the Schedule by the Public Holidays (Amendment) Act 2019. That
      amendment's own text could not be retrieved for this function - its
      source no longer resolves - so 12 June rests on corroboration, not on
      the amending instrument having been read directly. A future reader with
      access to the 2019 amendment's text can close this gap.

    Section 5 of the Act is unusual among the countries in this file: a
    single holiday falling on a Saturday or Sunday gets no substitute day by
    default. Adjacent-pair rules exist in the Act for a Friday+Saturday,
    Saturday+Sunday or Sunday+Monday holiday combination, and ad hoc
    substitute days can be declared by the President or a state Governor
    under Section 2, but neither is computed here. Short is the direction
    that overcounts working days, which pulls a derived deadline earlier -
    the same direction of error ``_holidays_bh`` names for its own
    Minister-declared days.

    Children's Day, 27 May, is deliberately excluded. It is a holiday for
    primary and secondary school pupils, not a non-working day under the
    Public Holidays Act, and answers a different question than this function
    does.

                            provenance, never on this.
        ``year``            the year asked for.

        A caller wanting one verdict passes all three to

        Saudi Arabia answered fully covered on a span its own source says runs

        which is an answer. A country nothing covers is a ``FALLBACK`` to a week
        with no public holidays, which is a weaker answer. A failed computation
