# DDC-CWICR-OE: DataDrivenConstruction - OpenConstructionERP
"""A read-only demo refuses a WebSocket handshake it did not allowlist.

Separate from ``test_demo_read_only.py`` because it asserts a different thing.
That file proves the guarantee over the HTTP surface with a row census; this
one covers the half a census cannot see, where the refusal is a close code
rather than a status code and nothing is written either way.

Why the refusal exists at all. A socket carries no method, so layer 1 has
nothing to key a safe-versus-unsafe decision on, and before this it let every
handshake through and left sockets resting on the database tripwire alone. That
tripwire has one documented blind spot, the raw-cursor ``COPY`` in
``app.modules.costs.router``, and for an HTTP route layer 1 is what covers it.
Refusing an un-allowlisted handshake is the socket's layer 1, so a socket added
later is refused until somebody reads it and adds it deliberately.

Both polarities, on one application, because either half alone proves nothing:
an allowlisted socket must still open with the flag ON, or the guard has simply
broken the demo's realtime features, and an un-allowlisted one must be refused
with the flag ON and open with it OFF, or the refusal is not the guard.

    nothing is not an entry that does nothing: the route it named goes back to
    being refused on the demo, and only on the demo.

    This is the one test in this file that is not about sockets, and that is
    deliberate. ``ALLOWED_ENDPOINTS`` is built from three lists, this check
    used to read one of them, and a check whose population is a third of the

    The HTTP entries fail differently from the socket ones and both directions
    are bad. A stale socket entry is silent - a refused handshake reaches the
    browser as a close code our own clients do not render. A stale HTTP entry
    does produce a 403 with a body, but nothing in CI ever asks for those paths
