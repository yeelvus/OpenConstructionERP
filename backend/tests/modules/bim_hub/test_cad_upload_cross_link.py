"""A failed documents cross-link must not lose the uploaded CAD model.

READ THIS BEFORE WRITING ANY TRANSACTION-ISOLATION TEST IN THIS CODEBASE.

A mocked ``flush`` that merely raises does not set the session's rollback-only
flag. Only a real database failure does. So a test that patches ``flush`` to
raise, and then asserts the request still finishes, passes identically with and
without the SAVEPOINT it claims to guard - before the fix and after it. It is
not a weak test, it is a test of nothing, and it looks exactly like a strong one
because the code under test really does contain the isolation it is asserting.
The trap is not that mocks are imprecise. It is that this particular flag lives
in SQLAlchemy's session state and is set by the failure path a mock replaces.

The consequence is general. Any test here that asks "does the rest of the
request survive a failed write" has to make the write fail the way the database
fails, and the only proof that it does is running it against the code from
before the fix and watching it go red. If you have only ever seen it pass, you
do not yet know what it tests.

``POST /upload-cad/`` saves the model row, streams the file into storage, and
then writes a ``Document`` row so the file also appears in the documents hub.
That last step is convenience work. The model is already saved by the time it
runs, and the comment above it has always said a failure there is non-fatal.

Saying so takes more than an ``except``. A failed ``flush()`` marks the whole
session for rollback, and on PostgreSQL the transaction goes to aborted
server-side at the same moment. The endpoint then reaches
``await service.session.commit()`` twenty lines further down - the commit that
makes the model durable before the background converter goes looking for it -
and that raises ``PendingRollbackError`` instead. The upload dies describing a
transaction problem rather than a cross-link problem, the user gets a 500, and
the model they just uploaded is gone even though it was written and stored
successfully. This product has paid for that class of bug before, most visibly
when deadline notifications went dark because one bad row poisoned a session
that a caught exception could not revive.

The endpoint therefore runs the cross-link inside ``session.begin_nested()``,
and these tests are about that SAVEPOINT rather than about the ``except``. "No
exception escaped" cannot tell the two apart. What separates them is whether the
request can still finish, so that is what is asserted.

Remove the ``async with service.session.begin_nested():`` line from
``upload_cad_file`` and ``test_a_failed_cross_link_still_returns_the_model``
fails with ``PendingRollbackError`` raised from the endpoint's own commit.

The failure is injected by pointing the cross-link row at a project that does
not exist. ``Document.project_id`` carries a foreign key, so the flush fails the
way a database really fails, with an ``IntegrityError`` raised by PostgreSQL and
the transaction aborted server-side too. Nothing else about the upload changes;
the model row still names the real project.

The endpoint is called directly rather than over HTTP. It is an ordinary async
function whose auth and permission arguments are ``Depends`` defaults, so a
direct call exercises every line of the upload body - the access check, the
magic-byte gate, the storage write, the cross-link and the commit - without
standing up a client and a login for a code path no other test reaches.
``BackgroundTasks`` collects the conversion task and never runs it, which is
what we want: the DDC conversion is not what is under test here.
