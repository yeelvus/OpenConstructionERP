// Turns the three things the backend already publishes about cost bases into
// one row per base that a person can actually choose from.
//
// The three sources, and why each is the one used:
//   * GET /v1/costs/regions/      - the authoritative list of base ids. This is
//     the ONLY list whose values the search endpoints accept as `region`, and
//     it is the only one that filters out the `__xlate_` staging regions an
//     interrupted language swap leaves behind. Never substitute the stats list
//     for it: stats does not filter those, so a staging region would appear in
//     the picker as if it were a base.
//   * GET /v1/costs/base-catalog/ - the registry (backend base_registry.py) that
//     knows a base's market, city, currency, flag and norm system. Decoration
//     only; it enumerates what is LOADABLE, not what is loaded.
//   * GET /v1/costs/regions/stats/ - the live per-region row count, which is the
//     one honest measure of a base's size on THIS install.
//
// A region the registry has never heard of (a customer's own import, or a
// legacy tag such as DE_HAMBURG that predates the registry) still gets a row
// with its real size and a readable name derived from its id. It is marked
// `known: false` so the UI can say "imported base" instead of inventing a
// currency for it.

 * A national base can carry several market cards that share one `base_region`
 * (China repriced into London, say). Only the card whose own `region` IS its
 * `base_region` names a base id that can appear in `oe_costs_item.region`, so
 * that card wins. The looser match is kept as a fallback so a registry shape
 * change degrades into a slightly less precise label rather than into nothing.
