"""Construction-control demo seed - a populated control register per demo project.

Construction control shipped routed, permissioned and empty, so all five of its
sections - acceptance inspections, materials and lab tests, as-built records,
hold and witness gates, handover packages - opened on the same empty card on
every demo project. This fills them with the register a quality engineer keeps.

The register is generated work package by work package rather than table by
table, and that is what makes it hold together. Each work package - a pile cap
pour, a weld run, a curtain-wall bay, a riser - contributes its own acceptance
criterion with real bounds from a real standard, the inspection judged against
that criterion, the material passport for what went into it, the lab test on the
sample taken from it, the survey that recorded where it ended up, and the gate
that had to be released before the next trade could follow. Cross-references
then hold because they were never assembled after the fact.

What a reader sees on the screen afterwards:

* an inspection register spread across scheduled, in progress, passed, failed
  and closed, where a failed inspection carries the non-conformance it raised
  and a re-inspection already booked behind it;
* material passports with EN 10204 certificate grades, heat and batch numbers
  and certificate validity - most accepted, some still under review, and one
  whose certificate has lapsed;
* lab results whose measured value genuinely satisfies the criterion they
  passed and genuinely breaches the one they failed. This is the arithmetic a
  reader can check from a screenshot, so it is decided by
  :func:`compute_tolerance_result` - the module's own judge - rather than
  written by hand;
* hold and witness gates where a released gate was released by a party
  authorised to release it, against an inspection that actually passed. A hold
  gate is never waived, because the module does not allow it;
* handover packages whose completion gate, open non-conformance count,
  unreleased hold count and completeness percentage are all produced by
  :meth:`HandoverService.assemble` from the evidence above, so the gate on the
  screen is the real gate and not a decoration.

Dates are anchored to the run date, never hardcoded.

Idempotent per project: a project that already carries an inspection is left
untouched, so a re-run never doubles the register.
