    The desktop shell spawns the Python backend as a bundled sidecar and sets
    ``OE_DESKTOP=1`` on its environment (see ``desktop/src-tauri/src/main.rs``).
    A PyInstaller/Nuitka frozen build also marks ``sys.frozen``. Either signal
    means the backend is the single-user local workspace behind the native
    shell rather than a shared, internet-exposed server.

    This is intentionally a plain function (not a cached ``Settings`` field) so
    tests can flip ``OE_DESKTOP`` via ``monkeypatch`` between calls without
    busting the settings ``lru_cache``.

    Returns:
        ``True`` when ``sys.frozen`` is set, or when the ``OE_DESKTOP``
        environment variable is ``"1"`` or ``"true"`` (case-insensitive).
