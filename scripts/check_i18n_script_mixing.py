"""i18n script guard: block a locale value written in someone else's alphabet.

Found 10.08.2026 on the live site. `th/cases/build-an-all-in-labour-rate`
served the Korean title 종합 노무 단가 산정 under Thai chrome, because 42 of
the 197 `cases.*` slugs in `th.ts` hold Korean values - 1031 keys copied
whole out of `ko.ts`. Nine other locales carry the smaller shape of the
same defect: one wrong-language word inside an otherwise correct sentence,
`Режим на群добавяне` in Bulgarian, `キャッシュフロー데이터` in Japanese,
`Жалпы בפועל` in Kyrgyz, `Onge番号` in Dutch, `Включения` in Polish.

Nothing we own could see it. The orphan guard asks whether a key is
reachable and these are. The plural guard asks whether a counted key has
its forms and these do. `tsc` and the build never read locale content.
Byte-comparison against English passes trivially, because Korean is not
English either. The string is present, well-formed, correctly escaped, and
in the wrong language, and only a human who reads Thai would notice.

So this guard asks the one question the others cannot: is the value
written in a script this language actually uses.

Three things worth knowing about how it counts.

  * Latin is allowed everywhere and is never flagged. Product names, units,
    file extensions and standard codes (`.xlsx`, `C30/37`, `DIN 276`, `BIM`)
    are Latin in every locale we ship. The consequence is that this guard
    cannot see French sitting in `de.ts` - both are Latin - and it is not
    trying to. It catches alphabet mismatches, not translation quality.

  * Some foreign script is in the source string itself, not in the
    translation. `dwg_compare.col_delta` is the character Δ in all 37
    locales; `match_elements.new_excel.hint` deliberately lists the column
    name in several languages so a user can recognise theirs. Flagging
    those would mean 8787 findings, and a guard that reports 8787 things
    gets switched off. So a (key, script) pair carried by SHARED_AT_LEAST
    locales is treated as coming from the source string. That is a real
    hole: the same bad value pasted into enough locales would hide inside
    it. It is the price of the guard existing at all, and the threshold is
    deliberately far above the 1-to-7 locales every genuine finding hit.

  * Two characters live in one script's Unicode block and are ordinary
    punctuation in another's writing, so they are excluded outright rather
    than counted. The danda U+0964 sits in the Devanagari block and ends a
    Bengali sentence too - counting it reported 7282 phantom findings in
    `bn.ts`, more than the real Thai defect, from a locale that is entirely
    correct. The katakana middle dot U+30FB separates items in Korean and
    Chinese as well as Japanese.

Adding a locale means adding its row to SCRIPTS below. An unknown locale
file is an error rather than a pass, because silence about a language
nobody checked is what let this defect live.

Known debt lives in scripts/i18n_script_baseline.json and may only shrink.
