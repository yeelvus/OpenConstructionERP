"""OOM hardening for the documents photo upload path.

A raster photo's PIXEL count, not its byte size, is what OOMs the decoder: a
few-MB file can declare ~150 MP and expand to hundreds of MB of RGB on decode,
OOM-killing the single-worker container on the 3 GB target box (and blocking
the event loop while it does). These tests pin the guard added to
``documents.service``:

* an over-cap image is rejected with a clean 413 - never a 500 or a process
  death - both via the explicit dimension check (1x-2x the cap) and via
  Pillow's own DecompressionBomb guard (> 2x the cap);
* a header we cannot parse is NOT fatal (the magic-byte gate already vouched
  for the bytes; the thumbnail stays best-effort);
* a normal image passes the check and still thumbnails within the size cap;
* the thumbnail runs off the event loop (``asyncio.to_thread``) and the
  offloaded call writes byte-identical output to a direct call;
* even if the upfront gate were bypassed, the thumbnail path degrades to a
  clean ``False`` on an over-cap image instead of OOMing.

Pure unit tests: no DB, no app boot. The oversized case is simulated by
shrinking ``MAX_PHOTO_PIXELS`` rather than allocating a real 64 MP buffer.
