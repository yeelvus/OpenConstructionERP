"""An unauthenticated probe must not be handed the database's own words.

``/api/health`` reports whether the boot-time schema heal failed, and it briefly
also reported *why*, as ``f"{type(exc).__name__}: {exc}"``. What fails there is a
database exception, and SQLAlchemy DBAPI errors stringify with the statement
appended to them - ``[SQL: ALTER TABLE oe_... ADD COLUMN ...]``, very often
``[parameters: ...]`` as well.

Nothing authenticates that endpoint, on purpose. The desktop shell polls it with
no Authorization header to decide whether it may attach to a backend that is
already running rather than start a second one against the same data directory,
and container healthchecks ask on the same terms. So it answers anybody who can
reach the port, and on a deployment whose port is reachable the message would
hand an anonymous caller table names, column names and the text of the statement
that just failed on them.

The boolean beside it is the part an operator acts on, and the cause is written
in full to the boot log where the operator of that machine is. So the boolean is
published and the message is not. Both halves are held here: the text must not
appear anywhere in the response body, and the failure must still be reported,
because a fix that simply stopped saying anything would pass the first half and
lose the signal that made the field worth having.
