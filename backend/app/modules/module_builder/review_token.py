"""Proof that the spec being installed is the spec a person actually reviewed.

Installing a module writes Python to disk and loads it into the running server.
The platform's answer to that is a human review step: the wizard renders every
file through ``/preview`` and a person reads them before pressing install. That
step is only worth anything if the server can tell a reviewed spec from an
unreviewed one, and it could not: ``/preview`` and the install endpoint took the
same request body, so an install carried no evidence that a preview had ever
happened. The review was enforced by the screen, not by the API.

A digest computed over the spec by the caller would not fix that, because any
caller can compute one without ever asking for a preview. Only something the
server issued proves the server was asked. So ``/preview`` returns a short-lived
token, and install refuses a spec that does not arrive with a matching one.

The token binds three things, and each one closes a different hole:

* the spec digest, so the files that were rendered for review are the files that
  get written, and not a spec edited after the reading;
* the user, so one person's preview cannot authorise another person's install;
* the issue time, so a token cannot be kept and replayed indefinitely.

Within that window a token is not spent by using it, and saying so is part of
the claim: spending one would need a record of the tokens already seen, which is
exactly the state this refuses to keep. Reuse buys very little, because a spec
that is already installed is refused as a conflict, so what it leaves open is a
reinstall of the same reviewed files after an uninstall, inside the hour, by the
person who read them.

It is a signed statement, not a secret, and it deliberately stores no state: a
review token needs no table, no migration and no cleanup job, which keeps the
single-database promise intact. The signature uses the deployment's JWT secret,
which is already refused at startup in staging and production when left at its
development default.
