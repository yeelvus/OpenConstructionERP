"""The demo estate must speak the safety module's own vocabulary.

Same failure as the variations module, in two places at once. The seeder inserts
through the ORM, so nothing it writes ever passes the Pydantic layer that owns
the vocabulary, and the columns are plain ``String`` with no enum behind them.
What was seeded, measured 07.08:

* ``incident_type`` held ``first_aid`` and ``recordable``. ``IncidentCreate``
  accepts injury, near_miss, property_damage, environmental, fire. ``first_aid``
  is a *treatment* type and sat on rows that already carried
  ``treatment_type: first_aid``; ``recordable`` is the OSHA recordability
  concept, which has its own ``osha_recordable`` flag.
* ``severity`` held ``serious``, which is not on the module's minor / moderate /
  major / severe / critical scale.
* ``observation_type`` held ``unsafe_behavior``, ``housekeeping``,
  ``environmental`` and ``noise``. The module accepts four values and the type
  picker in the UI offers exactly those four, so a reader who opened one of
  those rows could not re-select the value the row already held.
* ``status`` on 14 of 17 observations was ``resolved``, which the module does not
  accept either. ``resolved`` is a real state in the punchlist state machine,
  which is presumably where it was borrowed from.

The second defect is not vocabulary but content: every incident and every
observation was seeded terminal, so the Open Incidents tile read zero on every
demo project and the register showed a reader nothing to act on.

The hand-written blocks are local variables inside ``_seed_module_data`` and
cannot be imported, so they are read out of the source with ``ast``. That is
weaker than calling the code, and it is why the generated half below is checked
by constructing the real schema objects rather than by matching strings.
