"""Generic activity-log table and write-through helper.

This is the FSM-aware companion to :mod:`app.core.audit`. While ``audit``
records arbitrary CRUD actions on any entity, ``audit_log`` is structured
specifically around status transitions: every row stores
``(from_status, to_status, action, reason, metadata)`` so dispute
timelines (FIDIC contract records, ISO 9001 traceability, SCL Protocol
contemporary records) can be reproduced byte-for-byte.

Table: ``oe_activity_log``

The existing ``oe_core_audit_log`` table is kept for backwards
compatibility - module services that already use it continue to work,
but new FSM-driven transitions write here as well so the lifecycle of
each entity can be inspected in one place.

Epic H - Universal Audit Trail (2026-05-26)
-------------------------------------------

The row layout is extended with 8 capture-context columns
(``ip_address`` / ``user_agent`` / ``request_id`` / ``module`` /
``parent_entity_*`` / ``before_state`` / ``after_state``). The capture is
driven by a single :class:`AuditContext` ContextVar that
:class:`app.middleware.actor_context.ActorContextMiddleware` sets at the
top of each HTTP request - service-layer callers do not need to thread
the IP / UA / request-id manually. When ``log_activity`` is called
outside an HTTP request (Celery worker, CLI seed) the ContextVar reads
``None`` and the columns stay NULL, which is the documented contract.

Usage::

    from app.core.audit_log import log_activity

    await log_activity(
        session,
        actor_id="user-uuid",
        entity_type="boq",
        entity_id="boq-uuid",
        action="status_changed",
        from_status="draft",
        to_status="final",
        reason="Approved by PM",
        metadata={"approval_doc_id": "..."},
        module="boq",                       # NEW (recommended)
        before_state={"status": "draft"},    # NEW (recommended)
        after_state={"status": "final"},     # NEW (recommended)

    wants best-effort audit (e.g. from inside a guard), wrap this in

    for a webhook handler).

    Args:
        session: Active async session bound to the same transaction as
            the business write.
        actor_id: UUID of the user. ``None`` for background / system

            ``rfq`` / ``submittal`` / …
        entity_id: UUID of the affected entity (string or UUID). NULL OK.
        action: Verb describing the event. Use ``status_changed`` for FSM
            transitions and ``created`` / ``updated`` / ``deleted`` for
            ordinary CRUD events.
        from_status: Previous status, or None for new-row events.
        to_status: New status, or None for delete events.
        reason: User-supplied free-form note.
        metadata: Arbitrary JSON payload merged into the row.
        tenant_id: Optional tenant scope (used in multi-tenant deploys).
        module: Logical module ("rfi" / "submittals" / …). Optional but
            strongly recommended - drives cross-module timeline
            filtering.
        parent_entity_type / parent_entity_id: Optional umbrella entity
            for rollup timelines (e.g. an RFI rolled into its project).
        before_state / after_state: Optional JSON snapshots of the
            affected record's prior / new column subset. Curated by the
            writer - do NOT dump full rows.
