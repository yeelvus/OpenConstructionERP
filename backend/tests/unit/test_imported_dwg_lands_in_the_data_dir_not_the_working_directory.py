"""One DWG root, and the project importer used to spell it a second way.

``dwg_takeoff`` writes and serves drawings under ``_dwg_data_base()``, which
defers to :func:`app.core.storage.resolve_data_dir`. Its docstring records why:
the body it replaced defaulted to ``<cwd>/data``, "never a member of
``safe_data_roots()`` and sensitive to the process CWD", which is what broke
drawings marked ready on standalone, Docker and macOS deployments.

Three declarations in :mod:`app.modules.projects` still carried that replaced
body - ``DATA_DIR`` or ``<cwd>/data``. Two are in ``bundle_import``: the
directory an imported drawing is extracted to, and the ``file_path`` written
into the database for it. The third is the root ``file_manager_service``
reports to a user asking where their files are. So a bundle import put the
drawing somewhere the module that serves it does not look, recorded that
location permanently, and then confirmed it.

Both assertions below run from a working directory that is NOT the repository
root, and the important ones run from two different ones: a single foreign
directory cannot distinguish an anchored path from a differently broken one.
