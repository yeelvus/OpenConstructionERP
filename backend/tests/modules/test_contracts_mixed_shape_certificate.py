"""A flat-retention certificate asks for what the claim bills, whatever shape the months are.

Cost-plus and time-and-materials contracts keep a flat retention rate, and
that branch works the claim's net out from its own gross. The certificate
drawn over the same claim works line 8 out from the columns. The two agree
only while every claim on the contract has the same shape, and a cost-plus
job has two shapes available at once: a claim generated from the period's
costs writes no claim lines, and a claim filled in from the line table or
from site progress writes one per schedule-of-values line.

Mix them and the certificate stops matching the claim, because column D is
assembled per line from what earlier claims billed while line 7 is what the
earlier claim actually certified. A month that billed with no lines is
invisible to column D and fully visible to line 7, so line 8 subtracts a
certificate that was never added.

The first two cases here are fixed and now pass. The sheet carries a row for
what earlier claims billed that no schedule line carries, and that row stays
out of the retention snapshot, which reconciles to a line 5 measured on the
schedule alone. Both halves were needed: line 8 is floored at zero, so the
certificate could only ever report this as nothing due however large it was,
and column D on its own moved these cases from underpaying to overpaying by
the retention held on the lineless month.

The same divergence has a second entrance, which nothing can reach today: a
stored material value counts in line 4 and does not count in the claim's
gross. No request schema accepts the field, so the tests that use it write
it through the repository, which is what the next person to wire up the
StoredMaterial tables will effectively be doing.

Read the controls with the failures. The two passing cost-plus cases say the
flat branch is right on a uniform contract, and the passing lump-sum case is
here to localize the fault: the same stored value on the retention engine's
path produces a certificate that does agree, so the defect is the flat
branch in ``roll_claim_retention`` and not the certificate builder. Without
that case a reader can conclude ``build_aia_application`` is broken in
general and go and change the wrong file.

One xfail mark is left, on the stored-material case, and it is strict, so
that fix cannot land without removing it.
