"""The embedder status card is told which case it is in, not asked to guess.

``/embedder/status/`` has always returned English prose telling the reader how
to install the optional semantic extra, and the frontend rendered that prose
verbatim. That is why the sentence was the one untranslated thing on an
otherwise fully translated panel: prose cannot be translated by the client, and
parsing it to recover the case would break on the first reword.

So the payload now names the case. The value exists to be looked up in a
translation table, which makes the relationship between it and the other two
fields load-bearing in a way a comment cannot enforce: a client that reads
``"pip"`` renders a copy box, and if ``pip_command`` were empty there it would
render an empty one. All three come off a single ``repair_hint`` call, so the
disagreement is structurally impossible today. This pins that, because the
obvious future edit is to compute the code from ``desktop_mode`` or from an
environment variable, either of which would answer a different question than
the one the command answers.

Both polarities are driven by setting ``sys.frozen``, which is the real switch
``is_frozen_build`` reads, rather than by stubbing our own function. A test that
replaces the branch it is checking proves only that the stub works.

#: Every code this endpoint is allowed to emit. The frontend treats the field as
#: an open set and falls back to the prose on anything it does not know, so a new

#: without a locale key behind it silently downgrades every language to English,
#: which is the exact defect this field was added to remove. Adding to this set
#: is the moment to notice that.
