// Case: "Set the project up on a JCT or NEC4 contract" (GB).
//
// The two British contract families behave differently enough that a team
// running one on the other's habits loses money quietly. This case records
// which form the job is actually under, what releases the retention, which
// statutory payment regime sits behind it, and which dates carry a
// consequence. Content strings are key plus inline English default and live
// only here.

    "Two contract families cover most British construction and they are not interchangeable. JCT is instruction and certificate led: the contract administrator issues an instruction, the work is valued under the valuation rules, delay runs through relevant events and an extension of time, and it ends on a final certificate. NEC4 is process led: early warnings, compensation events notified inside a time bar, quotations, and assessment against an accepted programme on a clock both parties are held to. What they share is the Construction Act sitting underneath both of them. This case records which form is in play so that everything downstream, valuations, variations, notices and the final account, is measured against the right paper rather than against the habits of the last job.",
