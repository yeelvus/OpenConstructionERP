"""Regression test for POST /api/v1/labor-rates/templates/ returning a 500.

A minimal, schema-valid create payload (just ``name`` and ``base_wage``) was
observed to 500 on a live instance after passing validation - the template
list stayed empty, so nothing was persisted. This exercises the real router
through the full ASGI app (not the service in isolation) against the
embedded PostgreSQL database, since the failure was reported against a real
request/response cycle.
