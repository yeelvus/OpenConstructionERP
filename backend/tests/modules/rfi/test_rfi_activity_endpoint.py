"""Focused tests for the RFI activity-journal endpoint (item #13).

``GET /{rfi_id}/activity/`` reuses the generic ``get_activity_for_entity``
helper over the shared ``oe_activity_log`` table to surface an RFI's
lifecycle history. These tests pin the two load-bearing pieces WITHOUT a
database, in the same monkeypatch / transient-ORM-object style as
``tests/integration/test_rfi_audit.py`` and
``tests/modules/file_approvals/test_notifications.py``:

#. ``test_get_rfi_activity_is_scoped_and_serialised`` - the route resolves
   the RFI, runs the project-scope (IDOR) guard against the RFI's OWN
   project, asks the helper for THIS RFI's journal (``entity_type="rfi"``,
   ``entity_id=<rfi_id>``), and serialises the rows through
   ``RFIActivityEntry`` (never the raw ORM row) inside a page envelope whose
   ``total`` is counted over the same two filters as the page.

#. ``test_rfi_activity_entry_maps_metadata_alias`` - the response schema maps
   the ``metadata_`` column to the wire field ``metadata`` (the subtle alias
   that a bare ``model_validate`` would otherwise drop).

The underlying DB query itself is already covered by
``tests/unit/test_audit_log.py``; here we only pin the wiring + contract.
