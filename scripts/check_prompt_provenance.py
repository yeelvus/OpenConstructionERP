"""Prompt provenance guard: keep the instruction text we send to a model readable.

Why this exists, which is not the same as what it checks.

An EU AI Act Article 5 measurement was run across the platform and came back
clean: nothing here infers emotion, categorises people biometrically, scores
social behaviour or scrapes faces. That result rests on a property of the code
rather than on anybody's judgement. Every instruction we send to a model is a
literal a reader can open and read, so "what do we ask the model to do" is a
question the source answers completely. Read the constants and you have read the
product.

That property is not a law of nature. The day a prompt is assembled from a
database row, a settings record, a request body or an uploaded file, the source
stops answering the question. A tenant could then ask for an affective label
through our own pipeline with no code change of ours, and a sweep like the one
that produced the clean result would see nothing, because there would be nothing
to see. The measurement would not be wrong so much as no longer meaningful.

So this guard holds the property open. If it goes red the honest response is to
redo the measurement, not to relax the guard.

The property is already not universal, and the acknowledgement lists below are
where that is written down rather than hidden. Somebody reading this file should
be able to answer "where can instruction text come from other than the source"
without having to read anything else.

What it checks
--------------

Every call to ``ai_client.call_ai`` passes its ``system`` argument. This walks
the AST to that argument and asks where the text came from, resolving a name one
hop through the enclosing function, one hop through a private helper's callers
in the same file, then to a module-level constant, then to a constant imported
from another module. Four outcomes:

``constant``
    A string literal, a concatenation, ``.format()`` over one, or an f-string
    every hole of which is itself constant. Interpolating data into a constant
    template is normal and necessary here, since a BOQ description has to reach
    the model somehow, but the hole is checked rather than assumed: a hole can
    hold another prompt, and then the hole is the instruction and the template
    says nothing about it. Two slots in this tree are raised by that rule and
    both are written down below.

``builder``
    The argument is a call to a helper that composes the text. The helper is not
    followed. Each one is listed in ``CLEARED_BY_READING`` with the constant a
    person arrived at, so a new helper fails until somebody opens it.

``runtime``
    The text comes from a row, a settings object, or a parameter whose origin
    this scan cannot see. Where the text really is runtime it goes in
    ``RUNTIME_BY_DESIGN`` with what writes it and who is allowed to write it.
    Where a person followed it to a constant it goes in ``CLEARED_BY_READING``.
    A new one fails either way.

``unresolved``
    The scan could not decide. This fails like a violation and says so, because
    a guard that reports nothing when it understood nothing is worse than no
    guard: it reads as a pass.

It also reads the text behind every slot it settled, and checks that text
against a closed list of affective vocabulary: emotion, sentiment, mood, morale,
attitude, temperament, trustworthiness, and the protected characteristics
alongside them. That is a tripwire, not a classifier. It cannot tell what a
prompt means. Its value is that a new shipped prompt containing one of those
words fails until somebody writes down why it is not what it looks like, which
is cheap to ask when the prompt is written and expensive to reconstruct later.
Measured the day it was written: 43 terms against 26 prompts, and the only term
present is "tone", twice, both times the phrase "no marketing tone" constraining
how the model writes its own summary.

What this file deliberately does not check is prompt text a customer wrote.
Custom agents store a system prompt per row and that is a feature, not an
oversight. A denylist over somebody else's instruction text would be trivial to
route around, and running one would imply a guarantee about their prompts that
we are in no position to give. Articles 25 and 26 put that consequence on the
deployer, which is where it belongs. We ship nothing affective; we ship the
ability to write it. Those are different products with different owners, and
the distinction is the answer rather than a gap in it.

It also checks the transcription path, which does not go through ``call_ai`` at
all. ``phonelog.transcription`` posts audio straight to a provider's REST audio
endpoint. That endpoint accepts an optional ``prompt`` field, so instruction text
could appear on the audio path without any ``call_ai`` site changing. The
multipart form is checked for it.

What it cannot see, stated plainly so nobody mistakes its silence for a proof.
It does not follow a builder into its body, it does not follow a public
function's parameter back to callers in other files, and it says nothing about
the ``prompt`` argument, which carries user data by design. Somebody who smuggles
instructions to the model inside a data field walks straight past this. It guards
the shape of the instruction slot, not the meaning of what arrives in it.

How to find a call site this file's anchors would miss, which is a real risk
because an anchor only ever finds the calls that go through it. The audio path
above was found by accident after a sweep organised by module name and module
docstring had already reported clean, and a module whose self-description
understates what it does defeats any sweep that reads prose. The search that
does not have that weakness is an intersection: take the modules that accept an
``UploadFile`` and intersect them with the modules that import ``ai_client``.
Neither half requires an opinion about what a module is for, and the result is
by construction every place a file a human uploaded meets a model. Run that
before trusting this file's list of anchors.

Exit codes: 0 clean, 1 findings, 2 the scan could not run and concluded nothing.
