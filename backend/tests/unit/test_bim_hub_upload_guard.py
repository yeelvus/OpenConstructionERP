"""Front-door OOM guards on the BIM Hub upload endpoint.

``upload_bim_data`` used to ``await file.read()`` both the element table and
the geometry blob with no size cap, and handed the xlsx straight to openpyxl
with no decompression-bomb guard - a single large drop could push the 3 GB
box into swap and OOM-kill the worker for everyone.

These tests call the router handler directly (no ASGI / DB): the project
access check and the service are stubbed, so they prove the guard behaviour
and the normal-upload happy path in isolation. They assert that:

    1. an oversized element table is rejected with 413 (streamed cap),
    2. an xlsx decompression bomb is rejected with 413 before openpyxl,
    3. an oversized geometry blob is rejected with 413 and no model is
       created (the guard fires before persistence),
    4. a normal CSV upload still converts to elements,
    5. geometry is persisted from the on-disk temp path (never a RAM blob),
    6. every extension the refusal message advertises can really be accepted.

Mirrors the direct-handler patch style of
``test_documents_revision_folder_write_gate.py``.
