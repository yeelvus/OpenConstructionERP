"""Pre-release security regression — Pipeline Builder auth gating.

The Pipeline Builder router is auto-mounted by the module loader, which
injects NO global auth dependency (auth in this codebase is per-route).
Phase 1 shipped several endpoints — including ``DELETE /{id}`` — taking
only a DB session, so they were reachable unauthenticated (data exposure
+ unauthenticated destructive delete / IDOR). Every read/mutate endpoint
now carries a ``CurrentUserId`` gate. These tests pin that: an anonymous
request must never reach pipeline data.

Test isolation (``feedback_test_isolation.md``): the per-session
PostgreSQL database is provided by ``backend/tests/conftest.py``; the
production database is never touched.

Run:
    cd backend
    python -m pytest tests/integration/test_pipelines_auth.py -v --tb=short
