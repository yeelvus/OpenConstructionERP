"""v3101_service_number_uniques — race-safe number allocation guard.

Round-5 service-module deep audit found that ``next_contract_number()``,
``next_ticket_number(contract_id)`` and ``next_work_order_number()`` each
read ``COUNT(*)`` then format-string concat the result into a label.
Under concurrent insert load (two dispatchers POSTing /tickets/ to the
same contract, or two recurring-schedule materialisers firing in parallel
on the same cron tick) the two requests race past the same COUNT and
produce identical labels. The service layer now retries on
IntegrityError; that retry is only effective if the DB actually has a
unique index to raise it.

Backfills three unique constraints:
  * ``oe_service_contract.contract_number``
  * ``oe_service_ticket (contract_id, ticket_number)`` (composite — ticket
    numbers reset per contract)
  * ``oe_service_work_order.work_order_number``

Uses ``op.create_index`` with ``unique=True`` so SQLite (no
``ALTER TABLE ADD CONSTRAINT``) succeeds.
