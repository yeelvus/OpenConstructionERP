"""Close a shipped tax window an install still holds open, and add what replaced it.

The defect
----------
``seed.py`` fills ``oe_i18n_tax_config`` only while the table is empty, so a
seed file that has since changed never reaches a database seeded before the
change. :mod:`app.modules.i18n_foundation.tax_seed_reconcile` covers half of
that: rate lines the file gained, which an old install does not hold at all.
The other half is a rate line the old install *does* hold, at a rate the file
has since superseded.

Nova Scotia is the live case. The province cut its harmonised rate from 15 % to
14 % on 2025-04-01, and ``tax_configurations.json`` carries both windows - the
15 % one closed at 2025-03-31, the 14 % one open. A database seeded before
v15.5.0 holds one Nova Scotia row, the 15 % one, still open. The reconciler
asks whether the jurisdiction holds anything in force, sees that it does, and
correctly declines: handing over the 14 % row without closing the 15 % one
leaves two rates replacing the federal one in the same province at the same
time, which is not a wrong number but a raised
:class:`~app.modules.i18n_foundation.tax_rules.TaxRuleError` - Nova Scotia
stops pricing at all. So the province keeps resolving at 15 % for the life of
the install, and ``/api/health`` reports a clean boot the whole time, because
nothing is missing and nothing is malformed.

Close and add, never rewrite
----------------------------
The shape is :mod:`app.modules.i18n_foundation.romania_vat`'s, and for its
reasons. The 15 % row is not edited to say 14 %. It is given the
``effective_to`` the shipped file gives it and the 14 % row is inserted beside
it, so an estimate or an invoice priced before the cut still resolves at 15 %
and re-running is a no-op, because a closed row no longer matches what this
looks for. That is what ``nature="superseded"`` declares and what
:func:`~app.core.data_repairs.verify_supersede_shape` holds the repair to.

General rather than one country, and why
----------------------------------------
Romania got a module of its own, and doing the same for Nova Scotia was the
obvious move. It was rejected on a measurement: **no gate fires when a window
is added to an existing rate line.** The reconciler's coverage test pins
``anchor_lines()``, which is a set of ``(country_code, tax_code)`` pairs, so
giving an existing line a second window leaves both the count and the digest
untouched. A rate change committed to the seed file today therefore reaches new
installs, silently skips every old one, and nothing anywhere says so - which is
this defect, repeating, with no test on the way.

So the population is derived from the shipped file rather than written out, and
``tests/unit/test_tax_window_supersede_population.py`` pins what the derivation
returns. The mechanism is general; the set of rate lines it will touch is not
allowed to grow without somebody saying so.

That set is two lines now, ``CA/HST_NS`` and ``IL/VAT``, and the second one is
what the generality was bought for. Israel raised standard VAT from 17 % to
18 % on 2025-01-01 and the seed file went on shipping 17 as the rate in force,
which is the same defect as Nova Scotia's in a second country. It was found by
reading, not by a red test, because no gate compared the seeded rate against
the methodology catalogue's own figure for the same country - the catalogue had
said 18 the whole time. ``tests/unit/test_tax_tables_do_not_drift.py`` compares
them now. Closing the Israeli window here needed no new code at all: the pair
went into the seed file and this repair picked it up, which is what "the
generality buys the next one" was a promise about.

Recognising our own row, and the limit of it
--------------------------------------------
A window is closed only when the row on file is the one the seeder wrote,
field for field on everything that carries a value:

* the same rate, to the character - a row that says 15.5 is not our 15.0;
* the same ``effective_from`` - a window somebody re-dated is theirs;
* still open, which is what makes the second pass a no-op;
* the same ``is_default`` flag as the shipped window;
* and a ``subdivision_code`` that is either the shipped one or empty.

Two of them are worth explaining, one because it narrows the repair further
than it looks and one because it deliberately does not.

``is_default`` is the narrow one. Requiring the flag to match is the tightest
contract the shape check accepts and keeps the repair from moving a flag it has
no business moving. The cost is that it declines any rate change whose two
shipped windows disagree about the flag, and a *national standard* rate change
is where that happens.

Romania is the proof, and it is on disk rather than hypothetical: the closed
19 % window ships ``is_default`` false and its 21 % successor ships it true,
because the flag names the country's current standard rate and moves with it.
An install seeded before that change holds the 19 % row still open and still
flagged, so the predicate compares true against false and declines. That is why
Romania has a repair of its own rather than a line in the table this one
derives, and it is the honest reason ``REPAIRED_ELSEWHERE`` is subtracted: not
merely that Romania is already handled, but that this mechanism could not
handle it. Nova Scotia is within reach only because a subdivision row is never
the country default, so both of its windows ship the flag false and nothing has
to move.

The consequence for whoever reads this next: when the seed file grows another
national standard rate change, the pinned population test will fail and bring
you here, and the decision waiting for you is about the flag rather than about
the repair. Do not assume the next rate change is covered.

Israel is that next rate change, and it went the other way, which is worth
recording because it narrows the warning above rather than repealing it. Its
17 % and 18 % windows both ship ``is_default`` true, so nothing has to move and
the predicate matches. That is not a second opinion about what the flag means,
it is what the resolver already reads it as: ``_country_wide_standard`` picks
the flagged row out of the rows *in force on the date being asked about*, and
two windows of one line never overlap, so exactly one is flagged on every date
in either. Romania needs its own repair because the file moves the flag there,
not because a country's standard rate is beyond this mechanism. So the question
to ask of the next pair is the narrow one - does the file move the flag - and
not the broad one about what kind of rate changed.

``subdivision_code`` is the wide one. Requiring the shipped value outright
would break on the cohort this repair serves: a database seeded before v15.7.0
has no subdivision on any row until
:mod:`~app.modules.i18n_foundation.tax_subdivision_repair` fills it in, so the
predicate would depend on which repair the registry happens to run first.
Accepting *any* subdivision would be worse in the other direction - that
sibling repair's docstring explicitly contemplates an operator who moved a rate
to a different province, and closing that row would take the rate away from the
province they moved it to. Empty means the row names no province at all, which
is the unlabelled shape, not a different answer; a different province is
refused.

Be plain about what none of this can do, because it is the same limit Romania
states: **it separates an untouched shipped row from an edited one, and it
cannot separate a tenant deliberately holding 15 % from one nobody ever
updated.** Holding the old rate on purpose requires no edit, so the two are
identical in the table. What makes the repair safe anyway is close-and-add
rather than the predicate: every date before the cut still resolves at 15 %,
and an operator who wants 15 % for new work has one row to re-open rather than
a lost rate to reconstruct.

It must not leave a jurisdiction unable to price
------------------------------------------------
The writes are planned, the planned table is run through ``resolve``, and
nothing is applied to a rate line whose jurisdiction would come out of it
without an answer. That guard is not decoration here. The population this
serves is the one whose province has been mispriced for a year, so some of them
will have entered a rate of their own; a hand-entered Nova Scotia row that also
replaces the federal rate makes the province raise rather than answer, and it
does so both before and after anything this repair could do. Applying to such
an install would edit their data and buy nothing, so it is refused and logged.

``resolve`` raises for that shape rather than returning an unresolved answer -
measured, not assumed - so the guard treats a raise as "no answer" instead of
letting it out into the runner, where it would land as a failed repair and a
red ``/api/health`` on a database this repair had already decided to leave
alone.

The residual limit, stated rather than glossed: for a country-wide window in a
country that charges by subdivision, the guard asks the question with no
subdivision, gets ``subdivision_unknown``, and refuses. No shipped line is in
that shape today. If one ever is, the pinned population is what brings a reader
here first, and a refusal that is logged is the safe direction to fail in.
