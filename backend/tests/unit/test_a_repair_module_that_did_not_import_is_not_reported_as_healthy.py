"""A repairs module that will not import must not come out looking like a clean pass.

The defect
----------
``discover_data_repairs`` imports every ``app/modules/*/repairs.py`` and keeps
going when one of them raises, which is right: one broken module must not stop
the application. What was wrong is what happened next. The error went to the log
and nowhere else, so the module registered nothing, the pass had no outcome for
it, and every published field answered the way it answers for a boot with
nothing wrong in it - ``data_repairs_failed: false``,
``data_repair_ledger_failed: false``, status ``healthy``.

That is the shape this codebase keeps being caught by: a signal that cannot tell
"nothing ran" from "everything is fine". Here it was worse than symmetrical,
because the *more* broken module got the *more* reassuring answer. A repair that
raises against the database was reported; a module so broken it never loaded was
not.

How this is measured
--------------------
The probe modules are written under ``tmp_path`` and ``app.modules.__path__`` is
pointed at them, rather than a file being planted in ``backend/app/modules``.
Two reasons, and the second is the one that bites: a probe left behind by a
crashed test is an untracked file that reddens gates for everybody sharing the
tree, and this particular one would go on being discovered by every boot in that
working copy afterwards.

``__path__`` is *replaced* rather than extended, so discovery sees the probe
packages and nothing else. That makes the pass deterministic no matter what has
already been imported: this registry grows as modules are imported, so a check
written over the real one answers differently depending on what ran before it,
which is the neighbouring trap rather than a way out of this one. It also means
no repair is selected, so the runner can be driven end to end without a
database - a factory that is never opened cannot need one.
