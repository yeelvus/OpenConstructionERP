// Case: "Release a provisional sum and charge the attendance fee" (CN).
//
// A Chinese bill carries a section of items that are not measured work: sums
// the owner holds for scope that is not yet defined, packages that will be
// tendered separately, and the main contractor's fee for coordinating the
// specialists the owner appoints directly. They appear together and they behave
// as a set - the fee has a base only because the packages sit in the bill, and
// the sums only mean anything if the drawdowns against them are recorded.
//
// So the case is about the section as a structure rather than about a register
// in isolation. A provisional sum is held, drawn against as instructions issue,
// and its remaining balance is derived rather than stored, which is the only
// arrangement where the balance cannot go stale. Over-drawing is deliberately
// allowed and flagged rather than blocked, because a system that refuses to
// record what happened is a system people work around. Content strings are key
// plus inline English default and live only here.

  longDescDefault:
    "The items that are not measured work are where a bill quietly stops adding up. A provisional sum is a real commitment of the owner's money against scope nobody has defined yet; a package to be tendered separately is a hole in the bill with a number in it; and the main contractor's coordination fee is a percentage that has to be charged on something specific rather than on the job. Each of the three is easy on its own and they go wrong together, because the fee's base and the sums' balances both depend on how the bill is structured. This case sets the structure first and then runs one sum through its life: held, tendered, let, drawn down, reported. The balance is always derived from the drawdowns rather than stored, so it cannot drift out of step with them, and drawing more than was held is recorded and flagged rather than refused - the register's job is to show you the position, not to prevent the project from having one.",
