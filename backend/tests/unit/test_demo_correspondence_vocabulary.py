"""The demo estate must give every project its own correspondence register.

Two defects, both reported by eye rather than by a gate, both fixed in
``0ada247a8``. What was seeded until then:

* Every demo project outside the five hand-curated ones ran the same ten
  hardcoded English tuples through ``_generate_module_data``. Heidelberg,
  Karlsruhe, New Delhi and Sao Paulo each carried the identical subjects in
  the identical order, on the identical day offsets. A fixed list applied once
  per project is not a register, and four projects opened side by side made
  that obvious to a reader in seconds.
* ``correspondence_type`` declares five values in the module's own schema and
  the seeder exercised three of them. ``notice`` and ``memo`` were legal,
  offered by the type filter, and unreachable in every demo on the platform,
  so two of the five labels selected nothing anywhere.

The vocabulary gate next door, ``test_demo_seed_speaks_module_vocabularies``,
passed throughout and was right to. It asks whether a seeded value falls
outside its schema's vocabulary. Identical registers are individually legal,
and an absent value is not a value, so a per-value check cannot see either
defect by construction. This file asks the two questions it structurally
cannot: are the registers distinct from one another, and does the estate as a
whole reach every word the schema declares.
