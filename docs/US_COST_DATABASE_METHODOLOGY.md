## 1. Overview

The OCERP cost database keeps its entries as **resource-based cost items**. Every item stands for one unit of construction work, for example "Bulk excavation, common earth, machine", and its total rate is **broken down into labor, material, and equipment parts**. Splitting the rate this way gives us several things at once:

- **Transparent costing:** estimators can see *why* a rate ended up where it did instead of just reading a final number.
- **Regional adaptation:** swap in different labor wages or material prices for another market and you do not have to rebuild the item from the ground up.
- **Cross-validation:** line up the calculated rate against actual bid prices and any errors stand out.
- **Sensitivity analysis:** model what happens to cost when wages move, material prices swing, or a different machine is chosen.

This document walks through:

- How we assembled the USA_TENNESSEE pilot out of real government and market data.
- The architecture and schema behind the OCERP cost database.
- A way to decide which cost items a given project type actually requires.
- Where to find, pull, and map data from each of the major US cost sources.
- A repeatable procedure for standing up a brand new regional database.

## 2. How We Built the Pilot: Process Walkthrough

We produced the pilot batch of 12 sitework cost items for Nashville, TN, by following the steps below.

### Phase 1: Identify Required Items (Scope Definition)

We took the TCG Brentwood Sitework project scope as our starting point and pulled out 12 items spread across four categories:

| Category | Items | Division |
|----------|-------|----------|
| Demolition | 4 (house, garage, concrete, asphalt) | 02 |
| Excavation and Grading | 4 (bulk, trench, grading, fill) | 31 |
| Stormwater | 2 (French drain, infiltration pit) | 33 |
| Utilities | 2 (water, sewer service lines) | 33 |

Every item received a readable code (such as `DEM-HSE-01` or `EXC-BLK-01`) plus a unit of measure that matches how the trade conventionally measures that kind of work.

### Phase 2: Source Research

Three free government sources supplied the underlying numbers:

| Source | What It Provided | How We Used It |
|--------|-----------------|----------------|
| **USACE EP 1110-1-8** (Region 3 Southeast, 2022 ed.) | Equipment hourly rates (ownership plus operating) | Machine cost components across every cost item |
| **BLS OEWS** (May 2024, Nashville MSA #34980) | Mean hourly wages by occupation (SOC codes) | Labor cost components |
| **TDOT Average Bid Prices** (2024) | Real bid prices for validation | Sanity check of our calculated rates against the market |

Material rates were put together from local Nashville market estimates (national home-improvement retailers and regional suppliers).

### Phase 3: Component Decomposition

For each cost item we worked out:

1. **The crew and equipment involved.** House demolition, for instance, needs 1 excavator operator plus 2 laborers plus a hydraulic excavator fitted with a grapple.
2. **Productivity rates,** meaning how many hours of each resource go into one unit of work (about 0.06 equipment-hrs/SF for house demolition).
3. **Material quantities,** such as 0.003 dumpster rentals per SF and 0.015 tons of debris per SF.

We then calculated each component cost as `quantity x unit_rate` and set the total rate equal to `sum(component_costs)`.

**Example, DEM-HSE-01 (House Demolition):**

```
rate = sum(components.cost) = $10.33/SF

Component breakdown:
  Labor:     0.12 hrs/SF x $22.45/hr  = $2.69  (Construction Laborers, BLS 47-2061)
  Equipment: 0.06 hrs/SF x $73.58/hr  = $4.41  (Excavator 30T, USACE EXC-30T)
  Material:  0.003 EA/SF x $650/EA    = $1.95  (Dumpster 30-yd)
  Material:  0.015 ton/SF x $85/ton   = $1.28  (Debris disposal)
```

### Phase 4: Validation

We validated in two ways:

1. **Component math:** `abs(rate - sum(components.cost)) < 0.01` holds for all 12 items.
2. **TDOT cross-comparison:** our rates set against TDOT bid prices. Where the scope lines up (French drain at +6.4% variance), our rates land within plus or minus 10%. Where the scope genuinely differs (a residential service line against a highway sewer at -86%), the gap is expected and we document it.

The pilot left behind these files:

```
data/
├── usace_equipment_rates.json   # 14 equipment types from USACE
├── bls_labor_wages.json         # 8 occupations from BLS
├── material_rates.json           # 14 material costs
├── tdot_bid_prices.json          # 14 TDOT bid items for validation
└── us_tn_sitework_costs.json    # 12 CostItems with 78 components
```

## 3. OCERP Cost Database Architecture

```

### 3.2 Key Design Decisions

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Rate storage | `String(50)` | Protects SQLite float precision; parsed to float on read. PostgreSQL is the production DB and SQLite is the zero-config dev fallback |
| Currency fallback | 3-tier chain | Explicit, then region map, then `"EUR"` default. Covers legacy CWICR rows that left currency empty |
| Component type | Free-form JSON list | Allows `labor`, `material`, `equipment`, `subcontractor`, `operator`, `electricity`, `other` |
| Classification | Free-form dict | Holds DIN 276, MasterFormat, UniFormat, NRM, and any other standard at the same time |
| Uniqueness | `(code, region)` | The same code is fine in different regions. Bulk import does not upsert; duplicates are quietly skipped |
| Region format | `COUNTRYCODE_CITY` | Uppercase, underscore-delimited: `USA_TENNESSEE`, `DE_BERLIN`, `GB_LONDON` |
| Search pagination | Keyset cursor | O(1) page fetches; total count cached for 60 min |
| Lite mode | `?lite=true` | Drops the 31KB `components` array for list views; `components_count` still flags "has breakdown" |

### 3.3 API Endpoints Summary

| Method | Path | Purpose | Auth |
|--------|------|---------|------|
| GET | `/costs/` | Search/filter cost items | Public |
| GET | `/costs/autocomplete/` | Fast text autocomplete | Public |
| GET | `/costs/{id}` | Get single item by UUID | Public |
| POST | `/costs/` | Create single item | Editor+ |
| PATCH | `/costs/{id}` | Update item | Editor+ |
| DELETE | `/costs/{id}` | Delete item | Manager+ |
| POST | `/costs/bulk/` | Bulk import JSON array | Editor+ |
| POST | `/costs/import/file/` | Import from Excel/CSV | Editor+ |
| DELETE | `/costs/actions/clear-region/{region}` | Wipe all items in a region | Admin |
| GET | `/costs/regions/` | List distinct regions | Public |
| GET | `/costs/regions/stats/` | Region row counts | Public |
| POST | `/costs/match/` | CWICR text matcher | Public |
| POST | `/costs/match-from-position/` | Match from BOQ position | Public |

### 3.4 Catalog Module (`backend/app/modules/catalog/`)

Once cost items are loaded, the resources inside their component arrays can be pulled out into the **Resource Catalog**, where they become reusable in assemblies and the BOQ editor.

```
backend/app/modules/catalog/
├── models.py           # CatalogResource ORM model (oe_catalog_resource table)
├── schemas.py          # Pydantic request/response schemas
├── repository.py       # Database queries (search, stats, bulk ops)
├── service.py          # Business logic including extraction from cost items
├── router.py           # FastAPI routes (REST API)
├── permissions.py      # Role-based access control (catalog.extract requires Manager+)
└── manifest.py         # Module registration (depends on oe_costs)
```

**The core idea:** the Resource Catalog holds **leaf resources**, the individual materials, equipment items, labor rates, and operators that get extracted out of the `components` arrays of cost items. Assemblies can then reference those resources and they can be applied straight onto BOQ positions.

**The extraction flow runs like this:**
1. Import cost items, each with its `components[]` array, into `oe_costs_item`.
2. Run `CatalogResourceService.import_region_from_costs(region)` or call `POST /catalog/extract/`.
3. Components are grouped by `(code, type)`, averages are computed, and the results are written into `oe_catalog_resource`.
4. The extracted resources show up in the catalog UI under their region tab (for example `USA_TENNESSEE`).

> **Note:** The "My Catalog" tab on `/catalog` only lists `region='CUSTOM'` resources. Extracted regional resources land on their own region tab instead.

## 4. CostItem Schema Reference

### 4.1 Database Model (`oe_costs_item`)

| Column | Type | Nullable | Default | Notes |
|--------|------|----------|---------|-------|
| `id` | UUID | PK | auto | |
| `code` | `String(100)` | NO | - | Unique per region. E.g. `"DEM-HSE-01"` or `"03.330.10"` |
| `description` | `Text` | NO | - | Primary human-readable description |
| `descriptions` | `JSON` | NO | `{}` | Localized: `{"en": "House demolition", "de": "Haushaltabbruch"}` |
| `unit` | `String(20)` | NO | - | Measurement unit: `SF`, `CY`, `LF`, `EA`, `hr`, `m`, `m2`, `m3`, `kg`, `pcs` |
| `rate` | `String(50)` | NO | - | Unit rate stored as a string for SQLite compatibility |
| `currency` | `String(10)` | NO | `""` | ISO 4217 code. Resolved from region if left empty |
| `source` | `String(50)` | NO | `"cwicr"` | Data provenance: `cwicr`, `commercial`, `manual`, `file_import`, `custom` |
| `classification` | `JSON` | NO | `{}` | Multi-standard: `{"masterformat": "03 30 00", "din276": "330"}` |
| `components` | `JSON` | NO | `[]` | Resource breakdown: `[{type, name, quantity, unit_rate, cost, unit}]` |
| `tags` | `JSON` | NO | `[]` | Searchable: `["demolition", "sitework", "nashville"]` |
| `region` | `String(50)` | YES | `None` | E.g. `USA_TENNESSEE`, `DE_BERLIN` |
| `is_active` | `Boolean` | NO | `True` | Soft-delete |
| `metadata_` | `JSON` | NO | `{}` | Column name `metadata`; arbitrary key-value store |

**Unique constraint:** `uq_costs_code_region` covers `(code, region)`

### 4.2 Component Schema

Every entry in the `components` array has this shape:

```json
{
  "type": "labor",              // "labor" | "material" | "equipment" | "subcontractor" | "other"
  "name": "Construction Laborers (SOC 47-2061)",  // Descriptive name
  "quantity": 0.12,             // Quantity per parent unit
  "unit_rate": 22.45,           // Rate per component unit
  "cost": 2.69,                 // quantity x unit_rate (MUST sum to parent rate)
  "unit": "hr",                 // Component unit (hr, SF, CY, EA, ton, etc.)
  "code": "LAB-2061"            // Required for catalog extraction; optional otherwise. Auto-generated by the import script if missing
}
```

**The rule to enforce:**

```python
assert abs(rate - sum(c["cost"] for c in components)) < 0.01
```

The parent `rate` has to match the sum of all component `cost` values to within $0.01. The import script enforces this, and you should run the check before any bulk import.

### 4.3 Classification Dict

The `classification` field carries one or more classification standard codes:

```json
{
  "division": "02",
  "section": "4100",
  "category": "Demolition of selected structures",
  "masterformat": "02 41 00",
  "uniformat": "G2020"
}
```

For the 4-level CWICR tree, OCERP uses `collection`, then `department`, then `section`, then `subsection`. Standard classification codes go under their own keys such as `masterformat`, `din276`, or `nrm`.

### 4.4 Metadata Dict

The `metadata_` field is a free-form bag for extension data:

```json
{
  "labor_hours": 0.12,
  "equipment_hours": 0.06,
  "data_sources": ["USACE EP 1110-1-8", "BLS OEWS May 2024"],
  "validation_status": "pilot",
  "tdot_comparison": {
    "tdot_item": "203-01",
    "tdot_rate_2024": 21.42,
    "variance_pct": -41.9
  }
}
```

## 5. The Resource-Based Costing Method

### 5.1 What Is Resource-Based Costing?

Resource-based costing takes a unit rate apart into the resources that make it up:

```
total_rate = Σ(labor_costs) + Σ(equipment_costs) + Σ(material_costs)
           = Σ(quantity_i x unit_rate_i) for each component i
```

This is a different approach from **unit-price estimating**, which carries one rate per unit of work with no breakdown, and from **parametric estimating**, where the rate comes from building characteristics like $/SF.

### 5.2 Why Resource-Based?

| Advantage | Explanation |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Transparency** | Estimators see *why* a rate is $10.33/SF, not just the bottom line |
| **Regional adaptation** | Swap Nashville labor wages for Denver wages and the rates update on their own |
| **Time adjustment** | Move equipment rates from the USACE 2022 edition to 2026 and costs follow |
| **Cross-validation** | Compare calculated rates against TDOT or commercial cost-database bid prices |
| **Sensitivity analysis** | Model the impact of wage changes, material price volatility, or equipment choice |
| **Audit trail** | Each component points back to its source (a BLS SOC code, a USACE equipment code, a market rate) |

### 5.3 Productivity Rates

The make-or-break input is the **productivity rate**, the number of hours of each resource needed per unit of work. Common sources for productivity rates:

| Source | Type | Best For |
|--------|------|----------|
| Commercial unit-cost database | Published manhours/unit | General building |
| Commercial estimator handbook | Published manhours/unit | Residential/light commercial |
| Commercial heavy-civil database | Published manhours/unit | Heavy civil/industrial |
| USACE EP 1110-1-8 | Equipment hours/unit (derived) | Government work |
| DOT standard specifications | Implicit in bid items | Highway/infrastructure |
| Historic project data | Your own records | Project-specific |
| Crew analysis | Engineering judgment | Custom assemblies |

### 5.4 Component Decomposition Template

Run each cost item through this template:

```
1. Define the scope of work (what's included/excluded)
2. Identify the crew composition:
   - Which trades? -> BLS SOC codes -> labor hourly rate
   - How many workers per crew? -> labor hours per unit
3. Identify the equipment:
   - Which machines? -> USACE/FEMA equipment code -> equipment hourly rate
   - How many hours per unit? -> equipment hours per unit
4. Identify the materials:
   - What materials? -> material code -> material unit price
   - What quantity per unit? -> material quantity per parent unit
5. Add incidentals:
   - Dumpster rentals, water, marking paint, silt fence, etc.
6. Compute:
   component_cost = quantity x unit_rate
   total_rate = round(sum(component_costs), 2)
7. Validate:
   abs(total_rate - sum(component_costs)) < 0.01
8. Cross-check against bid prices
```

### 5.5 Example: French Drain (SW-FRN-01)

**Scope:** Trench excavation, geotextile wrap, #57 stone fill, 4" perforated PVC pipe, backfill, and compaction. Priced per linear foot.

**Crew and equipment:**
- Operating Engineer (excavator operator, SOC 47-2073): 0.08 hr/LF x $25.58/hr
- Pipelayer (pipe installation, SOC 47-2151): 0.10 hr/LF x $22.77/hr
- Construction Laborer (backfill/compaction, SOC 47-2061): 0.10 hr/LF x $22.45/hr
- Excavator 20-ton: 0.08 hr/LF x $60.94/hr
- Vibratory Roller 5.2-ton: 0.04 hr/LF x $30.73/hr

**Materials going in:**
- 4" PVC perforated pipe: 1.05 LF/LF x $3.50/LF (5% waste allowance)
- #57 stone: 0.08 CY/LF x $45.00/CY
- Geotextile fabric: 6.0 SF/LF x $0.85/SF
- Sand bedding: 0.03 CY/LF x $35.00/CY
- PVC fittings: 1.00 LF/LF x $1.88/LF

**Rolled-up result:**
```
rate = $28.00/LF = 2.05 + 2.28 + 2.25 + 4.88 + 1.23 + 3.68 + 3.60 + 5.10 + 1.05 + 1.88
```

**Validation:** The TDOT 2024 average bid price for Filter Cloth Underdrain (Item 710-04) is $26.31/LF. That puts our variance at +6.4%.

## 6. How to Determine What Cost Items Are Needed

### 6.1 Scope-Driven Approach

**Begin from the project scope of work, not from whatever data sources happen to be on hand.**

1. **Identify the project type.** Sitework, building, highway, utility? Each maps onto a particular set of specification divisions.

2. **List the work items from the scope.**
   - Sitework: demolition, earthwork, stormwater, utilities.
   - Building: foundations, structure, envelope, MEP, finishes.
   - Highway: earthwork, paving, drainage, traffic, landscaping.

3. **Map each work item to a cost item code,** drawing on the project specification or the estimator's work breakdown structure.

4. **Validate coverage.** For every specification division in the project, confirm the cost database covers 80% or more of the estimated value.

### 6.2 Division Coverage for Sitework

Division numbers are cited as interoperability facts; the work descriptions are our own. The official division and section titles are proprietary and are deliberately not reproduced here - licence holders can import the official tables into the classification module themselves.

| Division | Key Items |
|----------|-----------|
| 02 | Demolition, site assessment, hazardous material survey |
| 31 | Excavation, fill, grading, compaction, dewatering |
| 32 | Paving, landscaping, fencing, irrigation |
| 33 | Water, sewer, storm drain, gas, electric, communications |
| 34 | Roadways, bridges, rail, signage |

### 6.3 Project-Type Templates

When you spin up a new regional database, start from a project-type template:

**Sitework (Residential Subdivision, 20 items):**
```
Demolition (4): house, garage, concrete, asphalt removal      -> 02 41 00
Excavation (4): bulk, trench, grading, fill                   -> 31 23 00
Stormwater (2): French drain, infiltration pit                -> 33 46 00
Water utility (1): water service line                         -> 33 11 00
Sewer utility (1): sewer service line                         -> 33 30 00
Erosion control (4): silt fence, entrance, stabilization      -> 31 25 00
Paving (2): asphalt base, asphalt surface                     -> 32 12 00
Fencing (2): chain-link fence, temporary construction fence   -> 32 31 00
```

**Heavy Highway (30 or more items):**
- Division 31 items for cut, fill, and haul.
- State DOT standard bid items for paving, drainage, and striping.
- Additional items for utility relocation.

### 6.4 Coverage Analysis Method

Once a region's cost database is built, check coverage across four angles:

1. **By division.** Does the database hold items for every specification division that applies?
2. **By value.** Do the top 20 items by estimated project value all have cost entries?
3. **By bid item.** Can 80% or more of the project's bid items be mapped onto cost entries?
4. **By source.** Are all components (labor, material, equipment) drawn from current data?

### 6.5 Prioritization When Starting a New Region

When building a region from scratch:

1. **Lay down the labor, equipment, and material rate tables first.** These are the building blocks for everything else.
2. **Build the highest-value items first.** Excavation, concrete, and pipe work tend to make up 60 to 70% of sitework value.
3. **Validate each batch against local bid prices** (TDOT, CALTRANS, and so on).
4. **Add detail in waves.** A first batch can carry simplified components; later batches fill in variants, alternates, and finer detail.

## 7. External Cost Data Sources

We group the sources into three tiers: **Government Free** (authoritative, no cost), **Commercial Subscription** (comprehensive, paid), and **Industry Free/Low-Cost** (partial, accessible).

### 7.1 Government Free Sources

#### 7.1.1 USACE EP 1110-1-8: Equipment Ownership and Operating Rates

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **What** | Hourly equipment rates (ownership plus operating) by machine type, size, condition |
| **Regions** | 12 US regions (Northeast through Pacific) |
| **Update** | Sporadic (current edition 2022) |
| **Access** | Free PDF download |
| **URL** | https://www.usace.army.mil/Missions/Cost-Engineering/EP1110-1-8/ |

**Our use:** Equipment cost components in every cost item. We parsed the 2022 Region 3 (Southeast) data and stored it in `data/usace_equipment_rates.json`.

**Limitations:** The data dates from 2011 with 2022 rate adjustments. It does not carry operator labor, which comes from a separate BLS wage. The rates are machine-only.

**Better alternative:** the FEMA Schedule of Equipment Rates (annual updates, around 530 items, national scope):
- URL: https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/documents/fema_pa_schedule-equipment-rates_2025.pdf
- Also on data.gov as dataset FEMA-0359

#### 7.1.2 BLS OEWS: Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **What** | Mean/median hourly and annual wages by SOC occupation code, by metro area |
| **Regions** | National, state, 400+ metro areas |
| **Update** | Annual (May data, released about 18 months later) |
| **Access** | Free API (v2.2) plus downloadable CSV/XLSX |
| **URL** | https://www.bls.gov/oes/tables.htm |
| **API** | https://www.bls.gov/bls/api_features.htm |

**Our use:** Labor cost components. Nashville MSA (34980) May 2024 data is stored in `data/bls_labor_wages.json`.

**The construction SOC codes that matter most:**

| SOC Code | Occupation | Typical Use |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| 47-2061 | Construction Laborers | Ground crew, cleanup, manual labor |
| 47-2073 | Operating Engineers | Equipment operators |
| 47-2151 | Pipelayers | Pipe installation |
| 47-2051 | Cement Masons | Concrete work |
| 47-2031 | Carpenters | Formwork, woodwork |
| 47-2111 | Electricians | Electrical utility work |
| 47-2152 | Plumbers | Water/sewer connections |
| 37-3013 | Tree Trimmers | Clearing, site prep |
| 47-2211 | Ironworkers | Structural steel, rebar |

**Limitations:** These are mean wages, not prevailing (Davis-Bacon) wages. On federally funded projects, use Davis-Bacon determinations instead.

#### 7.1.3 Davis-Bacon Wage Determinations

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **What** | Legally binding prevailing wage rates by county, by construction type |
| **Regions** | County-level for all US states and territories |
| **Update** | Annual general determinations plus modifications |
| **Access** | Free on SAM.gov |
| **URL** | https://sam.gov (Wage Determinations tab) |

**When to use:** Davis-Bacon rates are **mandatory** on federally funded construction over $2,000. They usually run 25 to 40% higher than BLS mean wages because they reflect union and collective bargaining rates.

**How to extract:** There is no bulk API. Determinations are individual HTML pages on SAM.gov. A scraper has to enumerate WD numbers by state plus construction type (Building, Heavy, Highway, Residential).

#### 7.1.4 State DOT Bid Prices

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **What** | Average unit bid prices from awarded contracts |
| **Regions** | State-wide (some states publish district-level too) |
| **Update** | Annual or quarterly |
| **Access** | Free from state DOT websites |
| **Best states** | TN, CA, FL, WI, TX, NY (via a third-party DOT data portal) |

**Our use:** Cross-validation of our calculated rates against real market prices. The TDOT 2024 data lives in `data/tdot_bid_prices.json`.

**Where each state DOT publishes:**

| State | URL | Format |
|-------|-----|--------|
| Tennessee | https://www.tn.gov/tdot/.../transportation-construction-price-information.html | Excel/PDF |
| California | https://sv08data.dot.ca.gov/ | Interactive web DB |
| Florida | https://www.fdot.gov/fpo/fpc/reports/historicalitemaveragecost | Power BI |
| Wisconsin | https://wisconsindot.gov/.../average-unit-price.pdf | PDF |
| Texas | https://www.txdot.gov/.../average-low-bid-prices.html | Excel |
| New York | Via a third-party DOT data portal | Web platform |

**Key insight:** DOT bid prices are the **gold standard for sitework and civil unit costs** because they track actual market conditions. They are, however, composite rates that bundle labor plus material plus equipment plus overhead plus profit into one figure, not resource-decomposed. Use them for **validation**, not as component sources.

### 7.2 Commercial Subscription Sources

#### 7.2.1 Commercial Unit-Cost Databases

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **What** | Large commercial unit-cost line-item databases (tens of thousands of items) with labor/material/equipment breakdowns, crew compositions, daily outputs, and city cost indexes |
| **Regions** | National average plus hundreds of city adjustment factors |
| **Update** | Typically quarterly |
| **Format** | Online, print, API (enterprise) |
| **Access** | Paid subscription; imported into OCERP as XLSX/CSV |

**Why they matter:** a comprehensive commercial unit-cost database lines up almost perfectly with OCERP's `components` field (labor plus material plus equipment breakdown, crew compositions). MasterFormat line numbering maps straight onto `classification.masterformat`.

**How the fields line up:**

```
source line number   -> code (e.g., "US-033053.40-3950")
source description    -> description
source unit           -> unit
source bare cost      -> rate
source city index     -> metadata.city_cost_index
source crew details   -> components (labor, material, equipment)
source division        -> classification.masterformat
```

**Limitation:** commercial cost data is copyrighted and *cannot be redistributed freely*. For OCERP it can ship as a premium data connector that users subscribe to separately, or serve as a reference and benchmarking source during development.

#### 7.2.2 Commercial Estimator Handbooks

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **What** | Mid-size unit-cost references (several thousand items) with manhours, crew sizes, labor/material/total costs |
| **Regions** | National with area modification factors |
| **Update** | Annual editions |
| **Format** | PDF, print, cloud, API (licensing available) |
| **Access** | Low-cost book or subscription; imported as XLSX/CSV |

**Why they matter:** an affordable commercial estimator handbook is a good fit for residential and light commercial work, often with API access for integration, and it maps directly onto OCERP components.

#### 7.2.3 Published Construction Cost Indexes

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **What** | Construction cost escalation indexes (building and general construction) plus material prices across a set of cities |
| **Regions** | Around 20 US cities plus national average |
| **Update** | Monthly |
| **Access** | Paid subscription; index values imported as XLSX/CSV |

**Why they matter:** published cost indexes are not unit cost databases, but they are essential for **time-adjusting historical costs** into current dollars. The building and general construction indexes are the most widely cited construction inflation measures. The multi-city material price data (concrete, steel, lumber) can populate individual `CostItem` entries with `source: "enr_materials"`.

#### 7.2.4 Commercial Heavy-Civil / Industrial Databases

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **What** | Very large line-item databases (100,000+ items across hundreds of phases). Heavy civil/industrial focus. Manhours, materials, equipment, subcontractor pricing |
| **Regions** | 100+ North American labor markets; some international coverage |
| **Access** | Paid subscription; imported as XLSX/CSV |

**Why they matter:** a commercial heavy-civil database is the best source for heavy civil and industrial process-plant estimating. Its per-labor-market rates are more granular than BLS OEWS, and the phase structure lines up with sitework scope.

### 7.3 Industry Free / Low-Cost Sources

#### 7.3.1 Building Valuation Datasets

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **What** | $/SF construction costs by occupancy group and construction type |
| **Regions** | National with regional modifiers |
| **Update** | Semi-annual |
| **Access** | Published by code / membership bodies; imported as XLSX/CSV |

**Use case:** Conceptual and square-foot estimating only. Not suited to detailed estimating, but handy for order-of-magnitude validation.

#### 7.3.2 Replacement-Cost Valuation Databases

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **What** | Square-foot and unit-in-place replacement costs for insurance and tax assessment |
| **Regions** | US and Canada with local multipliers |
| **Access** | Paid subscription; imported as XLSX/CSV |

**Use case:** Building valuation rather than sitework. The segregated cost breakdowns could populate OCERP `components` for building-level items.

## 8. Source-to-Schema Mapping Reference

### 8.1 Universal Mapping Template

Every external source resolves to the same OCERP `CostItemCreate` schema. Here is the universal mapping:

```
source item identifier     -> code
source item description    -> description
source unit                 -> unit
source rate/price           -> rate
source geographic region    -> region (transformed to COUNTRYCODE_CITY)
source currency             -> currency (ISO 4217)
source classification       -> classification (transformed to standard keys)
source labor/equip/material -> components (resource-based decomposition)
source metadata             -> metadata (provenance, effective dates, source URLs)
source tags                 -> tags
source identifier           -> source field ("usace", "bls_oews", "commercial", etc.)
```

### 8.2 Per-Source Mapping Details

#### USACE / FEMA Equipment Rates -> CostItem

```json
{
  "code": "USACE-EXC-30T",
  "description": "Hydraulic Excavator, Crawler, 30-ton class (CAT 326F, 0.69 CY)",
  "unit": "hr",
  "rate": 73.58,
  "currency": "USD",
  "source": "usace_ep1110",
  "region": "USA_SOUTHEAST",
  "classification": {"masterformat": "01 54 00", "equipment_type": "excavator"},
  "components": [
    {"type": "equipment", "name": "Ownership cost (depreciation + FCCM)", "quantity": 1, "unit_rate": 20.77, "cost": 20.77, "unit": "hr"},
    {"type": "equipment", "name": "Operating cost (fuel, tires, repairs)", "quantity": 1, "unit_rate": 52.81, "cost": 52.81, "unit": "hr"},
    {"type": "labor", "name": "Operator (Operating Engineer, SOC 47-2073)", "quantity": 1, "unit_rate": 25.58, "cost": 25.58, "unit": "hr"}
  ],
  "tags": ["equipment", "excavator", "heavy-civil", "usace"],
  "metadata": {
    "ownership_rate": 20.77,
    "operating_rate": 52.81,
    "condition": "average",
    "effective_date": "2022-12-01",
    "usace_region": "3"
  }
}
```

**Note:** the USACE rate is machine-only at $73.58/hr. Operator labor ($25.58/hr from BLS) is layered in as a separate component, which brings the fully burdened rate to $99.16/hr.

#### BLS OEWS Labor Rates -> CostItem

```json
{
  "code": "BLS-47-2061",
  "description": "Construction Laborers, Nashville-Davidson-Murfreesboro-Franklin, TN MSA",
  "unit": "hr",
  "rate": 22.45,
  "currency": "USD",
  "source": "bls_oews",
  "region": "USA_TENNESSEE",
  "classification": {"soc": "47-2061", "masterformat": "01 54 00"},
  "components": [],
  "tags": ["labor", "general", "construction", "nashville"],
  "metadata": {
    "soc_code": "47-2061",
    "msa_code": "34980",
    "mean_hourly_wage": 22.45,
    "median_hourly_wage": 18.96,
    "effective_date": "2024-05",
    "data_type": "mean"
  }
}
```

#### TDOT Bid Prices -> CostItem (Validation Only)

Bid prices are **composite rates** (labor plus material plus equipment plus overhead plus profit). Do not break them into components unless you have the breakdown from another source. Store them instead as **reference items** with `source: "tdot_bid"` and lean on them for cross-validation:

```json
{
  "code": "TDOT-710-04",
  "description": "Filter Cloth Underdrain (With Pipe) [French Drain]",
  "unit": "LF",
  "rate": 26.31,
  "currency": "USD",
  "source": "tdot_bid",
  "region": "USA_TENNESSEE",
  "classification": {"tdot_item": "710-04", "masterformat": "33 46 00"},
  "components": [],
  "tags": ["validation", "french_drain", "stormwater", "tdot"],
  "metadata": {
    "tdot_item_no": "710-04",
    "year": 2024,
    "is_composite": true,
    "includes_overhead_profit": true
  }
}
```

#### Commercial Cost Database -> CostItem (Conceptual Mapping)

```json
{
  "code": "COM-312313.10-0400",
  "description": "Excavation, trench, common earth, 0-4 ft deep, machine",
  "unit": "CY",
  "rate": 18.50,
  "currency": "USD",
  "source": "commercial",
  "region": "USA_USD",
  "classification": {"masterformat": "31 23 13.10", "uniformat": "G10"},
  "components": [
    {"type": "labor", "name": "Crew C-1 (1 laborer)", "quantity": 0.35, "unit_rate": 22.45, "cost": 7.86, "unit": "hr"},
    {"type": "equipment", "name": "Hydraulic excavator 3/4 CY", "quantity": 0.35, "unit_rate": 25.49, "cost": 8.92, "unit": "hr"},
    {"type": "material", "name": "No material", "quantity": 0, "unit_rate": 0, "cost": 0, "unit": "CY"}
  ],
  "tags": ["excavation", "trench", "earthwork", "commercial"],
  "metadata": {"city_cost_index": 1.0, "source_line": "312313.10-0400"}
}
```

### 8.3 Common Source Tags

Apply these `source` field values consistently:

| Source Tag | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `usace_ep1110` | USACE EP 1110-1-8 equipment rates |
| `fema_equipment` | FEMA Schedule of Equipment Rates |
| `bls_oews` | BLS Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics |
| `davis_bacon` | Davis-Bacon prevailing wage determinations |
| `tdot_bid` | Tennessee DOT average bid prices |

| `marshall_swift` | Replacement-cost valuation data |
| `richardson` | Commercial heavy-civil cost database |
| `icc_bvd` | Building valuation dataset |
| `cwicr` | DDC CWICR database (legacy) |
| `manual` | Manually compiled from multiple sources |
| `file_import` | Imported from a user-uploaded spreadsheet |
| `custom` | User-created custom items |

---

## 9. Classification Systems

### 9.1 MasterFormat (CSI)

This is the primary classification standard for US construction cost data. Divisions are numbered in the 00 to 49 band, of which 35 are assigned and the rest stay reserved, and each carries hierarchical section numbers.

**The sitework divisions OCERP leans on** (numbers are interoperability facts; the work descriptions are our own - the official division titles are proprietary and are not reproduced in this repository):

| Division | Typical Items |
|----------|---------------|
| 01 | Project management, temporary facilities |
| 02 | Demolition, site assessment, environmental remediation |
| 31 | Excavation, fill, grading, compaction, dewatering |
| 32 | Paving, landscaping, fencing, irrigation |
| 33 | Water, sewer, storm drain, gas, electric, communications |
| 34 | Roadways, bridges, rail, signage, markings |

**In the `classification` dict this reads as:**

```json
{"masterformat": "31 23 13"}
```

### 9.2 Elemental classification (UNIFORMAT II)

An assembly-level classification aimed at early-stage estimating, built from letter-based elements with numeric subdivisions. Element names below follow the public-domain elemental classification published by NIST (SP 841, 1992); the letter designators (G10-G40) follow the later federal publication NISTIR 6389. No proprietary edition is reproduced.

**The sitework elements you will use:**

| Element | Name |
|---------|------|
| G10 | Site Preparation |
| G20 | Site Improvements |
| G30 | Site Civil/Mechanical Utilities |
| G40 | Site Electrical Utilities |

**In the `classification` dict this reads as:**

```json
{"uniformat": "G30"}
```

### 9.3 Using Both Together

OCERP's `classification` dict can hold several standards at once:

```json
{
  "division": "02",
  "section": "4100",
  "category": "Demolition of selected structures",
  "masterformat": "02 41 00",
  "uniformat": "G10"
}
```

The CWICR import relies on `collection`, `department`, `section`, and `subsection` for its 4-level tree. US items can carry `masterformat` and `uniformat` right alongside the CWICR keys.

---

## 10. Step-by-Step: Building a New Regional Database

### 10.1 Define Scope

1. Pick the region (for example `USA_COLORADO`, `USA_SEATTLE`, `CA_TORONTO`).
2. Decide the project type (sitework, building, highway, utility).
3. List the specification divisions to cover.
4. Estimate the item count (12 to 30 makes a reasonable pilot).

### 10.2 Gather Source Data

| Data Need | Primary Source | Alternative | Format |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|--------|
| Equipment rates | FEMA Schedule (free, current) | USACE EP 1110-1-8 | PDF -> JSON |
| Labor wages | BLS OEWS (free API) | Davis-Bacon (county-level) | CSV/XLSX -> JSON |
| Material prices | Local supplier quotes | Home-improvement retailer websites | Manual -> JSON |
| Bid prices (validation) | State DOT website | Third-party DOT data portal | Excel/PDF -> JSON |
| Productivity rates | Commercial cost database (paid) | Commercial estimator handbook (paid) | API/book -> JSON |

### 10.3 Create Reference Data Files

Mirror the pilot structure and create these under `data/`:

```python
data/
├── {region}_equipment_rates.json    # Hourly equipment rates
├── {region}_labor_wages.json         # Hourly wages by occupation
├── {region}_material_rates.json       # Material prices
├── {region}_bid_prices.json           # Validation bid prices
└── {region}_cost_items.json          # Final CostItem array (import this)
```

### 10.4 Build Cost Items

For each cost item:

1. **Identify the crew composition** (trades, count, hours).
2. **Identify the equipment** (types, hours).
3. **Identify the materials** (quantities, units).
4. **Look up unit rates** from your reference data.
5. **Calculate each component cost** as quantity x unit_rate.
6. **Sum the component costs** to get the total rate.
7. **Validate** that the rate rounds to 2 decimal places.
8. **Cross-check** against bid prices (plus or minus 30% tolerance on a first pass).

### 10.5 Validation Checklist

Work through this list before you import:

- [ ] Each item satisfies `rate == sum(components.cost)` to within $0.01
- [ ] Each item carries a `region` (for example `USA_TENNESSEE`)
- [ ] Each item carries a `currency` (for example `USD`), or it will resolve from the region
- [ ] Each item carries a `source` (for example `manual`)
- [ ] Each component `type` is one of `labor`, `material`, `equipment`, `subcontractor`, `other`
- [ ] Every component `quantity` and `unit_rate` is a positive number
- [ ] Every component `cost` equals round(`quantity` x `unit_rate`, 2)
- [ ] There are no duplicate `(code, region)` pairs
- [ ] Classification codes line up with the standard you intend (MasterFormat, and so on)
- [ ] Tags are lowercase and on-topic
- [ ] Rates sit in the right unit (SF, CY, LF, EA, not SY, CF, and the like)

### 10.6 Add Region to Currency Map

In `backend/app/modules/costs/schemas.py` and `router.py`, add the new region to `_REGION_CURRENCY_FALLBACK`:

```python
"USA_TENNESSEE": "USD",
"USA_COLORADO": "USD",
```

### 10.7 Import

```bash
# Import using the recommended script
python scripts/import_tennessee_costs.py \
  --email you@example.com \
  --password "your-password" \
  --port 8000 \
  --data-dir /tmp/tn_import/tn_import_package/data
```

Or call the bulk API directly:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/costs/bulk/ \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @data/usa_colorado_cost_items.json
```

---

## 11. Validation and Quality Assurance

### 11.1 Component Math Validation

**The check:** `abs(rate - sum(component_costs)) < 0.01`

```python
for item in cost_items:
    total = item["rate"]
    calculated = sum(c["cost"] for c in item["components"])
    assert abs(total - calculated) < 0.01, f"{item['code']}: {total} != {calculated}"
```

### 11.2 Bid Price Cross-Validation

Set the calculated rates against local DOT bid prices:

```python
variance_pct = (our_rate - tdot_rate) / tdot_rate * 100
```

**How to read the variance:**

| Variance | Assessment |
|----------|------------|
| plus or minus 5% | Excellent match |
| plus or minus 10% | Good match |
| plus or minus 15 to 20% | Acceptable for a first pass |
| plus or minus 20 to 30% | Needs investigation (scope differences likely) |
| over plus or minus 30% | Investigate; could be scope, productivity, or source data |

**What usually drives the variance:**
- Our rates are **direct cost only**; DOT prices fold in 15 to 25% overhead and profit.
- DOT items often pull in more scope (traffic control, erosion control, mobilization).
- Scale differences, such as residential sitework against highway heavy civil.
- Davis-Bacon (prevailing) wages against BLS (mean) wages.

### 11.3 Reasonableness Checks

| Check | Method |
|-------|--------|
| Labor hours per unit | Compare to published commercial manhour tables |
| Equipment hours per unit | Compare to USACE productivity guides |
| Material quantities per unit | Verify against construction takeoff standards |
| Total rate per SF/CY/LF | Compare to similar items in other regions (CWICR for EUR, a commercial database for USD) |
| Component cost percentages | For sitework, labor is usually 30 to 50%, material 30 to 50%, equipment 10 to 30% |

### 11.4 Continuity Checks

As you add items to a region that already has data:

- [ ] There are no `(code, region)` duplicates
- [ ] Units stay consistent within a category (all demolition items in SF, or all in CY, never mixed)
- [ ] Rate ordering is logical (house demolition costs more per SF than garage demolition)
- [ ] New items do not clash with CWICR or imported items (search by code and description)

---

## 12. Importing Data into OCERP

### 12.1 Bulk JSON Import

This is the main route for importing curated cost items:

```bash
TOKEN=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/users/auth/login/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"you@example.com","password":"your-password"}' | python3 -c "import sys,json; print(json.load(sys.stdin)['access_token'])")

curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/costs/bulk/ \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @data/us_tn_sitework_costs.json
```

**Behavior:** it creates all items and skips any where `(code, region)` already exists (no upsert). It returns the list of created items.

### 12.2 File Import (Excel/CSV)

For quick imports straight from spreadsheets:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/costs/import/file/ \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -F "file=@data/cost_items.xlsx"
```

**Columns the parser recognises automatically:** `code`, `description`, `unit`, `rate`/`price`, `currency`, `classification`/`din 276`/`masterformat`

**Limitations:** file import does not handle `components` arrays. For resource-based items, go through the bulk JSON import.

### 12.3 Python Import Script

The recommended script is `scripts/import_tennessee_costs.py`, which:

1. Authenticates through the regular user login (`POST /users/auth/login/`).
2. Loads every JSON data file from a directory.
3. Auto-generates component `code` fields where they are missing (required for catalog extraction).
4. Validates `rate == sum(components.cost)` for each item.
5. Calls `POST /costs/bulk/`.
6. Verifies the items by searching the API.

> **Note:** `scripts/import_cost_database.py` is the legacy script that uses demo auth on port 8082. It is deprecated for production use.

### 12.4 CWICR Catalog Import

For large CWICR regional catalogs (55K+ items per region):

```bash
# List available catalogs
curl -s http://localhost:8000/api/v1/costs/catalogues/ | python3 -m json.tool

# Load a catalog
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/costs/load-cwicr/DE_BERLIN \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

This downloads parquet data from GitHub, deduplicates it, extracts components, and bulk-inserts. The source is set to `"cwicr"`.

### 12.5 Clearing a Region

To wipe all items for a region before re-importing:

```bash
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8000/api/v1/costs/actions/clear-region/USA_TENNESSEE \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

**This cannot be undone.** Use it with care.

### 12.6 Catalog Resource Extraction

After importing cost items with `components[]` arrays, pull their individual resources into the catalog so they can be reused in assemblies and the BOQ editor.

**Why bother extracting:**
- Components without a `code` field are **silently skipped** during extraction.
- Extracted resources become searchable in the catalog UI.
- They can be picked directly when building assemblies or adding resources to BOQ positions.
- Each resource reports avg/min/max rates and a usage count across all cost items in the region.

**With the standalone script:**

```bash
cd backend
python -m app.scripts.extract_tennessee_catalog
```

**Using the API** (requires the `catalog.extract` permission, i.e. a Manager or Admin role):

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/catalog/extract/ \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

**Confirm the extraction worked:**

```bash
# List regions with catalog resources
curl -s http://localhost:8000/api/v1/catalog/regions/ \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" | jq .

# Search Tennessee catalog resources
curl -s "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/catalog/?region=USA_TENNESSEE&limit=5" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" | jq '.total'
```

**The component `code` requirement:**

The extraction service groups components by their `code` field. A component with no `code` gets skipped:

```python
code = comp.get("code", "")
if not code:
    continue  # silently skipped
```

The import script (`scripts/import_tennessee_costs.py`) auto-generates codes in the form `TN-{TYPE}-{slug}` when they are missing.

## Appendix B: Region Naming Convention

OCERP accepts several region key formats. The legacy CWICR catalogues follow two conventions.

### Currency-based regions (broad markets)

CWICR uses these for national and regional price databases:

```
USA_USD           # United States (broad market, USD currency)
UK_GBP            # United Kingdom (broad market, GBP currency)
DE___DDC_CWICR    # Germany (CWICR internal identifier)
```

### Location-based regions (specific metros/states)

These cover custom or city-specific data:

```
USA_TENNESSEE     # Tennessee (state-level)
USA_COLORADO      # Colorado (state-level)
USA_SEATTLE       # Seattle metro
USA_CHICAGO       # Chicago metro
CA_TORONTO        # Toronto, Canada
DE_BERLIN         # Berlin, Germany
FR_PARIS          # Paris, France
PT_SAOPAULO       # São Paulo, Brazil
```

### Custom region guidelines

When you create new custom regions:

1. **Prefer `COUNTRYCODE_STATE`** for state-wide data: `USA_TENNESSEE`, `USA_COLORADO`.
2. **Prefer `COUNTRYCODE_CITY`** for metro-specific data: `USA_SEATTLE`, `USA_CHICAGO`.
3. **Avoid currency codes** in custom regions unless you are deliberately building a broad national market.
4. **Keep it uppercase** and use underscores: `USA_TENNESSEE`, not `usa_tennessee` or `USA-Tennessee`.
5. **Stay consistent** within a region set. Do not mix `USA_NASHVILLE` and `USA_TENNESSEE` for the same data.

## Appendix C: Recommended Data Strategy for US Sitework

### Immediate (Free, Already Implemented)

1. **FEMA Equipment Rates** for equipment cost items (replaces USACE, more current).
2. **BLS OEWS** for labor wage items (API-accessible, annual updates).
3. **State DOT bid prices** for validation items (start with TDOT, add others as needed).
4. **Local material quotes** for manual market estimates.

### Near-Term (Free, Moderate Effort)

5. **Davis-Bacon wage determinations** for prevailing wage items (requires a SAM.gov scraper).
6. **Additional state DOT data** for CA (Caltrans), FL (FDOT), TX (TxDOT), WI.

### Medium-Term (Paid, High Value)

7. **A commercial estimator handbook (API)** for general building costs.
8. **A published cost-index subscription** for cost indexes and material prices for escalation.
